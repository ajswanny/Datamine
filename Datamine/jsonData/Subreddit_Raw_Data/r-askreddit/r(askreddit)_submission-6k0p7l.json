Learn the signs, symptoms, etc., and know where to forward the survivors to the proper agencies. Additionally there are some things on how to secure relief sites in consideration for physical and mental health.\n\nThere are also free courses on the website regarding helping children and military families with specific issues, but since I have not taken them yet I cannot comment on those classes.\n\nEDIT: Yes, the class teaches you how to deal with both children and adults. Due to the nature of the training, psychological first aid can be comfortably taught online because there are no physical demands. I completed this in a day to enhance my resume for a masters program in psychology a while back. It looks very sharp on a resume. I hope this helps!\n\nEDIT: The course is tailored to the U.S., but the ideas should be easily applicable anywhere. Anyone may register for a class online and take it at their own pace. If there are any issues, please let me know so I may update this post.\n\nEDIT: Psychological First Aid is more designed towards a large-scale response. For individual psychological training, consider the [QTR Institute](https://www.qprinstitute.com/professional-training) which trains you in suicide prevention techniques in multiple different settings and environments.

So, I'd like to elaborate this topic a bit. First of all, my apologies for giving the wrong URL. I have now updated the correct URL. Register with your Gmail ID. For those wondering, NPTEL (National Programme on Technology Enhanced Learning) is a joint initiative of the IITs and IISc. Through this initiative, they offer online courses and certification in various topics. I am not sure they offer courses for International users. Course is free, but you need to pay for the exam and certification. At the time of enrolling a course in NPTEL I paid Rs.1000 INR. I got a certificate (hard copy). The certificate is pretty neat, decent, well framed. I enrolled a course titled \"Information security\". It was 6 level course. I completed only one level. They provide assignments during the course. You need to complete the assignments in order to be eligible for the exam. You can view list of online certification courses from NPTEL to be offered between July-November 2017 in this link: http://nptel.ac.in/LocalChapter/Assets/spoc_refdocs/Tentative_course_list_July_2017.pdf\n",

It used to cost $50 but now it\u2019s completely off charge. Once you have their certificate, your value on the market drastically increases. After all, which business wouldn\u2019t like to hire a person with thorough knowledge concerning internet ads and marketing? It is supposed to take about a week of studying to pass it. You will find plenty of information on this topic on the web, we can recommend [this page](https://www.launchdigitalmarketing.com/how-to-pass-google-analytics-certification/).\n\n**2. FEMA Certification** \n\nShow your potential boss that you can handle conflicts, and that you possess the basic (or even slightly higher) knowledge of the command structure. It may be a bit tedious but it\u2019s definitely worth your effort!\n\nUnfortunately, this one is available only to American citizens. But don\u2019t worry if you do not live in the United States, there still may be a chance for you to get the FEMA certification. Try the link [here](https://training.fema.gov/hiedu/collegelist/othercountries/) for the other countries.\n\n**3. The Psychological First Aid Online.**\n\nWhich, once you sign up there, gives you an opportunity to participate in a test hosted by the National Child Traumatic Stress Network and promoted by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. It takes about six hours but it is not dull at all.\n\nYou learn how to deal with extreme situations \u2013 if (knock on wood) a disaster occurs, you will have means to react immediately, and perhaps, save many human lives. You are learning the symptoms and signs of severe psychological distress and you know how to help survivors and forward them to those institutions that will be able to provide help.\n\nYou learn how to aid both adults and children, you will also know how to secure relief sites, and if you are still hungry for knowledge, there are courses that will tell you how to help people with specific issues, including military families. This looks great on your resume, no matter the job.\n\n**4.

Don't think of salesforce as your traditional rigid tool. You can customize it programmatically and declaratively to fit how you do your business, allowing you to build and enhance your database of customer data (who your customer and prospects are, what your sales are, support tickets, etc). The users of salesforce are your marketing guy, your seller, your support rep, the guy who comes on location to fix the internet issue, etc.\n\nMoreover, Salesforce has a thriving third party ecosystem (think app store for business applications) that further multiply the value of the platform. You can do electronic signature, ecommerce, fulfillment, true BI and analytics and a variety of other things.\n\nLastly, you can build completely custom applications in Salesforce using apex, visualforce , lightning and other langiages.",

    "body": "Just took the entire course and passed the test. Here's my new certificate: http://imgur.com/kW3A9nq\n\n\nAnd no. No it does not. In fact, in many places in the course it uses male gender specific terms and does not even once mention women or otherwise. Here are some bits I snagged while I went through the course:\n\n\n\"5. What kinds of heart attacks are there and how can I help?\u00a0\n\n\nThere are actually three presentations of a heart attacks and if you are the first person upon the scene, you are called the first responder. The first responder is the good samaritan who performs CPR, calls 911 or convinces a potential victim to get medical help as soon as possible.\n\n\nType 1:\u00a0The heart attack stops you dead in your tracks. This is called the CPR scene. In the first type of heart attack, we need to know cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and perform it well.\u00a0\n\n\nType 2:\u00a0A heart attack where damage is taking place (the six hours we have talked about). The patient is experiencing the Mack truck sitting on his chest. Call 911 and behave as an executive spouse because the patient usually does not put up much of a fuss, is in severe pain and is weak like a kitten.\n\n\n\nType 3:\u00a0The heart attack is just beginning and EHAC provides a beneficial impact. This is the most difficult time to get someone to seek medical care. The victim will normally complain, but then excuse it as food poisoning or gas. The patient has minimal symptoms but is practicing maximal deniability. The patient to first responder interaction can be frustrating. The patient may be embarrassed or wants to ignore it. At this point, they can convince the first responder to contribute to the denial. Even paramedics find it difficult to convince a conscious patient to go to the hospital. This is the reason why the heart attack remains the number one killer of the adult population.\u00a0\n\n\n\n6. Is there a secret to working out the problem? How can it be turned around?\u00a0\nThe first responder (or bystander) has to become knowledgeable and know that the time to help the patient is when the heart attack is in the beginning stages. Be prepared to argue for the patient to seek out an early check up in an emergency room. It is important to be active or proactive and be heart smart. A Good Samaritan will solve the problem with their timely actions.\n\n\n\n7. Why is denial such an important part of the unraveling of the heart attack problem?\u00a0\nBecause it is part of our lifestyle. We constantly forget about ourselves and live our lives as if we are indestructible or immortal, and only are brought to reality when we are taken to our knees. However, we can minimize the damage and change the outcome. A heart attack - even in its infancy stages - is a great transformer and a great reality check. The secret is to nip it when it is in the beginning stage, i.e., chest discomfort before the severe damage or the sudden death.\n\n\n\n8. How can I help someone?\u00a0\nWe review several strategies in Section 3 of this document, but a great tip to remember is that the faster someone receives medical care, the better chance they have to regain their full life. If someone manages to survive a heart attack, their life is forever changed and they have a slim chance of living the life they once enjoyed.\n\n\n\n9. Any final words?\u00a0\nYes, I ask people if they were to develop a blockage in one of their heart vessels, what scenario would they like to be in and have action taken? Pumping on the chest for a cardiac arrest victim, helping a patient with a Mack truck sitting on his chest and trying to get him into the hospital or perhaps encouraging a patient with minimal symptoms to have it checked out - to be safe rather than sorry. Several hours here can make the difference between a pleasurable and enjoyable life versus no life or cardiac invalidism. Be alert, be active, be heart smart - be an Early Heart Attack Care provider.\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the game plan?\n\n\n\n1. Heart attacks have beginnings.\u00a0 Educate the public to\u00a0recognize\u00a0the early warning signs:\n\n\nMild chest pain, pressure, or discomfortRecurring pain or discomfort in the chest that occurs with activity and subsides while at restShortness of breathA burning feeling in the throat and chin that can be confused with heartburn or indigestion\n\n\n\n2. Educate the public to\u00a0respond\u00a0immediately to prevent heart damage and crashes to sudden death.\n\n\n\nYour action can save lives.\u00a0 Whether you are experiencing the early symptoms yourself or you are a witness to someone else experiencing early symptoms of heart attack, you can become an early cardiac care giver by insisting on medical attention.\n\n\nHow can Early Heart Attack Care be taught to others?\n\n\nThe more ways we reach people, the better chance we have of topping heart attack as the number one killer of adults in the United States.\u00a0 The message is simple.\u00a0\u00a0Share the message to\u00a0\"Recognize the symptoms and act immediately.\"\u00a0 Health courses in high schools and community colleges can teach early warning signs and responses.\u00a0Paramedics, firemen, policemen, educators, physical fitness instructors, the general public, and you may be the first responders to someone experiencing the early signs of heart attack.\u00a0 Your action can save a life.\"\n\n\n",

I'd say SQL is a good 'gateway' language, and having a solid understanding of how to design a database *correctly* gives you a big advantage over other developers who think DBs are a necessary evil and just slop stuff together.  \n  \nGreat courses for MS SQL Server at http://www.sqlservercentral.com/stairway/. I don't think there's a shiny cert at the end, but MS SQL is the Fortune 500 enterprise-level flavor of SQL (along with Oracle SQL).

    "body": "Sure thing!  I explained it in another comment, so I'm just going to copy pasta:\n\n> This isn't an investment bond, it is a surety bond. It's basically a document that makes you financially responsible for damages that you can cause with a special license or some other professional standing. Essentially, the document is held by an insurance company that handles surety bonds, and if you break the terms of the agreement, the harmed party can collect upto the amount of the bond. The insurance company pays out the claim, and then they bill you for it.\n\n> That way it is the insurance company that has to deal with collecting the debt from you, and the party that was harmed by your action can get the money more quickly.\n\n>These types of bonds are very common in construction, mortgage lending, debt collection, and motor vehicle sales.\n\n>edit: forgot to add, you obtain these by paying a premium to said insurance company. Typically the premiums are annual, but it depends on the type of surety bond. Some surety bonds are considered higher risk than others, so the higher the risk the harder it is to get the bond. Usually you have to pass a credit check or deal with some other kind of underwriting, but not so much with the Notary bonds, as they are considered low risk.\n\nedit: to be more specific about why a Notary needs a bond, it is because if you do not notarize a document correctly, it can invalidate the document.  If this happens under certain circumstances, it can potentially cost the affected party monetarily.  In which case, the bond is basically there to make the Notary easier to sue.  Which is basically why Surety bonds exist.  I.e. You're a contractor and you fail to finish a job, now the people that paid you for that job have to find another contractor, but they've already sunk money into you so now they don't have the funds to finish the project.  They collect on the bond to regain their money, and they hire a new contractor.  In the meantime, the insurance company that holds the bond works on collecting the debt from you.\n\nThese used to mostly just be for very large contracts.  Like government level contracts building big stretches of road and such.  That way, if a contractor fails, the government wouldn't have to spend months/years in court trying to get the money back to finish the project while a road is all messed up.\n\nNow there are Surety bonds for all kinds of licenses.  It depends on the state, but in a lot of places, mortgage brokers, used car dealers, small contractors, and debt collectors all have to have surety bonds just to maintain their licenses.  If you're aware of this, it gives you some leverage against them if they screw you over.  You utilize this leverage by threatening to place a claim on their bond, which can be done with something as simple as a hand written note to the insurance company.  The insurance companies are really jumpy about claims on these things, so they'll put that persons bond on hold while they investigate the issue.  In the meantime, the state will be informed that the bond is on hold and they will place a hold on that persons license.  So essentially, with a note, you can stop a person from legally doing business.  This doesn't happen often because most people don't know these things even exist, and the professionals that hold them aren't likely to mention it to anyone as it is a huge liability.",

So I simply added \"Open to New Opportunities\" to my LinkedIn description, so I didn't openly advertise I was looking since your coworkers and HR scan LinkedIn from time to time. But anyways I got hit up with tons of recruiters within a day, most of the jobs I had no interest in and didn't even get responses since they were canned messages. I got one recruiter which actually personalized (These are the good jobs!) her message, I followed up and had a phone interview same day and a onsite interview the next week, they liked me so much I had a offer 3 hours later. As for my current job I got since I had worked with my VP at the job I was leaving and in small/medium town, he heard and had a position that I would excel. The offer I got from the earlier interview I wanted to decline because they just said they had no software budget, I got the call from my friend just a few hours after that.\n\nThe short story is recruiters use LinkedIn like it is there life line, you got get as many or as little jobs as you want. Also its all about who you know, I got 3 of my jobs because of who I know and the others were. So I was exaggerating about how many I got from LinkedIn, but all the interviews and experience I got from LinkedIn. Let me know what the market looked like and how I could market myself especially in my town.\n\nI highly recommend LinkedIn and I'm willing to give more suggestions and advice then I have time for most days. But if you don't have a good LinkedIn your not going to get a good job or you will get passed up and left behind in the dust of IT due to how fast the field changes. Everything I speak to students I praise LinkedIn and maybe 5% actually listen, those 5% actually excel while the others stay in HellDesk.\n\nI should also note I'm 23 and all of this has happened so don't feel left behind or panic, go ahead and make one as my advice is it takes 2 years to build a good one since you need connections.",

    "body": "Everyone's different, so take that into consideration.. \n\nBut anxiety you feel from anxiety disorders feels (at least to me) rather different than anxiety related to heart issues and impending heart attack.\n\nI had a heart attack at 26, unexpectedly.  I found out I have HoFH which causes super high cholesterol, so not random at least.\n\nBut for months before it happened, I felt doomed.  To the point that as someone who just turned 26, I started a journal to write to my kids so they could remember me, and took out life insurance. When the attacks happened (I had a minor one and then major the next day, I later found out), I felt a different type of anxious I never have before and never since. I wanted to sleep. I wanted to be alone. I wanted to be someplace away. I curled up against an old dishwasher we had on our unused back porch (really in interior like mud room).  We never go back there, but it drew me to it and I sat there alone until I recovered. Second day, big one, I did the same, couldn't help it.  Then felt worse and worse and tried to go to bed and sleep.  Luckily hyperventilating caused my hands to clench and my forearms were in pain, so I couldn't sleep.  Then threw up a lot, got hot and then cooled suddenly as I sweat buckets.  \n\nNo chest pain or shoulder pain.  But in retrospect, the entire week I had been having a deep ache in my forearms when I sat in one spot too long (like at desk at work) or when I moved too much (walking up stairs).  It was a rough week, but I never would have guessed.  My cardiologist would have.\n\nSorry, that was longer than I meant to reply, but anyways the point is if you have a severe anxiety attack and can get help for it, go for it.  If you have general anxiety, or you have panic attacks on a regular basis you will likely be able to tell a bit of difference though.",
