He left in the middle of the show.  \n\nAlso fun fact:  The Beatles US concerts were notorious for being so loud with young girls screaming that most people couldn't hear the music.  They didn't even bother tuning their guitars.  But then when they came to Japan, the crowd really wanted to hear so they were fairly silent and they had to stop the show to get all the instruments tuned up and mic'd properly.",

    "body": "Alright so my older brother was like 10, I was like 5, and he loved Pokemon. I mean LOVED it, got the cards and games, plastic cases for the cards to protect them. Kid went to a convention in town, talking to some older kids and gents who loved the game, and on his way out he realized that his favorite, and consequently highest valued card, was stolen from him by one of those older kids/grown men. We found the guy but no one could prove it was ours in the first place. He was so heart broken. \n\nMy grandma, god bless her soul, went out of her way and bought this expensive ass charizard holographic thing, exactly what he had, for a crazy amount of money online. She then took about four ordinary ass booster decks, opened each one to check for the card, obviously it's rare so she finds none. She takes a useless potion card out and slid in the expensive ass card into one of the boosters, sealed it with a lighter, then taped all four together so that the last one was the altered booster. \n\nBirthday rolls around, brother is doing his thing, happy but every Pok\u00e9mon gift kinda brings him down, he misses that card and is sad about the lack of justice or reprimand for that asshole making him so sad. He gets to the final gift, Mimi's gift, we pull out the video recorder and watch. He goes through the first three boosters, gets some good cards and his friends are laughing and looking at them, he's a little happier. Final pack, gets through all the cards before the charizard, and bah god the look on his face at that last card, I swear he was crying and jumping around, ran straight to Mimi and hugged her so tight. He thought she had just gotten lucky, but after she passed away we told him that she had done that. I don't remember it well myself, just the way my parents told me and the video itself, which has been long lost after four movings :( but I'll never forget how incredible it was to see both the worst and best of humans in this story of some charizard card. \n\nEdit: it\u2019s nice to see people respond with love and kindness to this story so long after I\u2019ve posted it. I appreciate you all, it\u2019s a happy surprise to see a good message now and then because of someone I love. ",

I had worked the opening shift, and was asked to come in a little early to help set up all the displays. \n\nPeople were camped outside for a few hours before the store opened. About 30 minutes before the store opened, I could see this seething, undulating mass of humanity crowded outside the doors, waiting for them to open so they could grab their copy. I swear it looked like a few of them were trying to Jedi Mind Trick me into opening the doors early.\n\nI was making jokes with my fellow employees, when my manager came and asked me to stand by the doors so I could direct the incoming horde to the various displays (there were 2 or 3 of them I think). As I took my place near the doors, the store manager approached the front doors of the store to open them, and I saw the entire mass tense like they were about to run a gauntlet.\n\nAs soon as the doors opened, the human ocean outside burst its way in. I raised my hand to wave to them in greeting, but before I could get my arm halfway up to greeting position, I was slammed off of my feet as they ran past me. It was like I wasn't even there.\n\nI picked myself up, with no injuries other than my pride, and saw these piranhas devour the first display they came to. Within minutes (it seemed), the display was empty. Some customers who hadn't grabbed a copy (and didn't realize that we had more in stock), started pushing and shouting, and it looked like there might be a brawl erupting at any moment. I tried to tell everyone that we had more, but they were shouting over me. One kid (maybe 9 or 10 years old) was standing next to his mom and crying because he hadn't managed to get a copy. His mom was trying to console him, while moving him away from the riotous mass in front of them.\n\nI went back to the crowd, finally it got quiet enough so I could explain that we had more in stock. The remaining crowd rushed to the other displays, and I pulled a copy aside for the boy and his mom and handed it to them so they wouldn't have to be near the assholes who were ready to fight each other.\n\nAll of this shit for fucking Jar Jar Binks.

He said \u201cwe\u2019ll I\u2019ll just leave it here so you have to give me one\u201d. He thought if he left it with us it would have to be counted as returned.

Dude flips out again, hits a display case, and slams the door so hard the frame rattles\n\nA few days later we get a call from someone at his bank, he attempted a chargeback and they wanted our side of the story.

We get there like a half hour early, pretty close to the front of the line and waiting to go inside. I'd never done black Friday prior to this so I was not prepared for the idiocy that would ensue. They opened the doors and everyone sprinted into the door, like full fucking sprint and people were trying to push us out of the way as we were just walking to go inside. I make my way to the back of the store where the electronics department is, meanwhile there are people literally darting around the store grabbing item after item looking like rabid maniacs.\n\nI get to the back of the store and I see a stack of ps4s and a line of people waiting for them, so I get to the back of the line and the closer I get the smaller the pile of ps4s gets. At this point I'm just accepting that I probably won't get one and it's really not a big deal, only reason I was picking one up was to save a few bucks. Well, I'm second in line and there is one more ps4 on the stack, the lady and her son in front of me are about to get it but I couldn't quite tell if it was the last one because people were everywhere and i didn't have a clear line of sight.\n\nSo I ask her \"Hey, can you tell if that's the last one?\", she then turns around looks me dead in the eye and says \"You're damn right it is and you're not going to fucking get it, understand asshole?\"\n\nI was dumbfounded honestly, so I just kind of shook my head and told her that it wasn't that big of a deal as she continued to make snide comments under her breath and people all over the store were arguing and fighting for different items or yelling at the employees to find things and just generally being rude as fuck. The lady gets her ps4 that she was ready to fight to the death for and walks away giving me the stare of death, and I just shake it off and ask the employee who was handing them out if there were any left. \n\nSure enough they had another pallet in the back and were just waiting to bring them out, so I ended up getting one but I've never seen so many people act so god damn rude over material items. It was the first and last time I have ever attending any store for black Friday, never again. We also went to several other stores that night for my Ex and all of them were equally terrible, guess this isn't really a fanboy story but it was just people all melting down in public by the droves.",

It was too long ago to remember the exact conversation but she essentially asked me if she could walk around the store in her suit handing out pamphlets on furry culture.

She could have gotten attacked if she approached the wrong dog in the wrong way). She would NOT relent. I started to become irritated at this point and told her she would have to leave.

OK, they got the day wrong and I'll just go to the next store.

    "body": "Worked at a movie theater in high school. Our boss (obviously because it's his job) was very strict on Rated-R movies, and checking ID's. One of my co-workers was working box office on the night \"American Sniper\" came out. A group of obviously younger than 17-year-olds came up to buy tickets from him. He asked for their ID's, none of them even had permits yet. They asked him to just let it go, he said no. Then, the \"alpha\" of the group gets up against the class and starts threatening my co-worker's life, saying that he will go home, get his dad's gun, and shoot him, unless he lets the group buy tickets.\n\nIt's funny, because even if he sold them tickets, they would've gone inside to the usher, and the manager with the usher would've asked for their ID's and they would've been sent back outside for refunds.\n\nSuch is life in a crumbling suburb.\n\nEdit: Obligatory \"this blew up over night\" along with, my now most upvoted comment is about how my co-worker's life was threatened by a teenager. Thanks Reddit! \n\nEdit 2: So I want to explain. Every weekend, there was a group of kids that would come into the theater, and usually cause some kind of trouble and get kicked out. Basically, their parent dropped them off at the mall on Saturday morning, and they'd go buy shit all day, then come into the theater. Sometimes they'd be civil and see a movie, other times they would be yelling in the movie, or causing a ruckus in the game room. We'd call the cops on them sometimes, but they'd usually run before the cops got there. This was the only time we'd ever call the cops.\n\nThe night the one guy got threatened by the kid, we called mall security to escort them off the property, because we knew the cops wouldn't get there in time.\n\nEdit 3: I have two stories that are worse, in my opinion. One is below in the comments, here is another.\n\nThe group of kids that I mentioned above came into the theater one Saturday night. They went to their movie, and at some point started yelling, screaming, and causing issues in the movie. After we got a complaint from a customer, we went in, observed their behavior, and decided to kick them out. While the manager was escorting them away, one girl in the group kept verbally assaulting him. When they made it out to the lobby, she jumped over the concessions stand, and started throwing popcorn, drinks, etc. at the workers behind the stand. We called the cops immediately, and they were their within a few minutes. They literally had to drag this crazy chick away, and threw her into the back of their car. \n\nI don't know the movie they were seeing, but our manager told them they were gonna get refunds, so I can't imagine why someone would react like this.",

I had a feeling they were going to screw up the presale so I showed up around when the doors opened.  I got back to the electronics area and sure enough they were selling the stock on a first come first served basis.  \n\nThe line was like 10 customers deep and they only had a few left.  So I find the manager and asked to have my presale unit.  Well he goes over to the counter and announces \"If anyone has a presale number please let us know\"  So I raise my hand.  \n\nSo he hands me the last black unit.  To do this he literally took it out of the cashier's hand who was selling it to a dad with his son.  The dad looked relieved.  Literally like \"well...we tried son.  Maybe in a few weeks.\"  And the kid was like bummed but not too bad.  \n\nBut then there's like this mid 20s Asian guy.  \"Sir, would  you like the white unit?\"  \n\n\"No.  I don't want the white one.  I WANTED THAT ONE.\"  Screamed the last part.  Literally started crying.  \n\nGrown ass adult.  \n\nIf the kid was upset I would have considered giving it to him.

You want it that bad, you pre order like I did.  \n\ntl;dr  got laid.  \n\nActually...probably didn't right away since she was playing some Mario BS for awhile.

It sucked, but what can you do?\n\nWell, some people thought what you could do was, angrily shout at, harass, and verbally abuse the con staff. It was a bit of an embarassment.\n\nMe? Was fortunate to have a bold friend who took us to the front while everyone was leaving. Leaned they had hastily printed up impromptu \"jump the line\" passes for people to use the next morning. So we got them, went back to the hotel and had a pretty cool morning.\n\nStill have that \"Jump the Line\" pass somewhere as a keepsake.",

Lady was not having it, but after my manager said \"We have 20 nuggets ready to eat. We will have to drop over 200 nuggets to fulfill your order and each batch of 20 takes 5 minutes.

So come back later after you *call in* your order.\" Surprising the lady did just that from the payphone in the parking lot and came by to get 150 cold and 50 warmish nuggets 2 hours later after the lunch rush.  \n\nAnyway, we pack all of these in cardboard boxes to load into her van after she pays for them. Lady pays, we load them up and for the next 20 minutes the lady sits by the dumpster throwing away 47 4-piece nuggets, small fries and drinks as she pulls out and catalogs the haul.  \n\nSuch a waste of food, energy and money. Oh, and her van already had several hundred beanie babies from the previous 3 weeks. How do I know 3 weeks?

I was confused because I had clearly gotten to the box first but she told me \"give me it, you little bitch\". I was clearly confused, so I did the only logical thing in my mind.

I explained that I didn't have it, and that there's no way I could promise it there by Christmas Day (it was ~4PM the day before.) and that unfortunatly all the other stores were out (It was a sale item and had been on sale about a week).\n\nWell, she started to lose her shit. It started with \"Are you kidding me!? You aren't going to give it to me! I'll give you an extra $40!\" I'm sorry I can't take any extra money and even if I could I don't have it to give \"FINE ILL DOUBLE IT\" No i'm sorry I don't have it, it doesn't exist.\" I offer other options, from different colors of the same desk to knocking down the price on another desk. \n\nThis is where she starts screaming that *I* ruined her kids Christmas because all they wanted was a desk and I won't give it to her. She tells me she hopes i'm happy that he's going to cry tomorrow morning and that it's my fault and the Office Depots fault. That she can't believe we don't carry enough furniture for the demand on Christmas (..Furniture isn't a big Christmas seller at OD, and even if it were what store is going to risk left over inventory. Not that she cares)\n\nShe tells me i'm an asshole and that she can't believe i'd treat her son this way. She then marches out of the store declaring she's never coming back.\n\n\n\nOther crazies include: Lady who comes back for 3 weeks every day demanding from each employee and manager that we order her a black friday only chromebook model for the black friday price (after black friday).\n\nLady who threw ink at me because I wouldn't return it when it was years old and used. Told me she would never be back.\n\nGuy who screamed at me when I had him sign paperwork allowing us to work on his computer when he wanted his computer worked on. He shook violently and marched around because I expected him to sign \"legaliese\" I politely told him if he wanted to change his mind we didn't have to work on the machine. Nope, still pissed at me. Thought he would swing. He told my manager \"I'm not calling him a fucker, i'm calling you one\" when my manager told him not to speak to associates that way.\n\nLady who filled her babies carrier with product to steal. \n\nGuy who complained that I was lazy and wouldn't help him because I was helping another customer. When I tried to help him he ignored me multiple times and walked away.\n\nGuy who used forged checks to pay for canned air habit gets upset when he comes in months later and we choose to ID him when he uses a credit card.\n\nGuy tells me my print associate is \"a bitch\" because she wont give him free prints. Is surprised when I tell him she's right.\n\nGuy who keeps giving money to phone scams and blaming us even though we told him not to at least 20 times.\n\nGuy who stole beats headphones by ripping the locking peg off the wall. Is followed next door by manager who waits outside bathroom, cops called. Cops show up to him naked in the bathroom changing as an attempt to hide identity headphones with him. Claims \"You got the wrong guy\"\n\n\n\n",

If you didn't pre-order, especially on a AAA title, you ran the risk of not getting the game and having to wait a week or so for them to get another shipment.\n\n>I agree that pre-ordering is stupid now. But there was a time when you had to. And companies took that need and started adding all the bonuses and bullshit that everyone hates now. Today, digital downloads and overstock has eliminated the need for pre-orders, but back then, pre-orders were the only way to be sure you'd get a copy of the game on its release date.\n\n\n[Here's a link to someone talking about the 'pre-order bonus' you got for pre-ordering Skyrim. Behold 2011 pre-order incentives in all their evil glory!](https://www.giantbomb.com/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim/3030-33394/forums/the-gamestop-pre-order-bonus-and-why-i-love-it-505876/) tl;dr it's a cloth map.\n\n*EDIT 2*\n\nPeople... When I called myself an 'old-timer' I wasn't just referring to the release of Skyrim. I was just finishing up 8 years in the US Marine Corps when it was released in 2011. I'm not some 17 year old talking about my youth. I had been gaming for many years prior to its release and continue to do so...",

    "body": "Wii release night was the closest I came to flipping my shit. I showed up at Walmart at around 5PM, planning to stay in line till they started selling at midnight. They got annoyed with us asking where to line up, so they said \"Alright, at 9PM we will announce where a line in the store is. We will give out tokens for the Wii's as we only have a few. If you get a token, you will get a Wii. If you do NOT get a token, you will NOT get a Wii. Come back at midnight to redeem your token for a Wii.\". So my mom proposed taking me home where we could have dinner, then show up at 8:30 or so. Well, we get there at 8:20 and I find out they got so sick and tired of people demanding to know where the line would form that they went ahead and told them at like 7:30 or so, but they would wait till 9 to give the tokens out. I ran over to the line and sure as shit, they ran out of tokens on the person RIGHT in front of me.\n\nAs we were walking away, me cursing under my breath and trying to contain my adolescent rage, I saw a tiny line outside the Best Buy (which I knew would only sell at opening in the morning). I loudly declared to my mom that she was going to drop me off there, and I don't care if my dad showed up personally, I was NOT going home till I had my Wii!\n\nShe laughed and dropped me off, and I was like 3rd in line or so. It was one of the most fun nights of my young life. Everybody in line was pretty awesome, we chatted, played games (the BB ran an extension cord out for us). The best part was one guy that was in line with his friend, but didn't even intend to buy a Wii for himself, his mom swung by every hour on the hour to deliver an honest to god CAULDRON of hot chocolate.\n\nI got my Wii in the morning, went home, stuck it under my pillow so my brothers couldn't play with it without me, and then went to bed.\n\nOf course the thing that DID piss me off, was that I didn't bring it with me on my Freshman year of college so I could focus on studies. When I decided to bring it after the first semester, my younger brother had declared it was his, that he had paid for it, that my story never happened, and was going absolutely bat-shit over the idea of me taking it with me to the point where my parents flat out refused to let me have it. To this day he insists it is his.",

I think they also lost points for safety violations but that's irrelevant.\n\nWhat is relevant is that they had a quarterly catalog where you could spend those points to buy stuff. 3 of the catalogs had normal stuff like BBQ grills, electronic gadgets, home decor, etc. The fourth catalog had all of that year's popular Christmas gifts in it. Oilfield workers would save points all year and do all of their Christmas shopping in the catalog. Anyway, there were over a thousand orders for those Elmos and the warehouse received exactly zero of them.\n\nChaos ensued. People got yelled at, dispatchers got cursed out, people got fired, one of the high-ups in the company had his vehicle vandalized, and safety violation reports went through the roof.\n\nThankfully, my brother and I were a few years too old to enjoy a toy like that so we got a Nintendo 64.

I can't stand anything anime related to this day.\n\nEDIT: to clarify (because a couple of people complained about it for some reason) I don't think anime itself is bad, or that all anime shows are bad. i just have a negative gut reaction when i see it because of all these experiences.\n\nEDIT 2, because people are still complaining about my wording: I know anime has always been growing in popularity, it's just different places learn about new trends slower than others. I grew up in a conservative small town filled with farmers and old people so people tend to be behind on new things there. anime wasn't popular *in my area* until around high school.",

Someone we both knew told me later that my ex said to them that he wouldn't return me my toy because he knew how much it would hurt me not to get it back. Oh and he sold my mountainbike and probably anything else that was worth something. Fuck that asshole.\n\n\nEDIT to answer some of your questions: \n\n-No, I didn't cheat on him or anything else that would justify his behaviour.\n\n-Yes, there were many red flags before, he was abusive during the relationship. Honestly I never should have trusted him, but I was stupid, that's why I ended up with him in the first place.\n\n-Yes, I've leaned a lot from the whole relationship and I would never let myself being treated that way again. Ever.\n-No, I did not go to court. I just wanted to forget about him and the way he treated me. Also it wouldn't have brought me my stuff back or any money because he did not have any money. For the major part of our relationship he didn't even have a job, so maybe I would have ended up with having to pay him aliments.\n\n-I broke up with him four years ago and am now in a happy and healthy relationship with a very nice guy :-)\n\n\nThank you reddit for making my highest rated comment about my shitty ex BF, at least something good came out of it lol.",

Well, the fan wrote it in her own menstrual blood and included pubic hair. \n\n* Jessica from Girl's Generation once told a story where she got out of a taxi in front of her apartment building and saw a strange man outside. She noticed that he started following her. As she picked up her pace, so did he. When she finally managed to safely get inside her apartment, she saw the handle start jiggling as the guy was trying to get in. Thankfully for her, he just left. \n\n* D.O. from the group Exo had a pair of his underwear stolen from his apartment and the person made a listing selling it online. \n\n* Speaking of Exo, one fan rented a van that looked very similar to theirs to pick them up. And they almost entered it. Fortunately, their manager realized what was up and stopped them from entering it. \n\n* Jonghyun from CNBLUE found a fan who hid herself in his room. \n\n* Jeongyeon from TWICE was going to her sister's house. When her sister scolded (presumably teasingly) her about being late, Jeongyeon broke into tears because she had to go in a roundabout-way to get there because people were following her and she didn't want her sister's address to be found out. \n\n* Upon returning, the members of FT Island found that their apartment had been broken into and ransacked as fans had stolen personal belongings of the members. To make matters even worse (and disgusting), these fans had left their feces on the apartment floor. \n\n* And there's the infamous incident where a guy literally [tried to kidnap Taeyeon from Girl's Generation]( https://youtu.be/YfxzyDE_rlk) *while she was performing on stage*",

You'd hand the item to be signed to a guard who walked it over and delivered any messages you had, then the item was walked back and you were handed it and gently escorted away from the line.\n\nWith American security, you are right up at the table with them and can shake their hands. One of the voice actors was asked about it during a panel and he said it was somewhat terrifying (as he'd had a fan he met on the street in Japan hand him something to sign, and when the guy reached out to take it, the fan ripped his sleeve off and ran away shrieking in joy) but when nothing bad happened, he said it was amazing and he loved getting up close with fans.",
