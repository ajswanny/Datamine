    "body": "A common misconception about being gay is that the awareness of being gay is any different than the awareness of being straight.\n\nHere's how I know I'm straight (I'm a guy).  At a certain age, I started feeling differently around girls.  I liked to look at them in a certain way.  I liked to hear their voices, and to be around them.  I liked to dance with them and hold their hands.  I liked to kiss them and hug them, and talk on the phone to them well into the night.  In \"serious\" relationships, I would feel like there just wasn't enough time, because we each had to go to our respective homes, instead of just staying up all night and talking, which was all we wanted to do.\n\nEventually I learned that this was what it was like to be straight.  But I never thought of it as being straight.  It was just how I was.\n\nMy son is gay.  And all I can hope is that he has the opportunity to feel the same things while he's young as I did at his age.  And I don't care who he feels that way about, nearly as much as some people think I should.",

    "body": "Here's an actual answer: http://www.bentvoices.org/bentvoices/feinstein-blindandgay.htm\n\nEdit: The whole story is worth a read, but here is a relevant bit:\n\n> I knew that I was very different from the other kids, and I felt horribly lonely. I didn't fit in with the sighted kids, but what was worse, I didn't fit in with the blind kids, either. All the boys were interested in sports and rough games. I wasn't. Some talked about girls, but because I was blind from birth, and because nobody ever talked to me about sex, I had no idea what was being discussed. I am ashamed to say that I didn't even know the difference between girls and boys, except that girls were usually nicer to me, and yet, I felt a strange feeling when hugging a male student.\n\n>When I was 15 years old, a girl explained to me how babies were born. \"You're very stupid!\" Harriet told me. \"Your father stuck his penis in your mother's hole, and that's how you were born. Don't you know anything?\" I wanted to ask more questions. Where was this hole? What was all this talk about \"hard-ons\" and \"erections?\" But I knew that if I admitted how little I knew, I'd be laughed at, so I kept quiet. I could not ask my mother. She never talked about such things, and I knew she would only be upset and tell me not to ask so many questions. So, I ordered books in braille about sex, and read them, and had a vague understanding.\n\n>What is surprising, and very important, is that I began to realize that I was attracted to other boys and men, and not to women. I realized that I had a strange feeling when close to people of my own sex that I did not have when I was with women. I somehow knew that this was not the way it should be, and never mentioned it to anyone. ",

    "body": "Hi, this is Bob, the fellow who wrote the article about being blind and gay. A friend is helping me navigate the website. I have a few things to say. First of all, I want to thank the person who put my article on this website. I wrote the article quite a long time ago and was surprised to suddenly receive a few emails from people who had recently read my article. I was also very touched by the interest my article attracted. I originally wrote the article hoping to make new friends and contacts. Unfortunately, this did not happen. Many people read the article and liked it but they didn't keep in touch with me. Now that the article has appeared again, I am hoping to meet some new people. \n\nMy situation has stayed pretty much the same. I no longer have a guide dog and I'm quite a bit older :) I am now 67 years old. \n\nSome have suggested that my situation proves that being gay is not a choice. I agree with this 100%. When I was 11 or 12, I didn't really understand the difference between boys and girls. To me, they were the same except that men turned me on and women didn't. I did not know about body parts (breasts, vagina, penis, etc.) and yet, I was attracted to my same sex. Because of my unique situation, I can tell you that being gay is not a choice. \n\nI am truly touched by the interest my article is generating and I want to encourage those of you who are interested to contact me by using my email, harlynn \"at\" panix.com. I cannot use this website without help. My friend is typing this for me, but I want to be able to communicate with people on my own and I can only do this by email. \n\nI would like to mention the fact that there are many blind people who once had sight and became blind later in life. Their situation is very different from mine because they grew up sighted. There are some blind people who lost their sight at an early age, but again, they have memories that I do not have. I am among a small minority of blind people who have never seen at all. People sometimes ask me, \"Do you see dark? Do you see black?\" The answer is no, because I don't know what black is, I don't know what light is, I don't know what colors are. So when I meet someone, what I go by is their voice, their smell, their kindness, and their willingness to help me when needed. Probably one advantage of being blind and gay is that I get to walk with all my friends arm in arm and nobody says anything. Sometimes, I will even hold a person's hand. But since I am blind, no one questions why :) \n\nI want to encourage you to communicate with me and to feel free to ask questions. But I want something more! I want you to try to get to know me and not just think of me as a source of information about an unusual topic. What I mean is this: many people have read my article, they tell me they liked it, they say they've never thought about a person in my situation, they thank me for writing it, but then, nothing happens. I know I won't have something in common with every person on this site, but I want to encourage you to ask not only about my situation, but to tell me about your situation. Again, I am truly grateful for the wonderful responses I have received and I look forward to getting to know more about you. I will stop for now, as my poor friend is probably getting tired of typing. \n\nWarm hugs to you all,\nBob",

    "body": "I had a friend who was gay and blind, what struck me the most is how he was fearless about going to dates from grindr. It was very hard for him to choose who to talk with on it because people rely so much on photos on this app and sometimes doesn't even write something about them in the bio. So he chatted with some guys found the one with he connected to, then send a photo and meet the guy in a metro station and wait for the guy to find him. It would always afraid me, but he never had bad situations, only some guy who never showed up, or some who didn't like the fact he was blind, because he didn't always tell in fear of immediate rejection. I helped him choose a good photo for grindr, and secretly photoshop it a little to remove a small imperfection. I always loved to be the one who guide him within a group of friends, he takes your lower arm to follow you and I would describe what I saw and tell him the cute guys I would see.\n\n He told me that the only advantage of being blind that its boyfriend could pass for its guide and take its hand and people would never say anything or give strange look compared to two sighted guys. \n\n I asked him how did he knows he was gay, and it was along the lines that he discovered he would prefer to be affectionate with men, prefer men voice and company. He was very open about it with its blind friends, and Internet and forums clearly helped him a lot. ",

    "body": "My brother was born blind and has come out as gay recently (he's 21). As other people on here have mentioned, there's much more to sexual attraction than just visual aspects. As he explained to me, in middle school and high school he just started to notice that he was more attracted to boys than girls- their deeper voices, assertiveness, and masculine scent. He also found people who were interested in \"boy\" stuff like sports, guns, video games, etc. to be more interesting and attractive than people who were into the stereotypical things females like. He actually went to a high school for the blind and was on the wrestling team there (ha yes there is such a thing) his junior and senior years. As funny as it sounds, it was there he fully discovered his affection for other males once he became physical with them on the wrestling mat. I think he was definitely \"on his way\" to becoming gay before that, so I'm not sure if that really played a factor. Also, apparently he and the wrestling coach (who was also blind) had this weird unspoken thing for each other (although my brother claims nothing ever happened between the two). The wrestling coach was also blind from birth so it'd be interesting to find out his story as well. Here is a picture of the coach circa a few years ago: http://imgur.com/gallery/R390EId",

You were never 'aware' of being straight, because you never had to think about it, it was all just normal. Your son may have had a different experience (especially with a father like you), but this is just my 2c on why \"realising you're gay\" is a thing, based on how I did.",

While planning for some things, I asked him what he did. He looked at me and said, \"you know I'm gay, right?\" The only appropriate response I could think of was, \"oh thank god you knew. I didn't wanna be the one to have to tell you!\" He's been a bit more open about it ever since, but I found it incredibly sad that he wasn't able to talk about his husband openly without feeling like people will persecute him for it. Seriously, I absolutely love my wife and could talk about her for hours. 95% of anything worth while that I do is with her.

Just looking another person in the eyes,  their expression and body language is HUGE part of the way we communicate and there's no replacing that. Blind people lack one of the major communication methods that most people use without thinking. They just have to do without it, and it certainly makes things harder.\n\nFor example, how do you know when it's okay to touch? You don't usually ask - you look at the expression. If the expression is open and encouraging, you'll take that as permission to touch. It's way clumsier without vision - plus you can't see where you're about to touch. Also, when you meet a new person you're interested in, people usually use subtle visual cues to make their interest known - a slightly longer look in the eyes than usual, smiling, other body language. These happen so naturally that people don't even think about it consciously. Ever met a person you looked in the eye and instantly knew there might be chemistry, even before either one said a word? That'll never happen to a blind person. How do you replace a quick wink and smile with purely verbal communication? That's quite efficient way to gauge the initial interest of another person before starting a conversation. \n\nI've worked in an organization that helps the blind people with computers. I don't think people really realize how much you lose with vision and how hard it is to live every day live without seeing. I certainly didn't before I actually worked with them. I'd rather lose both of my legs than both of my eyes.",

The guy had an absolutely *terrible* service dog. I mean, this dog was so friendly, it probably could have legally been kicked out of the bar. The guy actually encouraged people to pet the dog, who bit down on my hand in his excitement. He joked that the dog usually attracted young women\u2014totally useless to him!\u2014but that this time, the dog finally brought him a couple of men. The guy then handed me his business card. He does accessibility consulting. I guess we might hang out sometime.",

So to a stranger or an acquaintance, that label might be important. Maybe they never explored their sexuality in a constructive way, so they can't comprehend what another's point of view may be like. But if you get to know someone and they appreciate you for who you are, then they will understand if you can't decide on some preconceived label. You could be straight as an arrow for 50 years and suddenly fall head over heels for a man. Love works in mysterious ways my friend. If the masses need a label; fine whatever, but for the people who matter there are no labels. You don't need to be one sexuality or another because they are just imaginary human constructs; they don't really exist outside of our minds. So like who you like, forget the haters, and live it up pal. No one's getting in your way except your own self doubt. ",
