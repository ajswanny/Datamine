They put the bacon, sausage, et all in, then poured egg overtop of it. This caused the ingredients to be mixed into the egg, which made the whole omelette much more stable. That's how I've made omelettes ever since. Changed my life.\n\nEdit: To clarify. All the additions were cooked into the egg, but I then put cheese on like normal and folded the egg like one would an omelette. Yes, cooking the ingredients into the egg is more akin to a frittata, but folding the egg over the cheese like a taco is an omelette. I suppose that makes this a frittamlette.",

My uncle (not my cousin's dad), who was a chef at a very high end catering company in Washington DC, showed the girls how to make them...  Instead of flipping them in the pan, they slid them off the side of the pan onto the plate, and used the pan to flip the 2nd half over the first half.  Basically changed my life.\n\nEdit:  Today was my work from home day.  Thanks everyone for the tips!  Today was 3 eggs with chorizo sausage, ham, and spinach.

    "body": "There are enough comments now that this'll pass unseen, but, one time at a chalet my friend changed my omelette game with sriracha:\n\n\nStart with some onions and mushrooms in some oil (*with spinach as well if you enjoy it*), seasoned with salt and pepper. While that's happening, beat eggs in a separate bowl, add your favorite spices (I like chili flakes, **onion salt**, paprika and rosemary), and then add enough sriracha that the mixture turns orange. Not dark yellow; not red; orange. If you're not good with spicy - the spice gets completely cooked out of it. All you get is the taste, and the taste is amazing. \n\nProceed to pour the mixture over the evenly-spread onions and mushrooms and let it cook. Wait until you can lift a portion of the omelette and not have any liquid leftover underneath it before adding cheese evenly over the omelette and folding one half onto the other. Wait about 15 second for the cheese to melt and the middle to cook and then serve!",

Then I tasted the Waffle House one that was cooked for less time and nice and fluffy.

THEN I started making omelettes using freshly-laid eggs from my neighbor's happy chickens and I kid you not their those eggs taste a million times better cooked up. So now, I cook my freshly-laid egg omelette very briefly with a spoonful of sour cream and whatever else yummy is around and it comes out a Morning Masterpiece.

    "body": "When I was running for Class President my Senior year,  things were looking a little grim.  I really wanted the position because the administration had removed all the soda machines from the high school on account of the well to do health nuts on the school board.  As class president I would have the political clout to negotiate a compromise, maybe not get the machines back but at least get cans and bottles available at the school store.  Anything would be better than off-brand Gatorade.  \n  \nThe problem was Kelsey Macintyre, who was way more popular than me and could pull votes from both the preps and the geeks as she had that 'hot band girl' thing going on.  All I really had was the anti-social clique I sat at the lunch table with and some kids that smoked behind the industrial entrance after school.  I was working out a game plan with my Soc. teacher, Mr. Balicki, who suggested that I look into her ex-boyfriend and dig up some dirt on her, possibly get a rumor started that she was sleeping with the band director.  When I told him that I wasn't really comfortable lying about someone like that he went off the handle about American politics and how things work in the real world, that it was time for me to grow up and play ball like an adult.  I remember him saying, *'You can't make an omlette without breaking a few eggs.'*  \n  \nI was so disgusted with what he was telling me to do that I decided I wasn't going to take his advice.  Any of it.  I ran the race on soda machines and soda machines alone.  I lost by a pretty wide margin, but I've been making my omelets with unbroken eggs ever since.  ",

Eggs, cheese, salt/pepper, whateva ya like. Then you shut the ziploc and mush it up with your hands. Boil a big pot of water and put a long spoon or spatula across the top, then use a couple clotheslines to pin your ziploc to the spoon, so the egg is below the water but the ziploc isn't completely submerged. Let it boil in there for 5-7 minutes then unclog it from the spoon/spatula and take the ziploc out of the pot. Let it cool for maybe a minute then unseal the ziploc and flop your omelette out!!!!

    "body": "Just going to chime in as a chef and graduate of the French Culinary Institute, where Chef Pepin was one of the deans and heavily influenced the program. During our egg classes, we were taught to use a fork to move the egg around in the pan, even further beating it in the pan by hovering the fork in the middle while moving it in small circles and swirling the pan at the same time.  Now, while we would do that, and even folding the omelette with a fork, we were taught to contact the pan as little as possible to minimize wear.  And as soon as we had the technique down we were told to use a rubber spatula for at least the fold where you have to touch the pan (I just use one the whole way through).  In one of his live demonstrations I attended Pepin used the fork the whole way through, I asked and he said it's just habit.  In restaurant kitchens usually nonstick pans are much cheaper than the ones in the video (maybe $10 a pop) and treated as semi-disposable since even the best pans, handled as carefully as possible, will develop micro tears in the teflon with regular use and cease to be nonstick even if it looks immaculate.  So, using a fork now and then isn't a huge deal.",

    "body": "For anybody curious, but not quite curious enough to click, Julia Goddamn Child makes us all look like kids with Easy Bake Ovens in the first 30 seconds of that video.\n\n- At mark 00:01, she ladles in a scoop of eggs into a skillet. She's working on a shitty electric stove.\n\n- At mark 00:03, you can see her shadow on the work surface, and tell that she is on a shoe-string production budget that doesn't allow for adequate key and fill lights in the studio.\n\n- She works one-handed and does not use any utensils, because spatulas are apparently for losers.\n\n- The heat on that pan is up to about a million degrees, because those eggs go from liquid to foldable by mark 00:17.\n\n- Throughout, she's talking about when to serve an omelette, not how to make one.\n\n- By the 00:22 mark, she has folded her omelette just by shaking the pan with astonishing vigor and precision.\n\n- At the 00:25 mark, she has turned out an omelette into the exact center of the plate, again with no tools. Even though she apparently had the stove turned up to a temperature where most cooks would end up burning water, there is not so much as a brown mark on the damn thing.\n\nSeriously, watch the video, then go and pour out a measure of Pernod for your fallen homie.",
