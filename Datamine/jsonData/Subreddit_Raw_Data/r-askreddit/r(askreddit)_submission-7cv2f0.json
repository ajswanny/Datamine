    "body": "My time to shine.\n\nI used to work at a printing press that also duplicated/replicated discs; meaning, all of that physical inventory you see in stores like DVD's, and CD's were made by us - BUT...we were cheaper than most places, so unsigned bands were our proverbial bread and butter. I had the privilege of listening to some of the most amazing music that flew under the radar. Here's a dump of great underdogs, some were done by us, but most are just merely criminally underrated. I don't endorse any of these bands, and haven't worked at the press for nearly 5 years.\n\n\n[Brick + Mortar *Seven Years in the Mystic Room*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTj_16nI8g0) - Experimental Rock/HipHop - You might have heard their cover of Jimi Hendrix on the Hitman soundtrack, but all of their albums are fucking stunning.\n\n[RX Bandits *Gemini, Her Majesty*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzh3YBr5q9A&list=PLY944k5l1aEAGtjQb_VFuHWool6MQU4rl) - Experimental rock/ska - Insanely talented band that I've seen live without knowing who they are. They're directly connected to one of my other favorite bands listed below, The Sound of Animals Fighting which has the addition of Circa Survive/Saosin Vocalist Anthony Green.\n\n[The Sound of Animals Fighting *The Ocean and the Sun*](https://youtu.be/t3o4mI_we-w?t=42) - They get weird, real weird. But this is their last album, and probably their most normal album as their previous two had weird interludes, but the songs are fantastic on all three albums. Insanely underrated band.\n\n[Midlake *The Courage of Others*](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL966A18A46DF49050) - Stoner folk/reminiscent to Fleet Foxes but with more somber toned vocals. Just fucking listen to this goddamn album, it's beautiful.\n\n [IllScarlett *All Day With It*](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL115D5B0EB29637DA) - Stoner Ska, but a very talented Canadian band. Catchy tunes, and I realllllly fucking wish I could locate my physical copy of this album as it's difficult to find their tunes on YT.\n\n[The Mountain Goats *Tallahassee*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rwLkEpxSC0&list=PL68EF2BAA7E6782C4) - Gut wrenching and beautiful lyrics. Folk music.\n\n[MeWithoutYou *Catch For Us the Foxes*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDKlKOP6fDI) - Drop what you're doing, and listen to this goddamn album while reading each and every gorgeous lyric. Seriously has one of the best lyricists of the past few decades, the dude is a goddamn marvel that has some serious anguish in his voice.\n\n[Levi Weaver *The Letters of Dr. Kurt G\u00f6del*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5NgHvDebZo) Insanely talented folk/experimental musician, and sensational songwriter. I wish I could find more of his music, but this is one of the songs from that album. [He also does a kickass cover of Radiohead's *Idioteque*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VA8-NX_LW7A)\n\n[Authority Zero *A Passage in Time*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPH9NGNviO0) Ska/Rock Just a great fucking album, and makes me think of Tony Hawk Pro Skater.\n\n[Reid Willis *Born of Kaleidoscope*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhx2gseZNxI) - Ambient/Electronic This album is fantastic, as is all his work, but his music is also difficult to track down.\n\n[Patrick Sweany *Every Hour is a Dollar Gone*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqTFga1IOjY&list=PLL04X9v_QXgE820r1Y89JkLL-oFWqv3Ij) - Rock and Roll/Blues. This dude has passion, and is incredibly talented, but sadly doesn't get noticed frequently. This album was produced by Dan Auerbach from The Black Keys.\n\n[Pegasus Dream *In Abesntia*](https://soundcloud.com/pegasusdream/sets/rootmusic-bandpage-1) - Practically no views, very few listens, this is basically underground and I can't figure out why as it's a very well done dream-pop album. I hate pop...Why the fuck do I love this album...\n\n[Walking Oceans *Dear Isaac*](https://soundcloud.com/terrence-vitali/sets/walking-oceans-dear-isaac) Ambient instrumental - Incredibly well put together music, with virtually no views on sound cloud. I had this album on nonstop repeat at my desk for the entire duration of their project. On par with Explosions in the Sky, in my opinion.\n\n[Radiation 4 *Wonderland*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccHNTriMSrE&list=PL851BD6D1D5E73A79) Experimental metal/math metal/circus metal - I don't even know where to begin. If you enjoy metal music, give this album a shot, it's ridiculously amazing. It seems they've taken influence from Mr. Bungle, and Sleepytime Gorilla Museum, but seem to be a bit more grounded (emphasis on \"a bit\"). Vocalist likes to use sound effects on his voice occasionally, which works very well with the circus vibe of their sound.\n\n[Ellen Sundberg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XmOeJy6RmE) - Country/folk rock - I think my guitar mentor actually produced this album, which is the only reason why I know of her because I think she's from Iceland or something, but she's damn good. I really dislike country, but she leans more towards folk and has just the right amount of twang.\n\n[Keaton Henson *Dear*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P02L2geOMGc) Actually reminds me a bit of Scout Niblett, and I'm not sure why. Just a dude and his guitar, very soft-spoken, and heartbroken. \n\n[Sorne](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izb7R04_Heg) - Have no idea how to explain this dude. He's got really cool music videos, and his music is pretty amazing, but I can't categorize it's genre for the life of me. I jam to this song very frequently, and always watch the video in its entirety.\n\n[Black Books](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mh69anIXeGE) - Sound very reminiscent to Band of Horses. This is my favorite song of theirs, but this video absolutely rips my heart out of my chest.\n\n[Polica](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iz3WUEl_qHk) - Two drummers, a bassist, and a vocalist with a beautiful voice that uses  effects. Fairly poppy, but she's got some great lyrics, and the entire album of *Give You the Ghost* is fantastic. [Wandering Star](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yX4iIPlwS5c) is my favorite song by them, and the video is fantastic.\n\n[Joanna Newsom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDQIGraR3aI) Lovely voice, if not quirky, and plays harp beautifully. She's also married to Andy Samberg\n\n[Jesse Stewart](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEvQOPUHGH8) Dude with a mandolin plays his heart out, but really love every one of his songs. He's a bit unorthodox, but he's got sincere passion in every one of his songs.\n\n[Hyro Da Hero](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CE4hdJphnao) - Hip hop/rap they're all cookie cutter IMO, that rely on a typical beat. Not this dude. I believe the band members, or at least one(?), are from the hardcore group *The Blood Brothers*. Not huge on rap, but I really dig this guy, and the music packs a fucking punch.\n\n[The Claypool Lennon Delirium](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCpJUyAibew) - Les Claypool of *Primus* and John Lennon's son Sean Lennon. Good god this album is good, but very kooky which is to be expected because Les Claypool is an absolute nut.\n\n[Sunny Day Real Estate *How it Feels to be Something On*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcdghI0e7S0&t=1535s) - Incredible indie band from my childhood that doesn't get the recognition they deserve.\n\n[The Appleseed Cast *Two Conversations*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7U0bllvJUyQ&t=1085s) - Amazing indie band with conservative use of vocals, but the music is stellar.\n\n[Megafauna *Maximalist*](https://soundcloud.com/megafauna/sets/maximalist) Fantastic rock and roll. The old physical CD I had of theirs broke, and these soundcloud tracks seem to have been re-recorded/remastered as a few of my favorite tracks are missing, and it sounds completely different. \n\n[COLOUR REVOLT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQqB4ri5_5c&list=PLXp4edtig0vSgJE6R5Vf8Tj5ELt_Yw6V8) - Rock/Indie Rock - They have 3 albums, and they're all incredible. Easily one of my favorite bands of all time, but are criminally underrated. The lead vocalist put out a very chill album under a different name listed below, and it's so goddamn good.\n\n[El Obo *Oxford Basement Collection*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSZm6DBXkTU) Vocalist Jesse Coppenbarger for Colour Revolt released this experimental acoustic album. There are some serious Flaming Lips vibes on a few tracks. Incredible.\n\n[Mad Gregs *Relatives*](https://soundcloud.com/mad-gregs-band) This album is an organized clusterfuck that is beautifully executed. When four talented multi-instrumentalists get together with a classical background, beautiful things happen. Heavy jazz influences, with some 80's pop undertones, experimental, and somehow has a Flaming Lips vibe in some areas, so they're probably the 2nd most polarizing on this list (next to Radiation 4). I'd start with track 8 - [Holiday Pearl](https://soundcloud.com/mad-gregs-band/08-holiday-pearl-1) which is just fantastic.\n\n[Dr. Dog *Fate*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jgaj0LHnJXE) Probably the closes we're going to get to The Beatles during this generation, and they have multiple singers just like the Beatles as well. Great album with incredibly talented musicians. Old school rock and roll from young musicians. [Here's their Tiny Desk Concert starter pack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzmvzcDWZjI) in case you're uncertain whether you want to dive into their extensive discography.\n\n[Dinosaur Jr. *Farm*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EfSo840sTmI&list=PLFgtLCsn09X3qCEKh9SuPdE4xChLwUKlJ) Rock and Roll. Great album with great musicians. This band and Dr. Dog are what I refer to as \"commercial underground\". They're signed, but don't get the recognition they deserve. ",

It's soothing and disrupting at once, and in a way I think it's the perfect 21st century album. Dan Bejar's probably best known as a member of The New Pornographers, but this project (which has been going on a *long* time) is where he shines. \n\nAlso *Album* by Girls. It's twee and naive and catchy in a Beach Boys way and makes me think of the best summer of my life, so maybe it's just me. ",

    "body": "Here is a list of the albums that when I first heard them, I just couldn't stop listening to them. Many of these I listened on repeat for weeks or even months. I really like listening to new music so this list might get long :P . I know some of these are not \"obscure\" but I want to give people the chance to hear a band they might not listen to in their normal circles.\n\n\n**Major Parkinson - Twilight cinema** \n\n[Impermanence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb3EiIvSjqI)\n\nAn Experimental Rock group from Norway, it's hard kinda hard to describe their sound but it reminds me of [Over the Garden Wall](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAQZB98wewY) or like a nightmare about gypsies idk. If you like them check out...\n\n\n\n[Woodkid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSkb0kDacjs)\n\n[The Dear Hunter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZPLsrOzLew) (one of my all time favorite bands who deserve a spot of their own so...)\n\n\n\n**The Dear Hunter - Acts I/II/III/IV/V**\n\n[Acts I-V](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5eGNWtS-WM)\n\nIMHO one of the greatest bands of our time. The Acts tell the story of a boy born to single mother in the 1890's. The songs go from his birth to his struggles with the corrupt priest that runs the town, to his time in WW1, to his falling in love, etc. A masterpiece.\n\n\n\n**Brick & Mortar - Bangs**\n\n[Locked in a cage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfrPU0Gk5r0)\n\nAn indie rock duo from New Jersey. One of my top 5 bands. Bangs is their best album by far. If you like them, the closest band i found to them is [IAMDYNAMITE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76anRLvSKHA) they changed their sound pretty drastically after their first album so don't really listen to their new stuff.\n\n\n\n**Fleshgod Apocalypse - King**\n\n[Full Album](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ9nd7zm1MA&list=PL0dXFUZ_pE3NzHRg2c_jCvPF9r2oEN0Zq)\n\nA Symphonic Death Metal band from Italy. If you don't like growls and guttural vocals this isn't for you. Fleshgod Apocalypse is a death metal band with heavy influences from classical and opera and they merge the very different genres beautifully. (new link, thank you u/asirr)\n\n\n\n**The Moon Runners - Starblanket**\n\n[Starblanket](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4R1jfMV8io)\n\nHere's one i guarantee no here has heard, as i am the only like on their youtube video :P A really good album even though they quite literally unheard of and one I listened to on repeat for like a month straight when it came out. They are on spotify too so give 'em a follow <3\n\n\n\n**Pallbearer - Foundations of Burden**\n\n[Full Album](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N99KPZ2RsoM)\n\nA doom metal band from Arkansas with very clean vocals and amazing instrumentals. Foundations of Burden is probably their best album. As with all doom metal, they have a very depressing sound. I listen to this album on repeat as I read Dracula for the first time and made it all the better.\nIf you like them check out...\n\n[Khemmis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MQfTawVLeI&t=)\n\n\n**Blind Guardian - Beyond the Red Mirror**\n\n[The Ninth Wave](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Px8WHr73wZw)\n\n[Twilight of the Gods](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CteS9v9sK3E)\n\n[The Throne](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsBezDU8C_Q)\n\nA Powermetal band from Germany. A band with one of the most epic sounds I've personally aver heard. I'm a huge fan of *beyond the red mirror* but a friend of mine says [A Night at the Opera](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UWeeV7N3vDM&list=PL_tuzEfnISdJB8-sXjgu6F2XsJNdKuMw3) is his favorite album.\n\n**Shearwater - Animal Joy**\n\n[Full Album](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLVNOnFFvXo)\n\nAn Indie Rock band from Texas. A very chill band and a nice change of pace after all that metal. Very relaxing and their following album [Jet Plane and Oxbow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ButIZ6xAP2M) is equally as good.\n\n\n\n**Gunship - Gunship**\n\n[Tech Noir](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nC5TBv3sfU) \n\nA Synthwave band from Britain. An Amazing band that takes Synthwave where no other band in the genre has before. If you are unfamiliar with with the Genre, its like a pseudo-80's electronic thing. It will remind you of things like Tron, Blade Runner, Etc. If you have been really into Stranger Things this might tide you over for awhile. If you like them check out...\n\n\n[Dance with the Dead](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4E4kjQIw6M&t=)\n\n[Perturbator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Vsf3zYppP4)\n\n[Mitch Murder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hugowO0sSrM)\n\nAnd by popular demand; [Carpenter Brut](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DY1s9SmrQRE)\n\n\n\n\n**The Protomen - Act II - The Father of Death**\n\n\n[Breaking Out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMrFiOjxk5s)\n\n[Light Up the Night](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkLvpt9Z3fA)\n \n\n**Dry the River - Shallow Bed**\n\n[New Ceremony](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCJ22QQTWtM)\n\nAn Alternative Rock band from London. A very relaxing band, they even have an acoustic version of the above album that rivals the original. \n\n\n\n**Grimes - Visions**\n\n[Genesis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FH-q0I1fJY)\n\nAn adorable Electropop solo artist from Vancouver. Here stuff is a little weird if this isn't your style of music, but I found it very catchy and couldn't stop listening to it when it first came out.\n\n\n\n**Hozier - Hozier**\n\n[Take Me To Church](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVjiKRfKpPI)\n\n[Angel of Small Death...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bmp4QWzHak)\n\nA singer songwriter from Ireland. He is getting pretty popular with his song *Take Me To Church*, but the whole album is amazing and if you like that song, give the rest of the album a listen.\n\n\n\n**The Kin - Get On It**\n\n[Get On It](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHQw1pbdKPE)\n\nA short EP but a really good one. I would have put my favorite song by them; *Boy you're a pretty girl* but I don't think they have a studio version on Youtube. \n\n\n\n**Ratatat - Classics**\n\n[Loud Pipes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64liF2VuLxI)\n\nAn Electronic Duo from Brooklyn. They are completely instrumental and have unique sound that is unmistakable. They performed with Kid Cudi on two of his songs, most notably [Pursuit of Happiness](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq_uy1qcO-k)\n\n\nJesus this list is getting out of hand. I could go on forever but I should probably stop here. If anyone has any questions or wants to share a band with me feel free.\n\n\n-Edit-\n\n\n\n**A Silent Film - Sand & Snow**\n\n[Harbour Lights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_2lTxtxi7U)\n\nA really good album that takes me back to highschool and innocent, young love :')\n\n\n**X Ambassadors - Love songs Drug Songs**\n\n[Love Songs Drug Songs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtRynSVzpMM)\n\nThe next Imagine Dragons. Enjoy them while you can, I swear you'll here them everywhere in a few years and it will annoy the hell out of you.\n\n\n\n**Half Moon Run - Dark Eyes**\n\n[Full Album](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIYOxxz9YFg)\n\n[Call Me In The Afternoon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_yengUrkaU)\n\n\n**Active Child - You Are All I See**\n\n[Johhny Belinda](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9SNJC3YcTQ)\n\nSuper chill singer songwriter.\n\n\n**Alex Clare - The Lateness of the Hour**\n\n\n[Up All Night](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAlU5xqU6fQ)\n\n\nA solid album with great songs like [Hummingbird](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5Jr4xIc-Zs)\nand [Too Close](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zP50Ewh31E4)\n\n**The Birthday Massacre - Walking With Strangers**\n\n[Full album](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9B8VVH4Uro)\n\n[Science](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IrQ1vq_Osaw)\n\nAn Electric/Dark Wave band from Ontario. Great for when you want to feel like and angsty emo 13 year old. I still love them though.\n\n\n**Baroness - Yellow and Green**\n\n[March to the Sea](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxNYP-OaPhE)\n\n[Take My Bones Away](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZKPpeuHvJk)\n\n \n\n\n**Chet Faker - Built On Glass**\n\n[Gold](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hi4pzKvuEQM)\n\nAn Australian Singer Songwriter. He does an amazing cover of *No Diggity*, [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPSZp_rOXHg) is his live session of it.\n\n\n\n**TV on the radio - Return to Cookie Mountain**\n\n[Wolf Like Me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1-xRk6llh4)\n\nIndie Rock band from Brooklyn.\n\n\n\n**Some individual songs I've been playing on repeat lately:**\n\n[Ocean Man](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6E5m_XtCX3c) by Ween\n\n[Ocean Power](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7tBKp4S7aU) Because of course\n\n\n[Space Song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBtlPT23PTM) by Beach House\n\n\n[First](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_mmnFtiB48) by Cold War Kids\n\n\n[Into The Wild](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRtWInxI1pg) by LP\n\n\n[The Wreck of S.S. Needle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wz-4xELUpMs) by Cult Of Luna Ft. Julie Christmas\n\n\n[Source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RHFFeQ2tu4) by Fever the Ghost, Video by the amazing Felix Colgrave\n\n\n-Edit- I wanted to add my absolute favorite albums to here, so here\n\n\n**The Antlers - Burst Apart**\n\n[Full Album](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nMWXvRJc5c&t=)\n\nI know Hospice is their more popular album but I prefer this one idk why. \n\n\n**Sonata Arctica - Winterheart's Guild/Ecliptica**\n\n[Winterheart's Guild](https://youtu.be/ek7jUrVK04w)\n\n[Ecliptica](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7oOWO6xT3Y)\n\nSonata is my all time favorite band and these are two best albums. Ecliptica is their most famous and contains the song [Fullmoon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfI8o_hzaDk) which is their most famous song.\n\n\n**Stratovarius - Nemesis**\n\n[Nemesis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GatqruHJPWk&t=)\n\nMaybe not their most famous album as its a more recent one, but in my opinion their new stuff is actually better. chech out *unbreakable* on this album.\n\n\n-Edit- \n\nfor those of you who like doom metal here is bell witches new album that is composed of a single, 83 minute song\n\n[Mirror Reaper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10q1ZJyLXFk) \n\nnot my favorite album but its fun to listen to for the novelty of it.",

He makes some very, very good music.\n\nI heard his song Lionheart in like 2009, and I listened to it on repeat for like a week. I've since listened to most of his music, and he's got a talent for beautiful, down tempo, nice to listen to music.\n\nIf anyone hasn't heard of him, start with this album and Soon It Will Be Cold Enough. I'd describe him as mostly instrumental, down tempo (but not boring) hip-hop jazz. If you like music from Bonobo, Nujabes (who was actually Emancipators mentor), etc, you'll like Emancipator.\n\nQuick story about Douglas Appling himself...I was making a presentation for a project at school, and wanted to use his music as background noise. I emailed him to get permission, not expecting an answer and expecting to just use 30 second clips of his songs...but he emailed back the same day, thanked me for listening to his music, and said I could absolutely use his music. He just asked I put a credit in the presentation somewhere. \n\nI love Emancipator, sorry if this got a little long. I'm just excited to see him in the thread :)",

I had just gotten past the worst 2 years of my life, including an awful conclusion to an abusive relationship. I heard the band mentioned on some local indie radio station but only caught the last half of the track. The DJ mentioned how much she loved that album but couldn't listen to it anymore. For whatever reason I decided to go home and listen to it myself.\n\nIt was a cold friday night and it had been a long week. I was mentally drained and had a bit to drink. I sat and put the album on intending to just check it out before I went out later that evening.\n\nI sat and listened to it from start to finish. Then I listened to it all the way through again. It leveled me. I've only had that reaction a handful of times. It hit exactly where I needed it to. Someone else had been through what I had been through. Someone else had managed to put into words the feeling of hopelessness, emptiness, and helplessness that being in that situation brings. Knowing that you can't help someone that doesn't want to be helped. The feeling that no matter what you feel for someone, you can't make them feel the same things back for you. Trying your hardest to help someone only to watch them fail themselves and fail you in the same process. I had never had something resonate so strongly or summarize my state so eloquently. It was incredible. I love that album.\n\nI can't listen to it often, and when I do, I will only listen to it beginning to end. It is devastating and it hurts but it is incredible at the same time. I can't speak more highly of that record.",

Dj Rum - Mountains EP It's in the Burial-esq downtempo bass music genre.  I think the two songs Mountains Pt1 and Mountains Pt 2 & 3 are perfect together.  It's very simple downtempo, but every time I listen to it I hear something new.  You discover the depths of the music the more and more you listen.\n\nAnd I think it qualifies for pretty unknown since the whole EP isn't even on youtube!\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUg6eJZEWwk&list=PL5030E3229BC0428E",

Its about that deep, painful melancholic feeling when you lament the loss of a loved one and regret the past. It has some intense, heavy themes and it hits hard.

During the performance the whole band leaves the stage except her on the nights that she's there, and you can tell he is just pouring his soul out to her. It is one of the most intimate things I've ever seen and probably one of the clearest ways I've ever observed true love.  \n  \n[Here's a good quality clip of it if you're interested.](https://youtu.be/jm6GXnV7c6E?t=1h6m46s)",
