And, lately, we've been kind of sick of each other.  \n\nDad seems to take his frustration over being unemployed and disabled since his stroke out on us, acts like a stubborn child.  I can't tell whether its out of spite or actual senility.  \n\nMy brother has depression and bipolar, and is unemployed of course.  If he's not at his out-patient therapy program, he's home sleeping most of the day.  I can hear him snoring right now.\n\nI'm pretty much their caretaker.  I go to work, I come home and cook and clean.  I find distractions to keep my anger at them in check.\n\nWhen holidays come around, it gets harder and harder to care every year.  Traditions and customs erode away.  We stopped decorating the house.  We stopped decorating the pre-lit tree.  I stick a couple gifts in a single box for each of us and wrap it.  I still make a nice Christmas dinner, but this year I'm not dragging out the good china or flatware.  Who are we trying to impress?\n\nAround the holidays you seek out friends and family and celebrate being together.  \n\nMy family is growing tired of pretending to still be one.",

    "body": "Keeping madness and misery at bay for myself and hopefully my son. Thank you, the entirety of Reddit, for keeping my attention from going where it wants.   \n\nEarlier this year my wife was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. She\u2019s 45 and the mother of our seven-year-old. She\u2019s handling her current chemo regime fairly well, but it\u2019s rare for her to be up much past eight these days. Our little man in a natural night owl, and with all the impending excitement and evening activities (writing a Santa\u2019s letter, baking and arranging the plate of cookies and carrots, etc.) has only recently begun lightly snoring.  \n\nAll this should be a scene to make even Rockwell wince at the saccharinity of it all. Our whole life together has been that way, really. Work from home, happily spend 24 hours a day together, five or six classic multi-hour road-trip family vacations every summer to music festivals (for an idea of the whimsy in that vein our van is covered in chalkboard paint), huge flower gardens and happy cats. Yeah, life was good. \n\nIt\u2019s things like this \u2014 things we used to do together \u2014 that are among the hardest. Empty sounds reminding me of what\u2019s going on. It\u2019s a struggle to keep an aura of bliss around the Little Man. Besides arranging the presents and eating the cookies, there\u2019s something that I didn\u2019t expect to be so daunting: writing Santa\u2019s note.  \n\nThe note itself isn\u2019t the problem per se; I write him lots of notes. That\u2019s just it. A year and a half ago I got into the habit of sending him to school with a note that\u2019s half fatherly love and half story ([it turned into a pretty epic event for him](https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/4ojywb/for_10_months_ive_been_setting_up_a_pretty_epic/)). And so he\u2019s intimately familiar with my handwriting.  \n\nWhich is why I\u2019m browsing Reddit and not getting on with it. Actually, physically writing it means trying to change up my handwriting pretty drastically. Doing that instead of handing her the draft to write in a strange hand and flourish. I need her. We\u2019re a team. Sometimes doing things on my own sneaks up on me. \n\nSo I put it off for a little longer. Write this. Read some more posts. Avoid looking directly at it.  \n\nThank you for listening.  \n",

In one of her enraged outbursts, she told me not to bother coming home again if I \"continued to act in this sick-minded way.\" No amount of reasoning or discussion got through to her; she doesn't seem to care what I want to do with my life, let alone recognize that I have a say in the matter.\n\nOver the past year, my mom would periodically enter these manic states lasting 2-3 days in which she would nag me by texting and calling literally multiple times per day to apply to programs. She would \"threaten\" to visit me in my city. She would also try to leverage my dad's death last December, saying that if I didn't get a PhD like he did, I would disappoint him and my other ancestors. This happens not to agree with my current world view, but again, my world view doesn't matter to her.\n\nTo find peace from the nuisance of her remote bullying, I ended up lying by omission that I was accepted into a PhD program this fall in the city I currently live in. This stopped the nagging, but her voice telling me not to visit again stuck with me. And this is our first Christmas without my dad. He was mellow, positive, and supportive, and the bitter cynic in me sees his absence as one fewer reason to bother visiting.\n\n**EDIT:** I didn't expect this rant to blow up and am overwhelmed with the outpouring of support. Thank you all for sharing your own perspectives and offering constructive suggestions.\n\n**EDIT 2:** Unfortunately, a single reddit gold isn't nearly enough to satisfy my Asian mother's high expectations.

Had to struggle from then to get anywhere, but as soon as I got mildly successful they wanted to see me again. I had some serious stress earlier this year with nearly losing my job and as soon as my mum found out, she started telling me that her problems are worse. She kept demanding that I help her while I was struggling with my own life. Fuck that, stopped answering calls, she even called the HR department of my job to make me call her. Not joking. I've since changed jobs, moved and she knows of neither. I will bring her back, I just need time and space for a bit from that.\n\nMy parents are divorced and my dad's new family are really outgoing people and constantly take the piss out of me for being too insular. It's like they've never seen an introvert before. It makes an uncomfortable experience all the worse. I've stopped going and stopped speaking to them. They've not tried reaching out to me and I've not tried reaching out to them. The feeling seems mutual there.\n\nAll in all, after years of putting up with the above, I've decided that this year is my chance to do my own thing. I'm just enjoying my time off. Some games, some food, some music and I'll see some friends on Boxing Day. This actually feels like the best Christmas in years already. ",

Wife's dad isn't coming, he is going to his girlfriend's sister's house 30 minutes away from us but told my wife he doesn't like travelling for the holidays.  She resents the fact that my family drove 6 hours to be with us.  She is so mad at the situation that they can't stay here (not that we really have room..) and are in a hotel.  \n\nIt's a loveless marriage.  After my family left we did Santa shit in absolute silence.  We started the conversation this week about staying together for the kids or cutting ties now.  Unfortunately I don't think it is financially viable for us to split.  Too much debt, not enough income.\n\nI'm an alcoholic.  It gets me through.  Along with Reddit and video games it makes life bearable.  More of a binge drinker, I guess.  A six-pack after everybody is asleep 3-4 times a week.\n\nMy wife is diagnosed OCD with a wicked anxiety problem.  She has to run her life based off a to do list, that is mostly made up on the fly.  If she is awake she is cramming as many tasks as possible into the day, to the point of driving herself to exaustion.  I am not allowed to help with the to do list because I don't ever do anything on the to-do list the right way.  Then, after she is at the end of her rope for the day I get blamed for not helping with the things I'm not allowed to do.  I was not able to participate in any of the Christmas things.  I bought no gifts, did not decorate the tree or house.  Did not go shopping or take the kids to see Santa.  \n\nShe is also either the most pessimistic individual ever or depressed herself.  Everyday is the worst day ever and tomorrow will always be worse.  \n\nIt's been 16 years and I no longer have the energy or drive to make it work.  I cannot bring myself to care a single iota about her day, hardships or problems.  I work later and later in hopes of her being asleep by the time I get home.  \n\nIt's Christmas, my family is in town and my kids got some awesome shit from Santa.  Dinner tomorrow will be awesome and should be a hell of a good time.  And when everybody leaves the awkward silence and resentful comments will resume.  \n\nMerry Christmas Redditors.

It is a welcome but ultimately unimportant Jewish holiday, when compared to Passover (remembering and celebrating the exodus), Rosh Hashana (Jewish new year), and Yom Kippur (day of atonement, holiest day of the year), among others.\n\nIn the USA especially, its perceived importance is bolstered by its proximity to Christmas, as it's basically seen as the equivalent holiday for Jewish kids. In terms of actual tradition, the more comparable holiday is probably Purim, but that isn't widely celebrated outside of Orthodox or more religious circles. I don't even remember when it falls, but it's in the Spring or Summer I believe.\n\nFrom Wikipedia \u2014\n\n>Many people define major Jewish holidays as those that feature traditional holiday meals, kiddush, holiday candle-lighting, etc., and when all forms of work are forbidden. Only biblical holidays fit these criteria, and Chanukah was instituted some two centuries after the Bible was completed and canonized. Nevertheless, though Chanukah is of rabbinic origin, it is traditionally celebrated in a major and very public fashion. The requirement to position the menorah, or Chanukiah, at the door or window, symbolizes the desire to give the Chanukah miracle a high-profile.",

    "body": "Born in a small unincorporated township about 30 minutes outside of a city /u/AtomicPoppingTart was part of a generation of children raised being told \"you can be anything!\" in school. From potato farmer to president, if you could dream it you could become it. Coming from teachers and loved ones, any child would believe that the possibilities were truly limitless.\n\nThis posed a problem to a young /u/AtomicPoppingTart, one that showed itself in the form of a simple question. \"What do you want to be when you grow up?\" For all the other 4th graders that wanted to be doctors, policemen, and the like it was an easy assignment. For their first \"big assignment\" it almost seemed like a whole month was too much time. Not for /u/AtomicPoppingTart though. How was such a young mind to sort through the infinite possibilities every teacher speaks of!\n\nThe answer came during a family road trip the week before it was due. Thanks to a somewhat dubious map /u/AtomicPoppingTart's father had bought, they had gotten lost and subsequently broken down in the middle of nowhere late at night. Hearing that it would be several hours before help arrived, /u/AtomicPoppingTart did what any reasonable child does. Immediately begin moaning about how unfair life was. \n\n\"Listen,\" the beleaguered father interjected \"instead of complaining why don't you make the best of it and go look at the stars or something.\" Since it seemed like there was little else to do, /u/AtomicPoppingTart assented and decided to get out of the car. For the first time in /u/AtomicPoppingTart's 10 years of existence the word infinite truly held meaning. Having always been in the shadow of the city's light /u/AtomicPoppingTart had never seen the sky as it truly was. Stars beyond number, and the sky more beautiful and radiant that it ever was during the day. This moment was etched into /u/AtomicPoppingTart's very soul as the answer to that simple question.\n\n\"Yes very good Ashley, being a painter is a lovely job!\" the teacher lightly applauded as a young girl sat down. \"Now who's up next... Oh, /u/AtomicPoppingTart it's your turn!\"\n\nSlowly /u/AtomicPoppingTart stood up with a sheet of wide ruled paper and began to speak \" I want to be a scientist who studies and names all of the stars in the sky. There are so so many of them and even though some of them have names I don't think they all have names yet. It would be really nice to have a job where i got to stay up late and be able to go out and look at them and give them names. I think a name like Steve would be good but I'd have to be sure it was a really nice star first cause it would be bad if I named one Steve and then I saw another one that would be a better Steve than the first star. I read about how astronauts at NASA need people that study stuff like stars and planets and...\"\n\n\"Thank you /u/AtomicPoppingTart that's enough for now.\" The teacher cut in. The words were sweet but sharp, like a half-eaten candy cane pricking the tongue. \"I'm sure you tried to work hard on it, so we'll talk about your report during recess. Alright then, next up is...\"\n\n/u/AtomicPoppingTart was perplexed. What was wrong with wanting to look at the stars? Wasn't finding something you wanted to do with the rest of your life the whole point of the report? The rest of the class was spent being filled with ever increasing confusion and worry.\n\nCome recess the teacher sat /u/AtomicPoppingTart and began to explain how this was the 4th grade now and that wasn't a 4th grade report. The point of the report was about finding a job that you could really be and then later in the year write a report about what you learned in class that would help you become one. \"Now, /u/AtomicPoppingTart I know that I explained to everyone at the beginning of the year that you had to find a real job that you could do. I know you're a bright child however it seems like you didn't understand the assignment.\"\n\n\"But I did understand!\" the indignant /u/AtomicPoppingTart shouted, \"Studying stars is a real job and if I work real hard I could be a scientist at NASA and name stars I find!\"\n\nThen, with a sorrowful, pitying look, the teacher unleashed a crushing truth about how the world would be for /u/AtomicPoppingTart \"Calm down sweetie, I know it's a real job. But you have to understand, little girls aren't meant to grow up to work as scientists.\"",

The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call darkness. You\u2019re fucking lit, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can power you in over seven hundred thousand volts, and that\u2019s just with my bare hands.

So, they come to see me...at the movies.\n\nEdit: Holy hell, I made this post as a bit of a joke while I was taking a break at work earlier and now I have a couple dozen messages and I've gotten my first ever gold. Thank you Internet friends!\n\nI'm going to follow this up with a bit of an explanation. I'm actually off Christmas day but I had to work Thanksgiving and I was the closing manager tonight, which was Christmas Eve. Our management team all filled out thesee shift charts and I put all of my top picks as Christmas day so that I could at least have one full day with my family instead of a few partial days. Also, I had to work both Christmas and Christmas Eve last year at my old job, so I preferred not to do that again.\n\nThat being said, I really appreciate all the thanks as, even though I get Christmas, I still lost two important days with my family this holiday season. Not only that, but I know many of the people who don't have tomorrow off would really appreciate seeing so much gratitude for their time. So, my plan is to block out usernames and show the crew these replies and how much their work means to people during our holiday party at the beginning of January.\n\nOn a personal note, I've had it a bit rough over the past few months due to some family troubles. On top of that, my fianc\u00e9e is currently in another state visiting her family for Christmas, so I won't be seeing her. All of the things you guys said brightened me up and I really appeciate that, thank you. \n\nI hope you all have a Merry Christmas and, if you're not the Christmas type, that you have a nice weeked and a happy New Year!\n",
