Almost every single time, we met at the Times Square Olive Garden. Honestly.. salad and breadsticks aren't bad. (Though there were a million other restaurants I'd rather have eaten as a 15-18 year old). ",

We tried to tip the wait staff, they wouldnt accept it. Honestly it was fucking amazing. You would be working 12, 14, 18 hour shifts and you could go here, eat and relax. Ill never forget the hospitality we received....Unfortunately, for that same reason, I have never been able to  return...\n\nI tried once. Walked in with the family. looked around and couldnt get the sight of Fireman, Cops and construction works from Ground Zero all sitting around with our heads down. As great of an experience as it was, there will always be an overwhelming connection of sadness attached to it. \n\nIf you worked there during that time, and you happen to be reading this, really from the bottom of my heart, Thank You. \n\nEDIT...Wow....After typing this out, I went to take a shower, and check on my daughter. came back and my inbox was overflowing...Thank you so much everyone for the kind messages and the Reddit Gold. Honestly it was a very...interesting...time to be in NYC. The overwhelming amount of love and support was like nothing I have ever experienced before. Thank you guys again. So much thank you. \n\nEDIT 2...For those asking, I have no proof. This was 16 years ago. Olive Garden wasnt the only business to do stuff like this. Most major hotels in the area opened their cafeterias to us and a few had rooms on standby for cops and fireman. Most notable was Bloombergs Office had a whole floor that we used.\n\nEDIT 3...Just woke and I am completely blown away by the support you guys and gals have shown. I wish I could respond to each and everyone of you, Ill get to it in time, but I have a 20 month yr old daughter who I'm currently home. And to everyone who is saying the story is Bullshit because of the distance from Ground Zero to Times Square, they werent proving meals to just works on Ground Zero....ALL EMERGENCY SERVICE workers. And you also have to realize that Police were \"Flown\" in, as it were from all over NYC...Bronx, Queens, Staten Island and Brooklyn, every day. \n\nEDIT 4....For people who continue to ask for proof...This was 16 years ago, there were no Camera Phones, no Social Media, no Twitter, no way to share information. However [U/Akira1364](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/6nod61/redditors_who_have_eaten_at_the_times_square/dkbm2lv/?context=3) did in fact dig up a medical journal from 2005 that mentions Olive Garden. How this user found this, is beyond me. But its really awesome he did. The Journal is [Here](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1553-2712.2005.tb01474.x/pdf) With the relvant passage being..\"So that\u2019s what we decided to do. My husband, Marty, bought tickets at the half-price booth in Times Square. It felt odd\nattending a musical comedy\u2013\u2018\u2018The Full Monty,\u2019\u2019 no less\u2013nine days after the worst tragedy in the city\u2019s history. But if that\u2019s\nwhat Rudy wanted us to do then that\u2019s what we would do. For dinner, we walked across the street to the three-story Olive\nGarden restaurant. The place was surprisingly busy. The Olive Garden had reserved the first floor for rescue workers.\nVolunteers from all over the country had come to help at Ground Zero. By day nine, however, there was no one left to rescue,\nno one alive emerging from the mounds of smoldering rubble.\".....This passage took place 09/20/01\n\n\n\n",

We did this a few times, often pretending that we were highfalutin businessmen (because that's where a 14-year old thinks hedge fund workers go to eat, apparently), and we would say things like \"BUSINESS!\" and \"Stocks are down\" and \"Tom from payroll did blow off a hooker's back!\" to each other--again, what business people do.\n\nOne Saturday, I had no plans (naturally) so I thought I'd call my friend to set up another business lunch at the OG. When he didn't answer my calls or texts, I thought I'd just head to Times Square and assume he'd confirm our appointment by the time I arrived. Once I arrived and I still heard nothing, I thought \"well, I've come this far\" and had a meal myself. I'll never forget the look of pity the host had for me when I sauntered up and said \"table for one,\" as cheerfully as I could.\n\nSo there I was, 14 years old, eating alone at the Times Square Olive Garden, [wearing this t-shirt](https://gullprint.com/pub/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/1000x1240/e9c3970ab036de70892d86c6d221abfe/t/r/trololo-k.jpg) that was about 2 sizes too big for me. The waiter, making conversation with me out of pity, asked if the shirt was political. I explained the Trololo meme as best I could, while he pretended to understand. He gave me the cringiest smile and walked away.\n\n\nI haven't been back in about 6 years or so, but sometimes I wonder if the walls still reek of loneliness.",

    "body": "Literally ate there yesterday.... it's super weird to see this post.\n\nThe best I can say is desperation. My girlfriend and I had never been to New York before so we spent the whole day seeing the city. Skipped lunch, so by 9:30 when we walked by it we were starving. The smell lured us in and... there you go.\n\nI think the other part of it was due to our lack of experience in New York. My girlfriend and I have never been to New York, don't know anything about New York, and were alone without someone who knows anything about eating in New York. Given that, we had no idea how to pick between the million hole-in-the-wall places to eat in New York. May as well go with something we know we sort of like.\n\nI think that location is preying on people with this mindset, hence why it's situated in the middle of a tourist hotspot like Times Square. They got us.\n\nEdit: For everyone offering suggestions: Thank you!! I'll to visit as many as I can next time I'm in New York!\n\nFor everyone wondering why we didn't google somewhere, I should add that we both like Olive Garden well enough, we weren't really \"opposed\" to eating there. We  were also hungry enough that eating there sounded more appealing than walking 10 min somewhere else. We mostly planned our trip around all the stuff we wanted to see, food was secondary, so we usually just stopped and ate the nearest thing when we got hungry enough. If it's any consolation, the next day we did eat brunch at a local cafe where I had a great Belgian waffle and a true hole-in-the wall Italian place with much better food than Olive Garden, at a better price to boot.",

I pop into the OG to grab a water and use the bathroom and as soon as I walk in, the smell hits me. I'm in the middle of Times Square and all of a sudden, I'm 12 years old with my parents in southeast Michigan, and I'm happy. So I stay. I order the spaghetti and meatballs.

Even if they don't know what a blue steak is and I have to order it \"very-very rare\"! (this is only partly true, one in Orlando knew what a blue steak was and is the only one I've found in the US to do so!)\n\nTexas Roadhouse was good but overpriced for steaks that weren't any better than Outback but free peanuts I suppose!\n\nMcD is the same as the UK but bigger portions for less money. Same as Burger King.\n\n5 Guys is the same as the UK and overpriced for what it is.\n\nWendys had my favourite burgers of the main chains.  Salty, juicy burgers and nice fries.  I'd eat at Wendys a whole load more if there was one in the UK.\n\nArbys for breakfast on the road is good but I'm not a huge fan of their beef sandwich.\n\nSubway is the same as the UK.\n\nKFC is good but they don't do fries in the US which confused me.  I felt like Randy Marsh going \"I'm sorry, I though this was America\" when I found out I couldn't get fries.\n\nPopeyes is good, better than KFC.\n\nChick-fil-A is better than both KFC and Popeyes and their service was really friendly.  The Chick-fil-A sauce for dipping fries into was amazing.  Their stance on LGBT rights though puts me off eating there in future.\n\nCracker Barrel was just.... meh.  Everyone raved about it but it was bland food and lard for gravy.  Maybe I had the wrong thing and so will go again with some southern friends to check next time I'm over.\n\nI'm sure I missed some but, yeah, those chain restaurants in the US that are so common are a new experience for overseas visitors and so we put on a lot of pounds trying them out :)",

We had a friend who came from a much better off home. Our friends mother was a snooty bitch though. Even when I was younger I could tell she looked down on us and mom Because our mom wasn't married to a ford manager and didn't get a nice allowance from her husband. Anyway our friend would always talk about going out to eat at what we thought were amazing places. Outback steakhouse is what we thought was the finest things could get and our buddy would go out to eat there every week. My mom knew this and decided to take us there because we always talked about it and we wanted to have the best steaks in the world. I still remember that meal, fuck I'm getting choked up just thinking about it. So a few days or maybe a week later our friends mom came over and dropped off her son and the first fucking thing we told him was about our trip to outback, our friend was like \"cool\" but his bitch kept mother was like don't get too excited son it's just outback. Of course she said that right in front of my mother knowing that was the best she could do. She stopped bringing him over shortly after that but we got the last laugh. In my early 20s I saw her again when I was working at a retail store while I was at school. She smugly asked \"so what are you doing with your life now\" thinking that this was the best I could ever do and I got to tell her that I just graduated nursing school and passed my nclex exam. Getting to see her stupid smug face turn to a nice shade of embarrassment red was one of the more satisfying experiences I've ever had. Fuck you Wendy",

Shout to my proprietor Tavon who was the nicest dude ever to work for. They did tons of charity work whenever there was a disaster and did yearly overseas work for armed service members. \n\nI had a misunderstanding (mixed up tips on two checks. Still made the same money, no profit to myself, but when I closed one card it over drafted the guys account and he went ballistic and said I did it on purpose because he had a low check -___-) Tavon fired me as was policy and walked me next door to the Bahama Breeze, spoke to that owner and got me hired on the spot and was working the next day.\n\nGood company good people, and if you shit on their food, you're just a snob. It isn't garbage, and a lot of it actually is fresh made and pretty fucking good. Try the braised beef and asiago tortelloni with a cup of the chicken gnocchi soup. Good. Fucking.

Every single place he mentioned was a chain, whether it was fast food like In-n-Out, or a sit-down place like iHop.  He was super excited about The Cheesecake Factory for instance.  \n\nI told him he was nuts.  I can name half a dozen places to go to between where I live in northern California, and where my dad lives in southern California, that are way better than any of the chains he mentioned (I am a travesty to all that is Californian, and only eat at In-n-Out once or twice a year, at most, when my sister who is an In-n-Out fanatic that moved to Seattle, is around...whether at my place or my dad's). \n\nHe tells me that this is easier.  He was choosing chains that they didn't have in Canada, or at least not in Calgary, so they were all new and exciting-ish for the family, but when you go to a chain you know what you're getting for the most part.  There's no guesswork.  When you go to a hole-in-the-wall, you can find the greatest experience possible, or the most disappointing meal you've had in your life.  He didn't need amazing, he just wanted new, and consistent.\n\nHe had his wife and his 5 kids with him on the trip (I mean, it was to Disneyland).  I told him if he ever came and visited me when I was at my dad's, I would be taking him to only non-chain places;  the small cafe on the pier, the burger place on the beach, a Mexican place with quick and easy tacos and the best tortillas you've ever had, etc.  Or if he came and visited me here, the Chinese place that's always empty (took my sister, brother-in-law and then 2 year old nephew to that place, and my nephew had a blast running around the empty restaurant after he'd finished eating), the pho place where I never eat pho, the hot dog place that's only like 4 feet by 6 feet, the burger place that's way bigger and always packed.\n\nAnyway, I understand looking for consistency when everything else you're doing, like you would be as a tourist, is the opposite of consistent.",

You probably aren't going to get anything amazing but you won't get stuck with a 30 dollar plate of canned gravy and boxed mashed potatoes. \n\nCase and point. I tried out this mom and pop bohemian restaurant.  Been a staple of the city I was in for years but business was slowing way down in recent years. I sit down and try to order things that I haven't seen before.  First app I ask for.  \"We didn't make that today.\" Second app I ask for something they have but she informs me they don't make it in house and buy it from cisco for a 20 dollar app? So I'm like fuck it let's just grab a bite. I ask for some version of perogy they didn't make that either.  So I say give me the schnitzel with mashed potatoes and gravy. The 35 dollar plate I paid for couldn't have cost more than 5 dollars to make.  Boxed potatoes. Canned gravy. Prebreaded schnitzel. I asked for the manager and explained I was a young culinary student trying bohemian food for the first time. I tried appealing to his pride in his father's food.  He explained I had already bought it and there would be no substitution. I inform him I'm not paying 35 dollars for this shit. He calls the cops. The cops inform him to take me to civil court and that its not theft of services since I literally had 2 bites of the meal before I called the manager. \n\nFuck you bohemian caf\u00e9.

My 3 older bros got to go celebrate their bdays with my parents and they would each come home bragging about how amazing the food was. Finally my 13th birthday rolled around. I was so pumped to try this (in my young mind) michelin grade food. We get to the restaurant and it was nothing short of amazing.

My parents said i could order anything i wanted. I dont remember what i ordered but i remember that by the time my food came, i was so stuffed from the free cheddar buscuits that i had no room left for my actual dinner.

Been on the go all day with nowt more to nibble on than a bag of peanuts and a mars bar when I stopped there to stretch my legs, drain the main vein and get a cuppa when I spotted them on the counter. They were closing and selling them off cheap so I thought I'd treat myself to a couple. \n\nThey didn't taste bad as such, I've had worse pasties before, but there was something a bit weird about them. Never mind, famished as I was I scoffed them down with my brew and continued upon my merry way. \n\nIt was half way down the M50 that I noticed an ominous gurgling from my guts. Probably as it's the first proper food I've had all day, I thought, it'll soon settle down. Oh no. Not on your life. By the time I was nearing the M4 it was a churning maelstrom of liquid hate. \n\nWell. That was it now. A race against time with the prize being the sanctity of my trousers and the drivers seat of the company van. I thrashed the fuck out of that van where I could, of course being held up along the way by the inevitable queue at the tunnels, variable speed limits and old Mrs. Miggins doing 40 on the outside lane in her VW Lupo. \n\nFoot to the floor, engine groaning like a tuppenny whore, arse twitching like a rabbits nose I made it to the services at Cardiff Gate. Jumping out of the van, speed waddling to the khazi I made it just in time, unleashing an explosive torrent of arse broth as I lowered myself to the seat. \n\nThank you, bowel God. Thank you for holding on so I can keep my dignity. \n\nWhat I learned from all this. Always keep a couple of immodium capsules when on long road trips, and avoid those fucking West Cornwall pasty stalls like the plague. \n\n",
