    "body": "I have worked 4-10's for most of the last 5 years. A few months here and there I worked 5-8's. I prefer the 4-10's. First having a 3 day weekend is amazing. Second one less commute day a week, so 20% less gas and wear and tear on your vehicle. Third most holidays fall on a Monday which makes it a 4 day weekend, or mini vacation. Sure I have to get up a little earlier and stay a little later, but overall I come in before the major traffic and leave after the afternoon rush. It works for me, may not be for everyone  \n\nEdit: so many questions. I work 4 ten hour days a week. I work at a power plant. I used to work sun-wed, but just recently swapped to mon-thur. My core hours are 6am-4pm. I get up around 430 and leave my house by 5. I get home just before 5pm. \n\nIf a holiday falls on my day off, then we get to bank 8 hours of vacation. if it falls on a work day, then 8 hours are free and I have to use 2 hours from my vacation bank. The company off sets this by giving you 1 extra hour of vacation every 2 weeks if you are on 10 hours days. \n\nAlso once a year we shut down for maintenance. 30-60 days. that is when the fun starts. we work 6 days a week 12 hours days the entire shut down. its all or nothing you either work it or turn it all down and they hire a temporary additional to make up for the lost time.\n\nIf they need us to work overtime we work an extra day (5-10s) get 50 hours for the week and still get 2 days off.",

Good boots will last for years if you take care of them.  Also buy a pair of rubber boots, go for the Muck Boot brand; these are excellent for working around manure, mud, whatever nastiness you might want to spare your leather boots from.  The cheaper rubber boots you can buy for ten bucks will ruin your feet if you plan on wearing them for long periods of time.\n\nInvest in a lunch box or a small cooler with a shoulder strap.  I use mine daily, and I never get too far away from it.  For day to day use I keep as much water as I can reasonably fit inside it, snacks, ibuprofen, sunscreen, and other small extras (cigarettes, disposable gloves, bandaids, etc.).  Always be prepared!\n\nGive livestock and farm equipment the utmost respect.  Nothing will fuck you up quicker than a pet cow or a power-take-off shaft.  Always always always be careful.  Any mistake can be fixed or corrected except a missing limb or death.",

Obviously there is going to be crunch to meet a deadline, but if the status quo is more than 40 hours a week they get a big no from me.\n\nEven EA has moved away from crunch.  A few studios, before I left, were doing focused development instead.  You work the same hours, but lunch is catered, there are no meetings, no talking to anyone else unless it is work related, no social media, no browsing the web.  Your ass is in the seat working the whole day, no distractions.  And guess what?  It's far more effective than crunch.
