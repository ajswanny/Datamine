    "body": "Back when my boyfriend and I were \"just friends\", there was a night I spent at his apartment after hanging out together all day. I was going to sleep on the couch, but I managed to talk my  way into his bedroom.\n\nTo get myself into his room, I think I said his roommates or his neighbors were too loud. He got back up to get me a pillow and a blanket so I could sleep on his floor. I had taken off my bra and had asked to borrow his sweater at this point. After a while, I joked that he was hogging all the blankets up in his bed. He finally invited me up.\n\nSo THEN I said I couldn't sleep, and suggested we stay up together to watch a movie. ( Netflix and Chill^^tm )\n\nI had just read in an AskReddit thread that Jurrasic Park was a good date movie, so I suggested we watch it on his phone (without mentioning the date movie part) I was beyond nervous at this point.\n\nSo we're in his bed, he's holding the phone above our eyes, and I decide to lean on his shoulder and slooowly begin the process of inching closer to him. We laid there all night, curled up yet barely touching, neither of us breaking the spell for so much as a peck on the cheek. We fell asleep.\n\nHe wouldn't end up asking me out until ~5 months later. We re-enacted this scene on a hotel bed after sneaking up a bottle of wine from his office Christmas party. This time, I decided to stop being so shy. After a few sips of white wine, I finally felt brave. I looked up into his eyes and kissed him. \n\nLater that night, we admitted that our mutual hesitation during that first night was due to nerves from not wanting to risk our friendship for a one-night stand. The only potential problem in us jumping into a relationship was our distance, because we were living almost 2 hours away from each other. So less than a week after that, I took the bus down to stay for another night. I told him I loved him and that we should try being together anyway.\n\nWe've been together ever since, and we're moving in together in a few weeks.         ",

    "body": "Not a girl but I got a hint once that flew by me phew.\n\nSo my former best friend and I (sadly we do not talk to each other anymore thanks to an ex-girlfriend) were very close. So close even, that I fell in love with her and she apparently was with me.\n\nSo we met more often during the evening, sometimes late at night, watched movies, hung out. She got way more direct with me about being interested in me. When she was dressing up for a party and had n bra on because she was just sitting at home, she suddenly started telling me that I would not need to leave the room when she was changing clothes all of the sudden, she went all cudly on the couch when we watched movies and I was literally thinking \"I could make a move but I am very happy with the friendship I got\" We even went partying and a dude started dancing with her, when she all of the sudden said something to him, pointed at me and the dude ran off (probably said something about me being her boyfriend) but I my train of thought was \"She probably was not interested in that guy\"\n\nThe Apex of my failure however was that one night, we ordered some food, hung out and we talked about the scenario, that if a person insists on someone to sleep at their place even though he/she knows the other person is not too far away from home, that is clearly a hint. \n\nLater that evening, I was about to go home, it was late at night and I had to walk 25 minutes max. So it was not that far. She said \"You know, you can sleep here, we are all alone\" (since she was living with her mother who stayed at her boyfriends place most of the week) and I literally said \"Nah, I am good, it isn't that far anyways.\" \n\nThose two conversations were apart like, 5-10 Minutes.\n\nA bonus on top of my cluelessness: For her 21st birthday I gave her an Iphone. In front of all people, she went to me, hugged me, said  that there is only one thing to make this moment perfect and looked me deep in the eyes. I did no-thing.\n\nSeriously. If I would have had a time machine, I would have kicked myself into reacting right now. Since it could have been the best relationship in my life.\n\nLesson learned: If you do not act, you get shit on.\n\nEDIT: Sorry for not answering since it was late at night here in Germany and I had to go to bed but whew! Thanks for so many answers and encouraging words. Since there are so many answers telling me I should call her, I will try tomorrow (since it is father's day here [25th May]) and will edit this again after I call her to tell you how it went.\n\nFor those asking how long we were not talking: Oktober 2014. We saw eachother while getting groceries 3 times I think and I ran into her while training for a half marathon but I tried saying \"hi\" once (this was shortly after we had the falling out) and she did not say anything which really threw me off so much that I did not try again and as far as I know she is single as am I.\n\nEDIT2: So, I won't talk around the outcome to long since most of you were very excited how it went. Sadly, she changed her phone number over the last 2 years, which lead me to me going to her house seeing if either she or her mother was there. In a stroke of bad luck, she must have moved out recently. I knew she wanted to move out for quite a while to live on her own while her mother moved in with her boyfriend which means, the chances are quite low in talking to her as of right now.\n\nBUT: We shared a lot of the same friends from school and have had mostly the same social circle for years, from well, being best friends, I am hoping to see her at a party in about 3 weeks. If she is there, I will start a conversation and explain myself. If there is an outcome either way, I will keep you updated but for now, this is sadly it.\n\nI am however thankful for all the support you gave me since I would have never taken that chance if all of you haven't been there and I hope this entire thing will have a conclusion in a few weeks! :)\n\nFINAL EDIT: This will be my final edit, since basically everything came to a close. As I said, I texted her on Facebook, she answered and we decided to meet last night. And so we did. We talked everything through, everything from all the past drama, what mistakes we made, how we both made mistakes and how I was a total idiot for not recognizing what she was hinting at.\nIt was weird at first talking so open about feelings you had years ago but we got there. I even mentioned how you guys helped me take initiative and it made her laugh that thousands of people pushed me to go talk to her.\n\nAt the end of the night, we really didn't know what to do with ourselves. Of course we couldn't just go at it or say \"We are in a relationship now\", As I said, we haven't talked to each other for quite some time and we have become slightly different people. \n\nBut we were both okay to start by going on a date, catching up and getting to know each other better again and see from where it goes from there.\n\nI want to thank all of you guys for supporting me and pushing me towards the right choice and if everything works out, happiness.\n\nIn the end, I am more than baffled that from a single post about how I am an absolute idiot for not getting a hint, something like this can evolve and that there are always two sides to everything especially the internet where most of the time, toxicity is the normality and the support and kindness I recieved, is something more rare.\n\nBasically, thank you for helping me :)\n\nUPDATE:\nSo, many of you people wrote me PMs and wanted to know what happened and how things are going. Short answer: Things are going great!\nWe are a happy couple and just enjoy ourselves. It was awkward for our friends at first but things basically became normal after a while. \nFor my part, you guys motivated me to get something or better put someone back that I have gave up two years earlier. Seriously you guys made my year one of the best years in my entire life.\n\nFor that I thank you so much.\n\nI appreciate the two Golds I got, which were my first two ever so another thanks to those who gave it.\n\nThank you :)",

I'll catch him after his nap.\" I jump out of bed, but some pants and a shirt on and go down the hallway to fold laundry.\n\nNot but a couple minutes later my husband comes running down the hallway before coming to screeching halt in front of me, he's doing his best to be smooth with a hint of awkward. He didn't realize I was initiating sexy time at all. He pulled out all his best moves and dragged me back in to the bedroom.  \n\nTL;DR - Sat in front of my husband mostly naked, he didn't realize I was initiating sexy time.",

Most of our friends never figured it out and we left a lot of people confused saying it was 330 out of nowhere in the middle of conversations and events and just taking off like something was on fire.\n\nAnyways. One night with a group of friends, alcohol, beer pong, loud music, and card games... The usual. She is playing in my hair with a beer in the other hand and says \"is it 330 yet?\" I pull out my cellphone and it's literally 3 something but not quite literally 330 I think the actual proximity of the time to being literally 330 threw off my understanding and the alcohol. I said \"nah it's 3(whatever).\" And continued on with whatever conversation I was having lol. I distinctly remember her just pausing abruptly confused and I'm sure my response sobered her up immediately. She burst into laughter and says \"ok\"\n\nSo the night finally ends and she had already ducked off into the room she wanted to sleep in. I make my way in however long later. She trips me as I come into the room I about bust my head against the corner of the bed and she says these exact words lol \"next time I ask you if it's 330, you better pull your dick out instead of your phone or we're going to have some problems!\" Sex with her was incredible but her appetite was way higher than mine and I couldn't keep up at the time which is part of why we aren't together anymore lol.

We have been together for 11 years and we know each other's body languages very well. He also knows that I'm down for sex pretty much all the time, and I'm definitely not going to tell him no. If my panties are down its definitely about to happen. Yes, at that moment he was either completely zoned out or being very dense. Because of his lack of response I figured he was either too tired or not in the mood and didn't want to make him feel pressured so I dropped it and put the new pair on. A few days later I was reading aloud excerpts from a thread similiar to this and it suddenly dawned on him. He was face palming so hard and we both had a great laugh over it. ",

But I was lab partners with the two most popular girls in school (one was cheerleader captain and the other was SGA VP) and they were gorgeous.  Despite my nerd status, they found me interesting.  At the end of senior year, prom conversations started but I was NOT going....I didn't have a girlfriend and only had a couple dates in high school and the easiest way to avoid all that BS was to simply not go.  Then they cornered me:\n\nTHEM: Who are you taking to prom?\n\nME: No one. I'm not going.\n\nTHEM: You HAVE to go! EVERYONE is going!\n\nME: Nah, it's not my thing. Besides, who would I go with?\n\nTHEM: You should ask Jonelle (the other cheerleader captain who recently broke up with her boyfriend).\n\nME: What?!?! She'd never go with me.\n\nTHEM: Oh, I bet she would if you asked her.\n\nME: No way.\n\nTHEM: You HAVE to!\n\nMe: Nope.\n\n[End scene]\n\nWhat I didn't realize at the time was that girls operate differently from boys. This wasn't some random conversation. There was no betting on their part. This was all planned with Jonelle's blessing. This was the three most popular girls in school plotting to get me, a nerd, to ask one of them to prom... and I didn't fucking realize it!!! Woulda, SHOULDA, coulda...didn't.\n",

End of the night, it's just me and crush left, she asks me If I Want To Sleep Over(!), (we haven't even kissed at this point) we get into her Twin bed together, and then somehow, stupendously, my incredible na\u00efvet\u00e9 still manages to find a loophole in my potential happiness when she says, \"not that we should do anything\", meaning, in hindsight obviously, that we needn't immediately have sex. I somehow take this to mean *anything* at all and don't so much as try to kiss this beautiful woman all through the night as we are uncomfortably sharing her tiny bed. At one point before we fall into tense sleep I go so far as to try to wrap one of my arms around her, but in the process I remember her warning about doing anything and jerk my arm back into its little tuck across my chest, pleased at having averted potential catastrophe. I wake up the next morning quite glowy nevertheless, if a little confused at the apparent irritability of my platonic bed partner. I go home for the summer with our relationship unconsummated, she moves on in my absence, and that's how I got into hard drugs. ",
