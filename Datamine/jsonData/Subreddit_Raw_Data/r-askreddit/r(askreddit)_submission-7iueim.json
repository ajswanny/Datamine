He\u2019d jump on the bed at night and curl around my face keeping me warm (sometimes too warm) I used to joke that he was a communist, as he sometimes barked at certain things on tv, mostly always the news, and to give him a little nickname he was my little commie (just through communism made it funnier, could have come up with something else with a bit more time).

It was all so sudden, I broke down when I got to the wake. \n\nI decided to celebrate my birthday the next day. I know she would have wanted me to celebrate and would have been mad at me for being sad. I had a full day and night of activities to do too. Had a very bad case of the flu instead. I had it checked out the next day and it was chickenpox.\n\nSo now, I'm in my room isolated from everyone else. Supposedly I was going to spend the next weekend with my girlfriend, it was supposed to be our first time literally spending the night with each other. We've already booked an AirBnB here in the city. It was a nice place too, and I was going to teach her how to cook. I guess that's out of the window as well. \n\nI haven't been to work since the 1st. I miss it. Nobody told me that having chickenpox takes a long recovery time. It sucks, I keep building up that December is my favorite time of the year; but nope, life decides that I shouldn't be too happy instead.",

But the day after thanksgiving he started having stomach problems, and they got so bad on Thursday that he had to go to the ER. The doctor told him that he didn't know enough to give a good diagnosis, so he gave my dad pain meds and told him to talk to his oncologist on Monday.\n\nMy cat stopped eating two weeks ago. For those who don't know, cats who go without food for 24 hours are at severe risk for a disease called hepatic lipidosis, or fatty liver, which can lead to liver failure very quickly. So I had to force feed him kitten formula until I could get him into the vet. $1000 later they have no idea what's wrong with him except that he's got a bit of inflammation around the entrance to his intestines. He's eating now, but the idea that there's this mysterious health problem lurking is killing me. The vet also said that he has \"old kidneys\" and said that some cats just have a shorter timeframe than other cats, and that there's nothing I can do now. If/when his kidneys fail we can see about treatment. He's only 8.\n\nOn Friday my boss called me in to his office and told me they're terminating my position because they've \"decided to go in another direction\". My job is location-dependent and can't be effectively outsourced so I have no idea what that means, it's just a non-answer. I have a week to get my open projects closed. A week and a half before Christmas, I'll be unemployed.\n\nAll in all, things have fallen apart and are going to keep doing so for the foreseeable future.\n\nHow are you?",

There's pretty much no hope of her finding anything else due to her health issues, so we're pretty much facing financial ruin within the next few months. We are also about to lose our health insurance with no means in sight of getting any more, so things are about to get really interesting (depressing).\n\nAnd Christmas is 2 weeks away and I haven't been able to afford a single present for my wife or 3 kids, and now with the news about her job it doesn't seem like that will change. Gonna be a weird Christmas for sure.\n\nBasically, life sucks, but thanks for the opportunity to vent.\n\nEDIT: rereading this makes me feel like an idiot for complaining. Things work out eventually one way or another, no sense in bitching about it. I also realize that there are a great deal of other people that have it so much worse than we do, I have to remember to try and focus my energy on other things besides my own shit.

All I do when I'm home is play videogames. I barely study, I force myself to knit and never exercise or play my guitar like I want to. Our roommate is a bad influence on my fiance and I and we all get sucked into the lazy sphere when he's around.\n\nOnce we move to the new house next year it'll be better because everything in our house will be ours and we won't have third parties around to screw everything up. I really think that's all I need--a place that's *mine* for the first time in my life.

I'm gonna go eat an egg sandwich and go to the gym so I can be hyped to study for my exam tomorrow.\n\nThank you for posting this thread.

I won\u2019t sugar coat it, I was definitely in a very dark place for a while. \n\nAnyway, a few days ago, I woke up in a mood. You know how it is: you wake up and you\u2019re just tired, and it\u2019s cold and gray outside, and you know you lack the mental fortitude to actually get ready for work with anything remotely resembling haste. I worked myself into such a funk that morning that I was in tears on the way to work, just wallowing thinking about everything that had been on my plate recently. \n\nWell as luck would have it, I had a great fucking day. My commute was surprisingly traffic free. The manager who has been low key sabotaging my work was let go this morning. I got recognized by HIS boss for my effort and offered a chance to shift projects towards something more intellectually stimulating and fulfilling, I had a BOMB ASS lunch. My morning deuce was life changing. Things were just going really really well. \n\nI called a friend of mine just to tell her about my day and how well things were going and I came to a bit of a realization:\n\nYou can start the day off in the most positive frame of mind and still have bullshit happen to you. \n\nBut you can also start the day of damn depressed and still have a great ass day. \n\nI was just lucky enough not to be so stuck in my funk that I could recognize the good shit that happened that day. And I\u2019m sure now I\u2019ve had good days in the past that I failed to recognize. So I might as well just be in a good fucking mood and handle my shit cuz life is just gonna keep throwing curveballs at you and you might as well feel fucking good as you try and catch em. \n\nIt\u2019s probably cliche as fuck, but MAN am I doing great. \n\n\nPS - I wrote this while taking another life changing dook. My colon and I are in sync lately I love it. ",

They're probably too lazy to take thar seriously as well.\n\nJust so you know, even after getting evicted, you're still responsible for paying all the remaining rent each month. Even worse, if any roommates stop paying, they'll come after the other ones for the rent money.\n\nWhen my older brother was in college his roommate went to jail and then skipped town. My brother was stuck paying the full rent for the remaining 6 months. When my brother couldn't afford to pay the double rent the company went after my brother bc the other guy had basically disappeared.\n\nJoint and severed liability is indeed a bitch. \n\n[Another example of having to pay rent after eviction.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/7iueim/how_are_you_doing/dr1whl7/) \n\n**Edit** This is why it's much smarter to have the school pick your roommate (since they'll have all the real info on the person), or just go with a friend.

    "body": "I was about to end my life 15 months ago. I was hospitalized for four days and it changed my life. I felt rested for the first time ever, after sleeping for nearly 20 hours. I was working two shit jobs, lived in a shit apartment, and wasn\u2019t going anywhere. Once I got out, I was dazed and trying to figure out where to go from there. Every morning I\u2019d wake up and go \u201chuh, I guess I\u2019m still alive, now what?\u201d\n\n\nI decided to just start doing what I wanted. I applied for a veterinary technician job with no prior experience, I had been busting my ass miserably trying to make it in the comp sci industry for years, but it was passionless for me. I loved animals as a child, but thought it was silly to peruse as a career for some reason. I was terrified of needles for years, and for that reason thought medicine was not an option for me. \n\n\nSomehow, only a little over a week after I got out the hospital, the vet clinic called me and offered me an interview. I managed to get up and get dressed and go to the clinic, I walked in on a doctor performing surgery and was so numb and nervous I didn\u2019t even flinch. Somehow my fear of needles was gone. \n\n\nA year and a half later, I\u2019m still a vet tech. My job is dirty, hard, and very stressful. But I have bottle fed abandoned new born kittens. I have held the hands and dried the tears of owners while we said goodbye to their best friend.  I have held parvo puppies and loved them so much, watching the medicine I administered save their life. I have seen that same parvo puppy come in for her vaccinations a month later, bouncing off the walls and licking every face she can get close to. \n\n\nI will be 24 in June, and can finally apply for financial aid using my own salary, rather than my parents. I\u2019ll be going back for biology, and then I intend to go to vet school. It will take years,and a lot of money, but I see no better way to spend my life than chasing my dream. I have two beautiful rescue kitties to come home to every night. I have coworkers who are just as obsessed and passionate about animals as I am. Every day I use my body to the maximum, lifting dogs and bags of food, running through the clinic, playing with puppies in the yard, wrangling fractious cats. I use my brain to the maximum as well, balancing patient histories, patient treatment schedules, helping the doctors with differentials, and trying to remember to turn over the laundry. \n\n\nI am still taking anti depressants, and I go to therapy once a week. I wasn\u2019t born with a purpose, but I decided what mine would be. I\u2019m here to lessen the suffering in the world, as much as I am able, for people, animals, and myself. I have been to the bottomless pit of despair many times, but life got better, all because I decided to stay alive. ",

Just make it a night she\u2019ll never forget and I promise it will be perfect! Congratulations!  ",

    "body": "Hey, so I slept on an air mattress for MONTHS, and if you set it up right it's about 1/2 the cost of a mattress, but just about as comfy. You need:\n\n1 twin blow up bed.  \n2 cotton 'quilted' mattress protectors (the kind that fit like a fitted sheet, not the flat kind.)     \n1 non-memory foam mattress topper.  \n2 plain-ole blankets. it helps if they are dense.  \n\n(This can be done with a sleeping bag, but I think that makes it hard to wash.)\n\nThen, you need a normal set of twin bedding.  \n\nBlow up the mattress. Put one mattress protector on one side and put that side down on the ground. This will help protect the airbed from punctures and will help limit cold seeping in from the floor. Layer the foam and two blankets as neatly as possible on top. Cover them with the other mattress protector. Now the bed should have two layers protecting the sides, at least. Since you have a cat, you may want to tuck one of the blankets into the bottom protector to give the bed protection from your kitty. Now, dress the bed normally. You'll need to blow it up a bit more every few days, but it should stay relatively comfy. If you find you are getting cold at night on the bottom side, add a few more blankets between you and the air mattress.",

At 16 a lot of shit was happening in my life, I grew up with a lot of physical and emotional abuse in the house. I didn't trust anyone in my family with the exception of my father and my grandmother. My grandmother got diagnosed with cancer, and a friend of mine died in a car accident. I got to the point where I was planning how I was going to commit suicide. My next door neighbor had a wife and two kids. His life started spiraling downhill as well with crippling debt and struggling to afford just simple things for his family. He committed suicide while his wife and kids were out. The impact that was left on that family was horrific. CPS had to come in and take the kids, the wife was inconsolable, and she still had to deal with all the debt and getting her kids back. But now she had to do it alone. No matter how hard life gets there will be an upswing, it's just a rollercoaster. It goes down sometimes, and it's scary, but it always goes back up. I'm a Second Class Petty Officer in the Navy now, and I absolutely love it and plan on doing twenty years. This past year my grandmother died and I got news that my father will be dead by next August. It's hard right now especially since I can't go see him for the holidays, but I now that no matter what life throws at me I can take it. Because that's what humans are good at, bouncing back and staying resilient through any adversity. I hope you the best, no matter what happens you can get through it.",

After a month or so of drunken debauchery fuelled by the devastation, I started writing, gyming (like, obsessively), started a Marshall art and tried to fill my weeks fully, even if it meant on a weekend I was in some meetup group hiking somewhere with OAPs. Didn\u2019t know anyone in the city either, so it was all pretty daunting. Also, all my close mates beyond were all settled and married or whatever. But keeping busy really really helped. Even though it felt pretty desperate at the time. Your comment struck a chord with me so just offering my experience. Don\u2019t think the sting ever really disappears, but it definitely became manageable and turned me into a better, less selfish person.

I know it seems impossible right now, because I was in the exact same spot as you, but whatever led to it, followed a certain sequence of events. \n\nThe absolute best thing to do for yourself is get off of Facebook or any other social media, cut off contact with him entirely, delete everything related to him, and just take care of yourself. Find some kind of self-care, whether it's working out, or skincare, or makeup, or something else you're passionate about. Music, pick up something new. When people reach out to you, let them. \n\nThe worst thing we've been taught is this whole bullshit story about \"the one\". The truth is, if this shit hadn't happened now, it'd have happened later.

You're better off getting it over with now that having your entire life fall apart 10 years later and find out the last decade of your life was spent with a stranger (because that's what it feels like during a breakup, that this person you thought you knew was a different person all along). That would be devastating... Think about it in those terms. It doesn't feel like it right now, but you will have learnt something from all this and become a much better person for it.
