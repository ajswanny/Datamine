Okay, I'm late to the party here, but I've got a great answer for this.\n\nI was working as a summer counselor at a college, helping incoming freshmen pick classes and stuff like that.  The job was exhausting, but I loved it, so I poured my all into it, making arts and crafts in my off time to make the experience more fun for the kids, writing skits, building sets and costumes, that sort of thing.  The result was that I barely slept (3-4 hours per night, for 3 months on end).\n\nOne night, around 3 am, just as I was going to bed, I realized that I'd forgotten to tell my kids that tomorrow's meeting was in my office, and not at the outside benches where we'd met the day before.  Oops!  So I sat down to write a note for each of my students.  Here's what I wrote:\n\n    Hi (Student Name),\n        Just letting you know that we're all meeting in my office\n    tomorrow at 9 am instead of at the benches.\n    Thanks,\n    Kahzgul\n\nSimple, right?  i sat down to write out 12 notes and I was dozing off as I did so.  Finally got them all done around 4 am and delivered them under each student's dorm room door.  Slept for 3 hours!\n\nThe next morning at 9 am sharp, the students started filing into my office.  As they sat in the chairs, one asked, \"Mr. Kahzgul, why didn't I get a funny note like everyone else?\"\n\nUm... what?  I didn't write any funny notes.  I wrote.. Oh God.  I had been dozing off...  WHAT DID I WRITE???\n\nAnd here, dear reader, is what the notes said:\n\n    Dear (student),\n        Just letting you know that I see bicycles bicycling.\n    --Kahzgul\n\n    Dear (student),\n        Just letting you know that we're all crazy everywhere.\n    You can eat here, enjoy the food.\n    Thanks,\n    Kahzguuuuuul\n\n    Dear Student (I actually wrote \"student\" instead of their name),\n        Student student student.  Student.\n    --Kahzgul\n\n    Dear (student),\n        Just letting you know that office buildings explode.\n    Love,\n    Kahzgul\n\n    Dear (student),\n        I don't know why I'm writing this.  I see it.  Maybe.\n\n    Dear (student),\n        Just letting you know that we're all meeting people all the time\n    everywhere we go.\n    Thanks,\n    Kahzgul (and then I drew a heart with an arrow through it)\n\n    Dear (student),\n        Just letting you know that we're all meeting in my room\n    tomorrow morning at 9 am.  SHARP!  sharp.  *sharp*.\n    **SHARPPPPP**.\n    --**KAHZGUL**  (sharp)\n\nThe other notes were all the intended message.  Needless to say, I was freaked the hell out.  Thank GOD my students thought this shit was hilarious, because I do not, to this day, remember writing any of those (but they were definitely in my handwriting).\n\nedit:  Gold!  I'm so happy that this story is making so many people laugh!\n\nedit 2:  Holy cow you guys, 3x gold?!  I'm so happy this is making everyone laugh so much!!!",

I found a good sized stick, and as any bored sixthgrader would do, I picked it up and started dragging it along with me as I walked, just something I did to keep my focus. As my friends and I were approaching an intersecting street, a small blue pickup crossed in front of us. Normally we didn't have to worry about too many cars as we lived in a smaller town, but it just sort of interested me how it crossed perfectly about 15 feet in front of us. I just saw it and wondered subconsciously, 'I wonder if I could hit it from here.' With the brainpower I normally use for sleeping, I held the stick I was dragging over my head, and threw it like a javelin at the truck. If it were a video game, I would of scored a critical hit. The stick struck the truck directly on the side, creating what I imagined as a deafening noise. \n\nBy the time I realized what the fuck I just did, two of my friends ran and hid in the bushes, and the other was pretending to tie his shoe. A tall figure stormed out of the truck, a highschooler. I don't remember what he said, I was in shock,  but I can imagine something along the lines of, \"What the hell are you doing!\" Out of realization of what just happened, I just sorta stuttered,\"I uh, wasn't thinking, I, um, I didn't really sleep well,\" and a few bullshit excuses similar to that. \"Alright, just don't let it happen again.\" \n\nI unofficially became that idiot friend everyone has, we never really talked about it after that \n",

The accepted etiquette for the men's room is nigh-on universal, but for those who might not know (and there seem to be a fair number of you), it can be described as such:\n\n1. Enter the restroom.    \n2. If there is a urinal available and the ones next to it are *not* in use, approach and do your business.    \n3. If there is a urinal available and the ones next to it *are* in use, find another urinal.    \n4. If no other urinals are available (save for ones with adjacent users), approach, stare straight ahead, and finish as quickly as possible.    \n5. If there are *no* urinals available, use a stall. Be sure to close and lock the door.    \n6. If there are no urinals *or* stalls available, stand behind a urinal - keeping as much distance between you and the current occupant as possible - and pretend to be very interested in either the floor or the ceiling.\n\nThese rules are in place for the specific purpose of minimizing embarrassment, and they work well if everyone follows them. Unfortunately, while in a caffeine-deprived haze, I managed to accidentally exploit an unfortunate loophole.\n\nI had walked into the restroom, intent on... well, you can guess... and discovered that none of the urinals were available. Fortunately, one of the stall doors was ajar, indicating that it was unoccupied... or so I thought. Upon entering the stall in question, I discovered that it was already in use by someone who had neglected to close the door, and who was midway through their \"expulsion of fluids.\" \n\nHad I been in a sounder state of mind, I would have hurriedly exited and waited for a different section of the facility to become available. As it happened, I decided that the best course of action was to lounge against the wall - still inside of the stall, mind you - and twiddle with my phone until the guy finished his performance. It was only as he was nearing completion that I realized what I was doing, and I rushed to exit the stall before my unwitting co-occupant noticed my presence.\n\nOf course, that was right when someone *else* entered the restroom. They saw me leave the stall, assumed that it was empty, and walked forward... right into the *original* occupant, who was making his own exit.\n\nI decided to hold it in for a while after that.\n\n**TL;DR: There's a party in the men's room, but no-one was invited.**",

    "body": "As a child I had a fairly standard routine. I would come home from school, go to the fridge and grab a snack before anything else, then go to my room and drop off my backpack/turn on toonami and wait for DBZ to start.\n\nOne morning I woke up and gathered my things before heading out for the bus. I put my folders into the bag, told my mom I was leaving and skipped along with my day. I made it through the first couple hours of the day pretty easily, but when it came time for Writing (this was in elementary school mind you), I couldn't find my yellow folder. In fact, I couldn't remember the last place I even saw the yellow folder.\n\nWelp, I was an anxious little kid and my teacher at the time was kind of a dick about us forgetting stuff, so I started freaking out a little and then the teacher comes over to investigate and between my nervous fast-talk and stuttering, she got understandably frustrated and told me that everything was fine, and that she would help me get out my yellow folder so we could move on with class. Then she went digging in my bag and couldn't find it. When she realized it wasn't there she checked the desk and still didn't find it and asked me, \"The_Fad, where's your folder?\" So I told her I didn't have it. She sighed and said it was okay, just remember to bring it in tomorrow. \n\nWelp, I was an anxious little kid and the fact that she was being nice about my failure just made me more jittery and one thing led to another and suddenly I was hyperventilating. The teacher starts freaking out, the kids start freaking out, which just makes me freak out even more. The teacher intercoms for the nurse and I decide that the best, more calming, cool place for me to be is the floor. So I slide out of my chair and just kind of slump on the floor, trying to nonchalantly land on my back so I could just stare at the ceiling and calm myself down. Unfortunately it was less a graceful slide and more a jittery flop, so all the kids gasp and the teacher flips around to see me suddenly on the floor, splay-legged and arms higgledy-piggledy.\n\nWelp, I was an anxious little kid and I suddenly realized I'd just made all these poor people think I was having a seizure or something so I started stuttering and trying to explain myself while trying to sit up, but the teacher had rushed over and kept me held down. A few moments later the nurse burst into the room with the principal. The nurse took over and managed to calm me down after a few tense minutes of everyone staring directly at me.\n\nAfterward they took me to the office and called my mom, who quickly arrived on the scene. They explained what had happened but I was too embarrassed to add my side, so when my nurse said \"seizure\" my mom stuck to it and was super worried, even though the nurse was an elderly woman who had probably never even became a true RN or medical professional of any sort.\n\nSo we got in the car and on the drive home my mom asked me how I was feeling and everything, making nervous chitter chatter but dancing around the dark cloud over us. I eventually got up the gumption to explain to her it was just because I couldn't find my yellow folder. She breathed a sigh of relief and thanked me for being honest.\n\nWhen we got home I hopped out of the car with my bag, home around lunch time because of the episode, and hustled inside. I was hungry something fierce from my ordeal, so I dropped my bag at the top of the stairs and went to the fridge. I opened it up expecting to grab some fruit or maybe some lunch meat for a sandwich, but there, between the jug of milk and a water bottle, was my yellow folder.",

I get out and start walking up the hill, and just find rubble. \n\nI knew very well that they'd been tearing the place down for a month or so, I'd driven past it. I kinda wish I *hadn't* known that though, that would make for a better story. \"OH MY GOD MY HOUSE IS DESTROYED!\"\n\nBut no, I realized I had driven to the wrong place but my brain was so sure I was right that it wouldn't let go of it. It took me about 10 seconds (maybe-- it may have been 2 or 3 seconds. It felt like forever) to remember where I lived.\n\nEDIT: Also someone else had this problem once, and I was the victim. In the dorms, I was happily sleeping when some stranger gets in bed with me. We'd forgotten to lock the doors and this guy just walked in and joined me. In my panicked state all that I could come out with was \"WHERE ARE YOU SUPPOSED TO BE?\" He sat up quickly and just stared for like 20 seconds saying \"I'msorryI'msorry... where... where am... I'msorry... where...\" \n\nThat was probably more drunk/stoned than autopilot.",

So, I quietly mumbled something about the restroom being occupied. Only, the janitor did not hear me and came in to clean. At this point, I began to  panic and all rationality in my brain shut off. What I should have done was let her know that I was there. This is not what happened. Instead, I held my breath, hoping she would leave without noticing me. Nope. She proceeded to clean while I sat still and unable to finish my poo. This went on for a good 5-10 minutes before she finally got near my stall and noticed me sitting there. She also freaked out, apologized profusely, and fled. Having found myself mysterious constipated, I wiped my ass without finishing and rushed out of the building with my head down, hoping not to run into that poor old lady. \n\nMoral of the story: always yell back.
