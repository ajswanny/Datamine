    "body": "City council hired another medic. Older dude with long hair, not that that matters. He was new to the scene recently completing the course. \n\nGuy why awesome to hang out with. Went to the bar with the younger emts, played video games, etc. \n\nAt first I thought he was cool but as I observed his work (I was his superior and did his probationary eval) I noticed something was off. \n\nAt the private council meeting I spoke openly about this in his 30 day review. I stated something was off. He didn't seem like a people person and generally the type that would do this job. \n\nThey said that I had no grounds to state that he wasn't suited and that he did his job as described. \n\nI countered with the fact that when caring for people being a people person is an unwritten rule and that doing your job without caring leads to mistakes, and in our job field a mistake means death. \n\nThey weren't having it so I finally said \"look in this job field you need to learn to read people and in telling you that something isn't right here\"\n\nCity council told me that basically I was jealous because he got along with the emts. Honestly I could careless, I'm not in this job for them. \n\nFast forward a month and I get a call from an er about an hour from us. They said that their report said the patient was administered 80mg of drug x.  The patient denied receiving it and since they couldn't figure out wtf the medic would have even given it they ran a tox panel on him which showed that he did not receive it. \n\nThe doc told me normally he'd let it slide as an error and ask me to speak to him about accuracy, but he felt something was off. \n\nI thanked him and after hanging up pulled the trip sheets. Right in the run report it has the drug, the amount given, and the time. \n\nI pulled up the narcotics log. It showed drug given and replenished along with the tag numbers. \n\nNext I called a friend of mine who is a local cop and was off duty at the time. He came over and I opened the other medics narc box. Sure enough it had been opened and replaced. \n\nWe then went through his logs for the past 2 months he had been working and located at least 12 times drugs had been given when probably not needed. \n\nI called the er doc back and explained to him and his exact quote \"here's my personal phone number and our lawyers number. I'll fax you over a written statement along with the test results.  I'll see if we have anything on other patients he brought in\"\n\nMy buddy then called dispatch to tell the council members there was an emergency at the station and they need to come in. \n\nWhen they got there we showed them all the evidence and what we suspected. Within 15 minutes we not only had the da approval but also a judge sign an arrest warrant. \n\nTurns out the dude admitted to having a 20 year pain killer addiction that he ran out of sources so he figured being a medic would give him easy access. He even told the judge he was worried that he would have killed someone just for the meds. \n\nAt the trial I was asked for what resolution I wanted. I told the judge being a paramedic I've seen how drugs change a person and that I don't hold him fully responsible. On my recommendation he got 3 months in a locked drug rehab facility followed by 6 months of house arrest. \n\n4 years later the dude is clean and runs a fund raiser to help raise money for the end to provide anonymous narcan services and drug awareness programs. \n\nToday this guy would be an honored member of my crew. Addiction literally changes people. \n\nThe end result is I now am solely responsible for hiring the medics, reviewing, and dismissal. I no longer need to justify to council why someone was dismissed. This job is one where a gut feeling decides someone's fate. ",

The younger boy was kept alive by--you guessed it-- his older sister.   The police were led to the house by neighbors' complaints about the stench.  \n\nSo this poor, smelly girl was suffering abuse from her parents, and all the while sneaking food and water to her little brother--who was *literally locked in a cage* for years upon years... keeping him alive-- and then coming to school, where she would be avoided and mocked behind her back and sometimes humiliated. \n\nShe was a weirdo, and our \"guts\" all told us there was something wrong there. \n\nBut she was a fucking hero.   \n\n(never heard what happened to her after the parents were arrested.  hope she recovered.)

They ended up divorcing, and he has proven to be a complete sociopath ever since. He hadn't paid a dime in child support, despite being well off enough to buy a new luxury sports car every few years, and uses their two kids (who are now teenagers who know he's full of shit) to play mind games with my sister--bringing her to court for full custody, knowing he won't win due to his past, just to cause her inconvenience and rack up legal fees for her, just as an example. He also has refused to let the kids fly out to visit our side of the family a few times for no reason whatsoever.

You know how someone who hasn't eaten in a long time looks when the finally get a meal they love set in front of them?  That's how Jason's eyes looked when he looked at those little girls, like he was hungry and they were his meal.  \n\n\nAbout two years ago Jason's dad married a woman with two young daughters.  Jason would often volunteer to babysit.  About a year ago Jason was arrested and convicted of raping both those little girls multiple times.  \n\nFuck you Jason.

Then we ALL went back to the house.\n\nWe weren't home long before I heard him and my mom giggling in the hallway and suddenly I just felt sick. (I was about 12 at the time, btw).

We're all in the living room watching TV. I'm hesitant at first but my mom encourages me. Apparently he had sisters and knew how to brush girl's hair. I kept my hair about waist length back then and it was a bitch to get the knots out so I caved and let him brush my hair.\n\nHe just brushed it, no big deal. So when he offered other times I let him. Then one day he offered while no one was there. Because my hair was so long why don't I sit up on the edge of the chair in front of him? Oh, hey, would you like a back rub? I rub your mom's back all the time.\n\nI should mention this wasn't my first interaction with a perv and I actually was very bothered just by being that close to someone. I hated being touched back then but because everyone obviously liked this guy I told myself I shouldn't cause any problems.\n\nNext thing I know he says, \"Can I rub down a little further? In front? It's your decision, you're completely in charge here.\"\n\nThank God I had the courage to say no. I avoided him for AGES after that and didn't have to sense to tell my mom or my brothers. This guy proceeds to find ways to get both of my older brothers out of the house by the time I'm 15. He goes long periods of time seeming to be a perfectly good guy and then out of nowhere hits me with something pervy and horrid. Sophomore year comes up and we get our class rings. Well, these things are not cheap and we've always been fairly poor. My mom says I have to ask Dumbass (Named changed, not so obviously ;) ) for the money. I ask him to buy my class ring and he says, \"What's in it for me?\" I go silent. My mom is RIGHT THERE. She innocently says, \"She can bake you a cake.\" I'm good at baking. He's quiet for a while and has to think it through. Then he says, \"Okay, but there are rules.\" I forget what all of the rules were, stupid stuff mostly, but his final rule was \"If you lose this ring you get naked.\"\n\n\"what?\"\n\"This is an expensive ring. It's a lot of money so you better not lose it or you get naked for me.\"\nMy mom tells him to stop but only halfheartedly. When I try to talk to her about it later she says, \"Well, I guess you better not lose it.\"\n\nAt that point I kinda figured I couldn't count on my Mom for help. Over the years I've learned she was messed with a lot when she was younger and has convinced herself that all men are this way. I love my mom to death but it kills me that she believes this.\n\nHe's never stopped being a total asshole. I lived with them until I was 20. I was very shy and having a job was very hard for me. I tried moving in with my oldest brother to help him take care of his kid but after three months I was asking to come home and once again got the \"what's in it for me\" response. I got to hear all about how he'd lived the past few years just for me and mom. Bought us a house and everything and how ungrateful I was. I came back to what was essentially a prison. I had my nephew with me at first as my brother was going to give my Mom custody of him. That is, until my stepdad got mad at him and kicked him hard. A three year old little boy who hadn't done anything more than annoy him probably by making noise. So mom calls up my brother and tells him to come get him because she's afraid to have him around my stepfather. Then once he's gone she convinces herself that he never did that.\n\nFinally I met my first boyfriend. By this time I'm 20. I had gotten two part time jobs and he worked at one of them. I was hanging out at his house a lot and my stepdad got jealous. He decided to give me a curfew of midnight and said if I break it then I'm out of the house and can't ever come back unless I sleep with him because he knows I can't be a virgin anymore (I was) so there was no excuse now.\n\nI cried to my boyfriend and he told me I could come live with him. This was after we'd only been seeing each other for about three weeks. That night I didn't go home. My stepfather called me and screamed, called me a \"stupid little bitch,\" and I screamed back and told him how he made my life a living hell. An hour later he and mom pull up with his truck full of all of my stuff that he could put in it. He took my car because it was Mom's and dumped my stuff right there telling my boyfriend I was his problem now. I will never forget the smirk on my Mom's face when she hugged me and I apologized for everything. She said she wasn't mad at me at all but was proud.\n\nApparently I'd had the guts to do what she couldn't. Of course, not long after I left he finally proposed to her and they got married. It's screwed up to realize that the reason your stepfather didn't marry your mom is because he wanted a shot at you first.\n\nAnyway, this is way longer than I meant it to be but the point is that everyone who meets this asshole LOVES him. They do not know who he is. Just that he's personable and relatively smart. But I never forget that first night when for no apparent reason I just felt sick at the thought of him.\n\n\nEdit: There is an update post somewhere in the comments. It was too long for me to post here so I just did it as a reply. The TL;DR is no I'm not with that boyfriend anymore but we were together 7 years. Yes, Mom is still with this asshole but I never see him. She's afraid to leave him but now that it's just the two of them she sees it as her being the only one who has to tolerate his crap and she's willing to do that for what she sees as financial security. She visits by herself and no one questions why we don't go visiting there.",

She was always complaining about money issues, but then would go out for meals or come into work with new clothes that were not indicative of someone with severe money problems.  She allegedly complained of such severe financial problems that she was telling people she was having trouble putting food on the table for her kids.  It was that level of desperation.  Everyone really liked her, I didn't.  I had a really odd feeling about her, like she was being constantly deceptive.\n\nPeople would always help her out, either by giving her gift-cards to Target, extra clothes or canned food.  \n\nShe also complained of car issues for a period of several months.  This wonderfully kind lady at work - \"C\" - let M borrow her car during the workday.  This was so that M could use whatever money she said she had to go to the store and buy food for her family.  Additionally, she used C's car to take a nap from time to time.  She claimed to work another evening job and she was often very tired.\n\nEvery year, our company sponsored a local family that needed a lot of help.  We were a small business at the time (<50 employees) and we'd all donate something to the family at Christmas.  It was usually toys, clothes, gift cards and so forth.  This year, we decided as a group to my silent opposition that M would be our \"family\" this particular year.  We amassed close to $1,100 worth of food, toys and clothes and presented it to M before Christmas that year.  She cried, and said thank you.\n\nThree months later, C's car was stolen right out of the employee parking lot.  Coincidentally, M didn't report back to work that day after lunch.  Long story short, M had made a copy of C's car key at some point and stole the car and drove out of state with the intent to flee and not return. We had come to learn that M had a long history of criminal charges, and M was eventually arrested in a traffic stop after C reported the car stolen.  \n\nAs it turned out, M was a financial criminal, specializing in identity theft.  She had swindled many people, and had a long criminal history including multiple felonies.  \n\nRight from the beginning, I knew something was up with her that I didn't like, but I couldn't put a real finger on it. I don't know why I saw it and no one else did.  I actually began to question my morals, asking myself \"Why do I dislike M when everyone else does not?\" I wrestled with it personally for some time, but in a weird way felt vindicated when the truth revealed itself.\n\nEdit: just fixed a few typos.",

She then complained to my friends that I didnt add her. My friends said to me \"aw but she's nice, give her a chance!\" but I remained suspicious. The red flags followed: \n\n- I was recording Joe's band's album. Joe was late to sessions twice because Marnie had called him at midnight, crying about their breakup from 10 years ago and threatening suicide. Not only is that a shitty thing to do, but Marnie was very much aware when Joe was recording - he was posting about it on social media. These weren't very frequent, maybe one session a week. Interesting timing. We had to cancel and reschedule because Joe was so exhausted from dealing with her. (yes, he should've refused to deal with her but she shouldnt have bothered him in the first place).\n\n-When we finished recording, Joe, the band and some friends and I had drinks and Marnie showed up. We got onto the topic of what we look for in an ideal partner. Marnie said, \"Well it was Joe but that didnt work out HAHAHA. HA. HAAAA.\" It was so awkward that everyone suddenly made excuses to leave and go home.\n\n- I organised an outdoor event in our town. My friends, including Joe, said they would come. The event didnt actually start til 12pm and my friends said on on my FB event page that they'd arrive at around 1pm. I was there from 9am to set up. As I walked around the site, I passed Marnie about three times. Just stalking up and down the event site, glaring at nothing with her serial killer eyes for 4 hours until Joe showed up. I chose to ignore her, because WTF.\n\n- Finally... Joe had a gig to release the album. We got drunk and merry at the gig and rolled down to a nearby cockrail bar to have a celebratory fancy martini. Joe was the most shitfaced and was on cloud nine after a great gig and some album sales. Suddenly, Joe realised he forgot his keys or something so he announced that he was heading back to the gig venue. Marnie FLIPPED HER SHIT screaming about Joe being too drunk and irresponsible and then started  detailing his rather personal mental health issues from high school. Like, shrieking about self-harm in the middle of this little cocktail bar playing soft jazz on a Saturday night with people nibbling on soft cheeses. Joe wisely decided to just leave. Marnie stomped after him, slamming the bar door. My friends and I, worried that Marnie might actually murder Joe, chased after her down the main street of our town. Marnie kept calling Joe to unleash primal, gutteral screams of rage into her phone. \"WHERE ARE YOU? AAAAGH! AASAAGHJFHKXGHFJHDDH!!!!!!\" People around us looked afraid.\n \nWe got to Joe before her, who had found his keys and was having a relaxing sit-down backstage, threw him in a taxi and dispersed, leaving Marnie alone. \n\n\"I cant believe she did that!\" gasped my friends.\n\"I can,\" I said.\n\nJoe finally grew some balls and cut off Marnie and we didnt hear from her again. Until a year later when Joe started dating a new girl. They werent official when the new girl quietly asked me, \"Do you know someone named Marnie? I dont know who she is but she messaged me, said she knows Joe and wants to talk. I'm worried.\"\n\nTl;dr - friend's psycho clinger high school ex ruins everything",

If there was ever a stereotype for serial killers this guy fucking nailed it. Everyone else had passed him off as a sweet, sheltered young guy who didn't realize he was kind of strange. I did too until we started talking one night and he admitted to me he had serious, serious, anger issues. Black outs and the like. Gets into our group of friends at work and starts kind of obsessing over one of our female coworkers. Everyone passes it off as a crush, I knew better, she rejected him, wasn't pretty but he played the let's be friends card. So me and my buddy were super tight with this chick, she starts telling us he's saying things behind our backs trying to make it look like we were talking about her, obviously trying to separate us, I'm not fooled. Couple months go by, things calm a bit, we're still being nice to the guy, invite him to go hiking with my buddy, my little brother, and I; dude shows up to the trail with a fucking COMBAT machete, his buck knife, a slingshot IIRC, and looking like we're about to play The Most Dangerous Game. Both my Bros pass it off as enthusiasm for the hike, I'm warry, I pick up a strong walking stick and begin carving it into a spear as we walk, psycho notices and looks upset, like I've inconvenienced him, and then asks if we all want to come to his \"secret spot, it's only 12 miles into the trail and off the path by a little bit\", my little brother was fat, and we only had one bottle of water between us all in a Southern Summer, I tell him we cant, then he starts insisting my buddy go with him and he was almost about to until I dropped our code phrase and gesture to bail (always have one or a few of these with your friends), he says he's coming with me and that's when I saw the look in Psychos eyes, rage. He drew his machete and stepped towards my friend as he turned his back, so I stepped towards him with my spear, he saw me and shot off this smile and a laugh and said he'd go alone, then stepped off the trail into the woods and disappeared, I know he was watching us as we left because I told my buddy to take my little brother and stay at least 10 yards in front of me, and the entire time I could hear twigs snapping behind us.\n\nTo wrap it up, we all survived, but it wasn't long after that when Psycho started stalking our coworker, showing up at random times, and discarding dead animals on her property, she complained along with a dozen people not long after that and he was fired. But not before he attacked her at work and had his ass beat. Don't know what happened to him after that, don't really want to.\n\n",

He takes care of his people, always gets the good projects for them, makes sure they get a good cut of the yearly salary increase, etc, etc.\n\nThe day I started was his last day before he went on a 2-3 week vacation.  So I only met him briefly and walked away from that with plenty of anxiety.  Something was just off with this guy.  But, again, everyone loved him.  People that had known him for years.  What did I know?\n\nOver the course of the next year, people were just giving this guy a hand job at every turn.  I didn't get it.  We got along fine, but I made sure to keep my hand on my own dick.  After a while, I'd start to voice my concerns a bit to some of my coworkers.  I was treated as an outcast and some of his bigger fanboys were outright hostile at times.\n\nSo... fast forward a few years and, to my knowledge, I was the only one of ~100 people that ever voiced anything but absolute admiration for the guy.  Then things started unravelling.  Let's see...\n\n* Turns out he was fucking the wives of two of his employees.  Rumour has it also someone's daughter, but I'm not so sure about that.  And, I guess he left them with a lifelong gift that keeps on giving.\n* He was, for years, regularly stealing from the company.  I'd heard somewhere north of $1M all up.  I'm sure that's probably an accurate number.\n* He would regularly go on longer-term (3+ week) vacations.  We find out it was because he was a serial DUI'er and was in jail/rehab 2-3 times a year.  This was long before online records, so nobody ever knew.  \n* He frequently beat his wife and kids.  Again, pre-online world, so nobody really had any way of knowing.  One of his sons has some type of permanent vision problem because of a beating.\n* He finally hit someone while drunk so had a trial.  It was a family member of someone prominent in the community, so it got some press.  That was how we all became aware of he's the real deal.  Anyway, he goes to trial and is convicted.  They had a sentencing hearing and the victim and family members said their piece.  Then this guys family (his father, a sister and a nephew) got up to, we think, support him.  Wrong.  All three of them begged the judge to give him the max sentence.  They spoke of him stealing from family, massive drug/alcohol abuse, hinted at raping family members, on and on.  The judge gave him 3 years and I think he was out in ~6 months.\n\nThe insane thing is that some of his fanboys hoped that he'd be hired back to his job when he was released.  People were jockeying to position themselves back on his team if he was rehired.  I noped right on out of there at that point. ",

Anyways she started saying a lot of things that the family first were concerned about but would shrug off because when it starts happening that much to someone you love you don't want to even accept they are going crazy. She kept saying my dad always had a red face when he got home from work and started accusing him of cheating. My dad was always busy and always had airtight reasons to where he was with evidence and my mom just seemed more nuts. She then hired a private detective which costs thousands and the whole family got pissed because this guy didn't find anything. She then hired another one and everyone was starting to get really really angry when this one discovered the whole time my dad was cheating. My mom didn't even brag about how we thought she was crazy she just only cared about how it affected us kids. Best person I knew.\n",

    "body": "My friend met this guy and after a few weeks they got closer / started to entertain the idea of dating. She told me he was previously in a relationship (less than 1 month broken up) and he was 28 and lives with mom and dad in basement - spends all his money on tattoos and his truck kinda guy. \nShe also has an ex who warned her about this guy. Says he is strange and \"not right\". She put it off as ex is jealous, decides to not pay any mind to what he has to say. One summer day we decide to go to a baseball game. All of us (my boyfriend and I included) got a hotel room. Go to the game, tailgate, have fun with a huge group of people but I notice he's not very social with anyone more so just watching her. We are in his truck right before the game and he starts to say weird shit that is just very protective (they've been \"dating\" about 2 weeks) and making me feel uncomfortable \"If that guy tries to hit on you let me know I'll break his arms\". Everyone proceeds to get drunk, we go into the game. They just disappear from this group of 15 people without saying a word. Later that night my boyfriend and I go back to the hotel it's deadbolted, we knock... he answers completely naked. We're confused. Boyfriend tells me grab my things and we're going home. Crazy proceeds to jump back on her to have sex and she was giggling/laughing I assume not noticing us in the dark room??? I really don't have an explanation. Most uncomfortable thing I've ever seen or experienced in my life. \nFast forward 2 weeks... (dating a total of 1 month) \nHe flips out calling and texting her because she's out with friends male and female at the bar (they live 1 hour apart) he starts saying things like he's going to kill himself, how he wishes he could make her happy. She doesn't respond because she thinks it's childish so he turns around and starts to say how she is a slut, whore, should kill herself... yeah I told her to run as fast as she could. \nHe continued to contact her for about 2 months until she blocked him on everything. He came up on my news feed about three months after she blocked him and got the ex he was dating pregnant and now they live in his moms basement with a newborn. Fun stuff. ",

I was best man at their wedding and when i gave my speech I wasn't able to really mention her at all because I just didn't think she was a good person.\n\nI never told anyone this. We lived on different sides of the country so by the time they were getting married I had only met her a few times.\n\nI was immediately struck with her being superficial and selfish. I don't think she really did anything to warrant that but I guess throughout my years of dating superficial and selfish people I've learned to hear their dog whistle. There's a loud siren going off when a girl's largest asset is being pretty. They live in a different world but eventually the real one catches up to them and, having always had things handed to them because they're pretty, they blame everyone else for the shock of reality when they start getting treated like everyone else. Recognizing this,  I just plain didn't like her, didn't want to be around her but I was glad my brother found someone that made him happy so how I felt didn't matter.\n\nFast forward only about a year and she turns abusive. My brother was woken up several times to her punching him. Spitting on him. His crimes were wanting to have a few hours to himself each week to watch football. Finally she grows to hate that his life doesn't revolve around her so much that she moves out. She quits paying her half of the mortgage and won't talk to him. He begins marriage counseling but she won't go so he goes alone. He tries talking to her only to have her parents block his attempts. Finally, having been in this situation before myself, I tell him what I think is happening. She met someone else. Someone she probably even told him about causally because she's obsessed with the new car smell.\n\nHedidn't believe it. I told him to just look at their phone bill. Sure enough a number jumps out. Hundreds of texts and hours of calls at like midnight and later. Sorry people but married people don't talk to friends that long, that often and that late. They're cheating.\n\nSo he finds out who it is. It's some married guy with kids she mentioned is getting divorced. \"We're just friends talking about our problems\".\n\nEventually she shows up to get some things. My brother tells her sorry, you don't get to skip mortgage payments for 6 months and then just show up like you own the place. So she hits him. So he finally calls the cops cuz she said she's gong to tell the police he raped her. She goes to jail for domestic abuse and he files for divorce soon after.\n\nSoon after their divorce, I find out that she has married that other guy. A few years has passed since this and i guarantee they're divorced.\n\nNever trust a girl whose biggest asset is her looks. ",

    "body": "I'll throw in a couple little wholesome twists to this prompt! \n\n1. Took my baby niece shopping with me one day when she was maybe a little over 1 yrs. She's a sweet kid, but not one of those that's overly outgoing. \n\nAnyways, we end up shopping next to your stereotypical biker-gang looking guy in his 40s or 50s. He's just minding his own business, but my niece kept eyeballing him and smiling. After a few moments of this he gave in and kind of showed a sideways grin. When I gave him a friendly smile back, he walked over to us. \n\nHe started doing sweet baby talk to my niece and proceeded to show me pictures of his grandkids. Sweetest guy ever. My heart melted. \n\nI know not to judge a book by it's cover from experience, but I absolutely love that little ones don't even have the concept of race, religion, sexual orientation, etc. - they just see people!\n\n2. Friend and I had just picked up a box of pizza and stopped to get gas. We live in a town where there's a decent amount of homeless people so it's not at all uncommon to see or interact with one. We've both had good an bad experiences with them, so neither of us are opposed to helping, but we also don't go out of our way to do it. \n\nOne of the homeless guys was pretty much just doing his one thing, but gave us a kind smile as we walked past him. Clearly homeless, but wasn't pushing us for anything. As we were in the car about to leave my friend says \"that one homeless guy stood out to me for some reason, do you mind if we give him a slice of pizza?\" I told her I thought that was a wonderful idea, but was honestly a little apprehensive it might open an uncomfortable door. \n\nWe pulled up next to him and offered a slice, he was so happy and asked if he could have 2, which we let him. \n\nAt first I couldn't decide if I felt like \"Really? Beggars can't be choosers, dude\" or kinda bittersweet that 2 slices was a luxury. \n\nThen he walked over to his homeless friend and gave him the other slice. They both gave us the biggest, genuine grins and waves as we drove away. My heart exploded. She admitted she was a bit skeptical of offering at first, but she said she just had this feeling that she'd regret if she didn't offer him one. \n\nIt seems like we're born with pretty good instincts about people, both good and bad. These stories just seem to support we should trust our guts, whether it's that your \"perfect neighbor\" is actually a creep, or that the \"scary\" tattooed thug is actually one of the nicest people you'll ever meet. \n\n\nTLDR - \n1. Baby niece keeps smiling at \"scary biker dude\" who ends up being a sweet grandpa\n\n2. Friend gets out of ordinary feeling to offer food to homeless guy, who ends up sharing with his friend",

    "body": "Yup. First was a dude who seemed way too interested in me and tried to contact me way too often right from the beginning. I went out with him only few times, everyone else thought he was a good catch. I first became suspicious when I added a photo to instagram while studying in a library and he showed up a few ~~years~~ hours later, just casually saying he came to see friends or something else equally lame as an excuse (he lived two hours away). Finally had the confirmation to my uneasy feelings about him when I stayed home from a party because I was sick. He excepted me to come and seemed upset when I told him I'm staying home, sent me many messages. I went to take the trash outside and guess who was there, in his car, staring me like the creepy stalker he was (later accidentally found out from my neighbor it wasn't  the first time). In a perfect place where he apparently watched me the whole evening instead of being at the party. When I said I never want to see him again he was really persistently aggressive for a long time until he finally backed out.\n\n\nSecond was my friend's boyfriend when we were 16. He was really popular, even though he wasn't really good looking he was extremely charming in a strange way. But people were just drawn to him, every single time I saw him it was him in the spotlight, telling a story, a joke, pouring a drink, whatever (I mostly saw him at parties or in big groups when they went out together with my friend). He was unusually generous (his parent's were very wealthy) and funny. He instantly became a hit in our friend group, especially among the guys. At the end it went basically that my friend had isolated herself from us and her boyfriend stayed friends with the guys, and they seemed to be more interested of him than her anyway.\n\n\n From the moment I met him I was uncomfortable of how he was almost too friendly, he wanted to have a super deep conversation like 30 minutes after we met first time at a party, asked me some really personal questions and was somehow too interested about my life, but the thing that made me upset was that he made _constant_ remarks of my looks, complimenting me in a way that was just in the line of being inappropriate but not there yet, comparing me and my friend. Over time he started doing this more loudly, with other people hearing (not just me, other girls in general). Basically \"joking\" about my friend and her flaws in front of everyone, telling \"funny\" embarrassing stories of her. If she tried to say anything, he told her she was way too sensitive, it was just  a joke etc. He started flirting shamelessly with other girls in front of her.\n\n\n\nUnfortunately one time I said what I think of him to his face, he got really mad, she took his side and was really angry to me, I lost all contact with her for almost 3 years. It wasn't just me though, she lost basically every friend she had and he started going out alone, her being alone at home. Before that incident happened I did have many conversation with her and tried to be extremely careful when talking with her about him, but she was always somehow so guarded and basically complaining about him, then apologizing in his behalf and excusing his behavior, blaming herself out of everything etc. But it was clear that they had a very toxic relationship. He was manically controlling, insanely jealous (he had _all_ her passwords, went through her social media accounts before forcing her to take all them down, went apeshit if she just looked at another guy in a wrong way), mean, belittling her all the time. Also it turned out later he cheated basically the whole time since day one.\n\n\n\nI later heard from mutual friends it finally ended when her dad saw the marks he had done (he was violent, to my knowledge he wasn't when I still was friends with her, it came later) and went apeshit. Forced her to go the police, took her to live with him, forced her to cut all contact. He terrorized her for a long time after that, for example threatened to kill her dog.\n\n\nI still kinda miss our friendship, we both apologized to each other and get back in touch later but somehow it just wasn't the same anymore. We tried for a while but it just died out eventually when we both had our own lives to live. It was clear that she went through some severe emotional trauma, everything from the way she laughed (he said it was annoying when she laughed too loud) to her looks changed when she was with him.\n\n\nI feel kinda uneasy writing these things since my reddit account is supposed to be anonymous and I fear someone I know reads these. Oh well whatever.",

    "body": "In my senior year of high school, I took an elective economics class - a notoriously easy A at our school. The teacher was stereotypically \"cool\", he coached girls basketball and wore polo shirts with the collar popped, had a mini fridge in his class, and generally didn't give a shit.\n\nHe was popular, especially with the jocks as he didn't even try to hide his favoritism for them. Girls on his team could help themselves from the fridge, they didn't have to come to class, and basically got to fuck around all day. His daughter was on the team, and he gave off a real \"trying to be the cool dad\" vibe.\n\nI didn't like him, mostly because I was the opposite of cool and wasn't very fond of jocks. I thought it was bullshit that he got away with being a shit teacher just because he coached sports, but since I wasn't exactly the studious type I wasn't going to complain, either.\n\nI was sitting in class while he bantered flirtatiously with some of the basketball players, and thought \"I bet he's fucking them\" and immediately felt guilty because I knew how easy it was for a rumor to ruin someone's life - another wonderful teacher of mine had almost lost his license over a false accusation. \n\nWell. Guess what I read in the paper over Christmas break? The teacher had indeed been fucking one of his basketball girls - in fact, his daughter's best friend. 15 years old. \n\nWith just a few weeks til the end of the semester, a substitute teacher administered the final exam that had already been written by the original guy, now sitting in jail. You know how in a multiple choice test, they'll sometimes give you three plausible choices and one ridiculous choice? His questions all had three ridiculous choices and one very obvious answer. \n\nIt eventually came out that the administration had received reports of his relationship with the girl, but didn't act of on them. It was incredible how much he got away with just because of his value to the athletics department.\n\nI just googled it and found a link to the case where they sued the school for not acting on the reports.

    "body": "Yes -- I used to be an administrator of a college radio station, and there was this guy who came in and immediately charmed everyone via his looks and charisma. Only a good friend of mine who also was on staff there (who worked with him years prior at a different company) and I were put-off by him, because something seemed... off. I was civil but I kept things at arm's length, especially after I was publicly snubbed by him when he was passing out invitations to his wedding (which, sucks for him, I give *awesome* gifts).\n\nFast forward to the next summer: I'm moving internationally and will be leaving my position; however, the next person to take my job was out of state for the summer, so I offered to continue as acting administrator until I left (which would coincide to around the time of the new guy's return). The charmer, at this point, also had gained a position of authority. He almost immediately dropped the facade of friendliness and began blatantly manipulating the entire station to change from a music station to a sports/talk format, which everyone acquiesced to because the general manager had a crush on him, which he exploited despite being married. When I tried to call him out on this being a very bad idea, he screamed at me in front of the entire board (the only reason I didn't scream right back was because I was dealing with a brutal stomach bug and didn't much feel like vomiting by raising my voice), and the board just let him get away with it. So, despite my protests, the station began emphasizing sports and talk. I leave and wash my hands of the situation; they didn't listen to my judgment once before and the station tanked (which is another story entirely), so I was going to let this play out.\n\nThree months after I've moved, I come to find out that the station has, so far, received multiple FCC complaints, gotten listener complaints, cut back on decades-long flagship music shows with huge followings in favour of live to air sports broadcasts, and had gotten the budget frozen due to negligence, a good chunk of which was due to this guy's incompetence and the GM's passivity to it.\n\nThat was four years ago; the station (which is one of my babies, given how much time I've put into it) is *still* recovering, all because of one smarmy douche.

    "body": "This will get buried and that's not a big deal, it's a pretty minor story.\n\nI work overnights at a gas station.  One night like two years ago this guy comes in and I instantly dislike him.  Just like immediate gut feeling 'this guy and I will not get along'... He had just moved into the area, and started coming to the store regurally.  He made friends with some of my co-workers, he is an aspiring DJ and artist, he smokes a ton of weed all the time, and overall is still just your everyday average chill stoner wannabe hippy guy.  I still didn't like him.\n\nCut to like a year into it, he gets a puppy.  The dog is cute as shit, and I don't mind the puppy being in the store because come on, I'm not going to kick out a puppy.  As the dog grows up my patience gets a little more thin, and I ask him not to bring the dog in, it's store policy, etc etc etc...  Of course as soon as I bring it up, he says it's a service dog.  My bullshit detector goes off, but I figure I'll ask my co-workers about it since they're friends.  All my co-workers tell me he's just calling it a service dog so he can bring him wherever he wants (like concerts and downtown bars and such).\n\nI still let it go for a few months because in truth it isn't a big deal, and I generally don't TRY to look for arguments with people.  Then one night he comes in and a different person is holding the dogs leash, and that was the line for me.  If you're going to claim that as a service dog, you damn well better know the rules you're breaking.\n\nI ask them to leave the dog outside, he says no way that's a service dog, he doesn't have to... I say no man, you need to be in control of the dog... So he just grabs the leash and says 'what now'... I say well what service is that dog trained to do?  (FYI that's literally the only question I can ask regarding service animals... I'm not asking about his disability, simply what the dog will be doing in the store).  He refuses to answer, says I can't ask that question, threatens lawsuits, gets extremely angry over this...  So I ask him and his crew to leave, which he does with a nice flipping of the bird and homophobic slur to cap it all off.\n\nSo he goes to my boss and complains.  My boss comes to me and says hey, it's not a big deal, we don't want trouble, just don't talk to him anymore than you have to.  And my boss is probably right.  I don't like it because the argument turned personal against me and we have the right to refuse service to assholes no matter what, but whatever, he wins his little fight and I continue to sell him stuff for another week.\n\nThen he goes back to my boss and says 'you know what, that's actually not good enough anymore.  My civil rights were violated, and I'm going to demand that you fire the guy who kicked me out of the store and I want a settlement of $50,000 or else I'll sue'...  So my boss comes to me and says \"yeah you were right, that guy is a dick...  I banned him from the store, if he comes in just say he's not allowed in and call the police if he doesn't leave\"\n\nAnd I didn't see or hear about him again for 6 months until last week.\n\nHe broke into somebodies house as part of a robbery and stabbed a dude.  I wonder if jail allows service dogs.",

    "body": "Well, this actually happened recently.\n\nI'm a Chef.  I have my Red Seal, my Food Safe, diploma, etc.  I got it all.  I have my B.Sc as well through a top University in Canada.  \n\nI have been doing sales for my employers, including procurement and purchasing, but they've been having trouble with their restaurant recently, so they asked me to check in and report to them (they are largely a grocer, but have one restaurant to promote their organics).  The Chef at the restaurant was well liked by the staff.  Everyone always talked to him and enjoyed his presence it seemed.  He talked a lot about sports, and was respectful to the women in the dining room.    \n\nBut me... I didn't like him the second I met him.  He was sitting on a milk crate while looking at his phone.  The line was dead, but it was disorganized, messy, and the food quality was substandard.  The cooks ran the kitchen, not the Chef. \n\nI took a look at the other stuff -- specifically the finish of the risotto, the stews, the steak cuts, the salmon and white fish cuts, etc.  They were not cut properly.  I found a prime rib, still bagged, that had been sitting in its own blood for what was obviously quite some time.  If you're going to age a Prime Fucking Rib, you take it out of the bag and clean the blood off of it before racking it.  I asked about it -- he just looked at me as if to say: \"Who the fuck are you to ask?\"  He had no idea who I was, just some sales guy, right?  \n\nWell no.  Part of the reason why I stepped away from the kitchen was to pick up more experience in the procurement and sales industry - I wanted a better understanding of the procurement sector of the restaurant and food industry.  I worked in various competitions, did five years under a well-known Chef in Toronto, spent even more years running a restaurant / night club when I was in school, and afterwards.  I worked in Taste of Danforth, Toronto, and volunteered for huge non-profit organizations.  \n\nSo yea, I'm the guy you want looking into this shit because you can't do your own job, dickhead.\n\nI stuck around for a few hours to watch the line rush.  Not once did the Chef actually help anyone on the line.  Food wasn't being plated consistently, a 14oz steak was sent back for not being cooked properly, tables weren't being properly timed for sending out, and the Chef just continued to sit on that fucking milk crate.  I dug into the finances.  In this scratch kitchen, food wastage shouldn't be more than maybe 20%. with some potential to drop even more. This was at ~40%.  I couldn't believe it.  In the one day I was there, I saw so much food being thrown out from the kitchen staff that I damn near blew up.  \n\nNext day, I reported everything.  They asked me to take over ASAP until they can get a new Chef.  I agreed, after some negotiation over salary, which I managed to turn into a wage.  I've already done 65 hours this week, and I'm about to log in 15 more.  Now to fire his ass.  \n\nBut wait.  There's more.  A couple of the servers were terrified of this guy.  He was reportedly harassing them and the supervisor / bar manager wasn't reporting it.  He would spend hours in the office, and the same day I came in, he was caught beating off to something in the office.  \n\nThe next day after I was tasked to take over, I was called.  He didn't show up for work.  I started looking into his background.  He's never been a Chef.  He falsified references, experience, education, etc.  His address was fake.  His phone number was fake (so how the fuck did anyone get a hold of him?).  He started calling into the restaurant and asking for a couple of the girls' email or phone number.  \n\nThis guy simply just vanished.  \n\nThis incident caused a lot of ruffled feathers.  One of the HR managers was fired for dereliction of duty.  The bar manager was fired.  I just fired three cooks, the Sous Chef, hired three more cooks (no Sous Chef yet), and threw myself into this.  Right now, this is the first morning I have had in over a month (not including Family Day), that I have been able to sit at home and post on Reddit from my PC.  \n\nSo I guess I'm the Chef now.  ",

He was reaching out for tips on how to communicate with her. My wife explained to him you marry someone for who they are, not what you'll think they'll become. He didn't like that advice. My wife called up her friend and read her the email and asked her what the fuck is up with this guy. Her friend was pissed that he reached out to my wife instead of communicating directly to him, and called him out on it. They got in a huge fight, and then he flipped it on my wife saying if she didn't share his private email with her they wouldn't be having this fight. Then he accused us of meddling in his relationship. Real narcissistic shit. She was letting him manipulate the reality of the situation. \n\nMonths go by with no communication from either of them. My wife is getting very concerned for her, so she reached out. They planned a girls weekend up by her. So my wife drives the 3 hours to her house, they go to dinner, drink wine, and talk. My wife reiterated exactly what happened because she totally saw it from his view and forgot the facts. Her friend was starting to see what was going on. She was getting upset. He was calling her obsessively they whole time they were at dinner, she kept sending him to voicemail. When dinner was over my wife went to her friends house to spend the night. He was supposed to be out of town. This guy shows up and starts screaming at both his wife and my wife. My wife doesn't take shit, so she gave him a verbal Ass whipping. Her friend kicked the guy out and my wife came home. After I found out this guy yelled at my wife, I reached out to him and explained if he ever talked to my wife like that again, I will be taking a trip up there and it would not be friendly. \n\nWe haven't heard from them in a few days. My wife calls her friend to see if she's okay. Her friend starts screaming at her saying why did you talk to my husband that way, and your husband threatened my husband. Just a totally different person than she left her. He twisted the story again and made it like we were out to get him. \n\nThe scariest thing about psychological abuse is that it makes the victim a shell of who they were. Constant gas lighting makes the victim feel like they're crazy. \n\nMy wife is tenacious. She loves her friend. She never gave up trying to have a relationship. They spoke amicably, but never spoke of their relationship. Then her Facebook posts became very strange. Every update was an update about what she did that day. No matter how mundane the task was, it was posted. You could bet, every day at around 5pm there was a status of her day, what time she woke up, what time she went to work, her food intake etc. My wife was having one of her surface calls with her and got right to the point and asked her why she was making her everyday tasks public on social media. She explained (after bringing down her wall) that her husband wanted her to be more productive. He felt like she wasn't doing enough. She had a full time job and when she got home she wanted to veg out and watch television. He wouldn't let her. She was becoming what he wanted. An obedient servant. \n\nShe used to come to our house to visit. He never came because he knew we didn't like him, and there was always a good hour before she put her guard down and relaxed. We were having some drinks and she got into the topic of sex. She was saying to my wife how bad it sucks to be a wife and be forced to have sex every day even though she doesn't want to. We explained to her that it was called rape. That being married does not mean you are someone's sex toy. That was the last straw. We told her she was being emotionally abused. We showed her websites explaining what he was doing to her. And just like last time, she felt empowered, went home, didn't speak to her for a few days, and when called to follow up, he convinced her that we were meddling. \n\nAt this point my wife reached out to her family and her other friends but he had them fooled. They thought she was overreacting. We looked like the assholes. He did such a good job of manipulating everyone that he was some kind of great guy. Always quick to help out and go the extra mile if he KNEW someone was watching. We felt helpless. \n\nOne summer a bunch of us rented a lake house. They went, and we figured we'd be amicable and not ruin everyone's vacation.  There was 5 couples including us and them. We all went swimming and her friend went to take a shower. He went to the house about ten minutes after her, and we all went to grab some snacks. When we entered the house we heard him screaming at her for not telling him he was taking a shower. We all heard it. Finally other people saw the monster we saw. When he realized he was exposed, he made her leave the vacation early. \n\nNow that other people saw the real person he was, his control of her communication to the outside world was full throttle. No one heard from her. She never answered calls. We were concerned. \n\nThe greatest thing that could ever happen to her was he upgraded their phones. She was at home cleaning the house using the old phone to listen to music on Spotify. She kept hearing messages dinging. She checked the messages and saw that he was talking to a girl. Sending dick picks. Telling her how his wife treats him like shit and he's a victim. That did it. She woke up. She confronted him with it, and he said it was her fault for not giving her enough sex. They just got a divorce and he is living with the girl he was talking to starting the cycle all over again. She is going to therapy to undo all the damage he did. \n\nTLDR: We knew this guy was no good, and he psychologically abused my wife's best friend \n\nPS: psychological abuse is real. It's hard to prove because there are no bruises. It is also hard to prove to the abused that they are being abused. \n\n",

Everybody liked the guy, including my whole family and I. I was only 8-12 when I knew him but he was very kind to me and would even let me practice with the team even though I was four years younger. \n\nMy family had a old golden retriever at the time that did nothing but sleep, shit, and eat with the occasional walk around the living room to get a good back scratch. I grew up with him since he was a pup and I never saw him be aggressive to anyone or any other animals besides a few squirrels when he was young.\n\nOne day this soccer coach came over to our house to chat with my dad, who was an assistant coach, and my brother about an upcoming tournament. As soon as he walked in the door our old golden went ballistic. I had never seen him act this way. We had to hold him back from going Cujo on him. He never entered our house because of him.\n\nA year later, this man was sentenced life in prison for first degree premeditated murder of his wife. \n\nThis obviously could have been an odd coincidence but I like to think that our old pup was protecting us from a very bad man that we couldn't see from the outside.

    "body": "When I was 12 there was this girl in our class, she was bubbly and popular but I felt something about her was off. I remember standing by my locker and literally telling my best friend: \"I don't trust her. I don't think we should be friends with her.\"\n\n\nBut my best friend did end up befriending her throughout the school year and consequently I became friendly with her as well. Fast forward to the second half of the following school year and she has completely manipulated students and teachers alike not to like me. I was a very shy easygoing kid then, and it absolutely destroyed me that I thought I had done something wrong. She did a lot of hurtful things I won't get into right now.\n\n\nShe was a bully, but bullying happens so I didn't think anything of it. My mother had me transferred to another class to get away from the toxic environment, I had blocked everyone I knew from the old class and that was supposed to be the end of it. \n\n\nBut it wasn't. Over the next couple of years she harassed me, called me with other people's phones, had other people call me to hear me out about anything and everything.\nOne day I came home, walked into the living room and two of her friends had gotten into the house by lying to my parents about being good friends with me, and they were waiting for me.\n\n\nThe thing is though, these two girls lived 2 hours away. These 14 year old girls had taken the train and travelled 2 hours to lie their way into my home, just because this girl said I deserved it somehow. \n\n\nShe would also walk past my bedroom window at odd hours and just stand there for a while on more than one occasion. \n\n\nBecause we were both 14 year olds nobody took me seriously. I kept changing my phone numbers and she would somehow find it every single time. Apparently she had also stalked an ex boyfriend when she was 16 or 17 and gone hysterical over something weird I don't remember.\n\n\nI'm now 22 and I've moved away a couple of years ago. I haven't heard from her since I was 18, but I'm still wary of any of her friends because she's weird. And I fucking knew it.",

    "body": "One of my best guy friends had this girlfriend whom I didn't hate exactly. We were acquaintances and I thought she was nice on the surface, nothing more than that. For some reason I didn't really want to get to know her too well. Just something off-putting... For example, she would say things like \"Oh when I see someone that needs help, I just have to help them!\" All the power to her but I personally never found it to charming when people bragged about how much of an Angel they were another example was, \"Cat's just love me for some reason! When I was at this farm all the stray cats crowded around me and they didn't do that with anyone else!\u201d Anyways that wasn't anything serious but the little things and quirks just wasn't my taste I suppose. (Most good people don\u2019t brag about their good deeds)\n\n\n\n\nSo one day my friend who has been taking caring of his jobless girlfriend for over a year now, paying for her housing, food, medication etc. calls me and asks me to buy some Plan-B because she got raped by a stranger. I do so, and head over to their apartment. She's hiding in the bathtub with blankets and he says that she needs a girl to talk to, and if I could spend some time with her. As a favor to my friend I do and spend hours with her until she feels better. Story she told us was that she went over to a friend\u2019s house. Her friend had a roommate had a friend who raped her (also she was against going to the police because they wouldn\u2019t do shit she said). So I say that if she needs someone to talk to she can call me however I sleep from 9 am - 5 pm (because I work night shifts at a hospital)\n\n\n\n\n1 Week later she says that it wasn't some stranger who raped her but her actual friend whom she previously had a crush on; she lied because she was scared of the outcome. (I am assuming she didn\u2019t want to rat out her friend to the police)\n\n\n\n\nFast forward another week. I've talked to her a couple times but one day she calls me at 10 am. I sleep through my phone. Another call at 12pm. I miss it but wake up enough to text her, asking \"What\u2019s wrong\u201d I don't get a reply and fall back asleep. Another call at 2pm, slept through that one too. I wake up around 5 pm and see all these missed calls, she still hasn't replied to me yet so I inform her boyfriend that I've gotten a few missed calls from her. After that she hated me because I wasn't there for her...\n\n\n\n\nAlmost a month flies by now and my guy friend is starting to get really stressed out with financial issues, he was 20k in debt before he met her and it\u2019s now doubled that. According to my friend she doesn\u2019t do chores but is at home all day or smoking medical weed with friends, doesn\u2019t put in effort to find a job because it stresses her out too much, constantly is mad and complains about the apartment being a mess, pull out her hair in rage and arguments etc. I asked if he could get family to help out or anything but his girlfriend doesn\u2019t want him to tell his family anything. His family thought she\u2019s an angel at this point because they haven\u2019t heard of how they are actually doing. \n\n\n\n\nAfter a ton of arguments and some on and off again relationship time he finally kicked her out of his apartment. To be picked up by friend who had raped her... Many of our mutual friends (very good people) have taken up the responsibility of listening to her problems and have had the unfortunate time of being yelled at by her as well. They didn\u2019t know that side of her before.\n\n\n\n\n\nSide note: she owes me 60 bucks for that Plan B still.\n\n\n\n\nEdit: Spelling/Grammar errors\n",

    "body": "I actually have had this happen quite a few times. But the first two were the worst: #1) My mom started dating a guy when I was four or so and I hated him, he came across as dangerous to me. She ignored me, until he started getting violent. She dumped him, but the next night he came over and was trying to force his way into our house and shouting threats about torture and death. We called 911 but he would disappear when the cops showed up, and start again when they left - this went on all night and I was terrified. #2) About a year and a half later she got another boyfriend. I got an even stronger bad feeling about him, but again she ignored me. He seemed nice at first, and even convinced my mom to go on an \"long camping trip\" with me in tow, she agreed as there were others going; We \"camped\" for over six months, I missed school. He quickly got aggressive, especially toward me. He made me eat raw snake and then told me it was poisonous, threw an ax at a tree I was standing in front of, missing me by inches, then mocked me for crying. He told my mom he was trying to toughen me up, and she bought it. We go back home and he only gets worse, he won't let my mom and me leave at the same time because he says he's afraid she'll leave him. He used those times to hurt me, then started molesting me. I would beg my mom not to leave me, but she had to grocery shop so we could eat. Nothing seemed amiss to her. I never told anyone what was happening because he threatened to kill my mom if I did, and I believed he would. My saving grace was when my Grandpa showed up one day because he hadn't seen or heard from us in awhile. When he meets her bf he gets the same feeling I had at first; He went and got the shotgun from his truck and told her bf that we were going home with him, and to stay away or he'd shoot him. We found out the guy was a heroine addict, and had already done the same thing to his daughter! To top it off my mom was pregnant by him with my little sister when we left. Justice was never served officially, but the guy got what he deserved, he ripped off his drug dealer and was killed for it. Kids have great gut instincts. I never dismiss my own now either. I had no control then but now I do and I would rather be considered a b*tch than trust the wrong person. I have PTSD thanks to that POS. I am a mom now, and pay close attention to how my son reacts to people. Sorry if that was TMI, but I wanted to make sure people really understand and listen to their kids, and their own, gut instincts.",

I remember sitting at a conference dinner with (largely liberal democrat) colleagues from all over the US during Edwards' first presidential run, and when I made a comment along those lines, my colleagues jumped all over me.  They informed me that I was just prejudiced against southerners (I'm from Massachusetts) and that the mannerisms that seemed a little too smooth and polished were really just the mark of a true southern gentleman.  I didn't buy it.  Eventually, of course, it came out that he was cheating on his wife (and fathering a child with his mistress) while he was campaigning and WHILE HIS WIFE WAS BATTLING TERMINAL CANCER.  He was also indicted for violating campaign finance laws, though that ended in a mistrial.  Anyway, his political career is now over and he's pretty much despised now, and none of it surprises me - I had a bad gut feeling about him from the beginning.  ",

We'll call the roommate bob and the friend from class nick.\n\nBob started to bring Nick around to parties, out to the bars with us etc. Everyone loved Nick. Social, funny, had a lot of money from his parents (he claimed it was all his) he was generous and would show up with booze, and always buy shots.\n\nSomething always rubbed me the wrong way about him. I mean outwards he was pretty cool, and everyone loved him. The way he interacted with bartenders, servers, new people we encountered- always came off as so fucking disconnected. Like they were subservient peasants, idk, to this day years later its still hard to really put it into words how those interactions i saw really creeped me the fuck out.\n\nI voiced this to one of my buddies and he said that i must have misunderstood or something along those lines. So we continued to have him around, everyone continued to love him, and i kept thinking he was really really off. He also lived nearby campus and commuted from home, but had zero friends from home- that always seemed like a red flag for a guy that was so outwardly 'cool'\n\nFast forward a year and he starts getting oddly possessive of our parties. Senior  year we lived off campus, and i heard him start telling girls (when he thought he was out of earshot), \"Yeah I own this house, but let my boys live here\"... we were renting it, and not from him.\n\nHis gf was terrified of him. Clearly miserable but wouldnt break up with him. I always suspected there was some extreme levels of crazy going on behind closed doors.\n\nHe started invited packs of strangers to our place. Our basement was huge and unfinished so it was a college kids dream, so the first few times we kind of let it slide but all the roommates were like wtf is nick doing afterwards.\n\nThings got even weirder when we finally talked him about his 'control' over our own place. He went on this long weird rant about how his dad 'owned miami' (which made no fucking sense, we were no where near florida) and that since he bought beer years ago, he was allowed to do this, he 'owned' it. But the convo was beyond weird because he wasnt screaming these, he wasnt angry, he was just ranting and explaining how all these random things built up in his mind to allow him to 'own' the house. He actually said owned at one point. (again, we were renting this place and not from him) everyone was kind of confused at his response, but he was so level headed and ridiculous that no one pushed it farther.. so we asked him not to bring as many people around but he was still welcomed to come.\n\nWe had a jersey shore theme party and thats when shit finally clicked for everyone else and he was not right. He made rounds of every single one of our gfs. He fed them the same lines i had heard him say to random girls, and even to us. It was even more wacko because he showed up with some girl, who wasnt his gf.\n\n\"You shouldnt be with bob, after all i do own these guys\"\n\n\"We should head up to so and so's room, its basically mine\" (to so and so's GF)\n\nWhen asked what he was drinking, \"Its patron on ice\" (yeah he had a cup with a shot of patron and an ice cube...)\n\nThen he left and showed back up with about 20 random people got the cops called on us...im a bit fuzzy on the progression of events the rest of the night because i was hammered and this was years ago now, but when the cops showed up he ran, got picked up down the road and like denied knowing us or something and he was with a 20 yr old.. so he put the fact that he boozed her up on us.\n\nWe never heard from him again. I felt the worst for bob, bob had graduated from a small small small hs with like a class of 20. He was so desperate for friends, that when he made friends, they were considered actual family to him. Bobs a great dude, still is, and he was crushed. Nick just straight disappeared. No one had classes with him that year, so we legit never saw him again.\n\nTLDR If you ever hear a guy tell someone he's drinking patron on ice, run away.",

I have to say it seems an odd thing to get gold for but I really appreciate it!\n\nSince I've gotten so many responses and can't respond to them all really I figured I'd update here to take care of some of the most frequently asked questions.\n\nNo, I am not currently with that boyfriend. We were, however, together for 7 years. He was very sweet and had a wonderful family but despite his being 9 years older than me I was as much his first real relationship as he was mine and I have to say 7 years is a damn good time for that kind of thing. We learned a lot from each other and being with him allowed me to come to terms with a lot of my past and actually not only like but embrace my girly side.\n\nEver since I was little I was ashamed of being a girl. I didn't really want to be a boy but I thought girls were weak because my father was a sexist prick and made me believe that. I believed this for a very long time. Sadly to this day I find it very difficult to cry but I no longer see liking pink, or sparkles, or rom coms as a bad thing. I can be silly and frivolous and girly without thinking less of myself. (isn't it interesting that the things that are considered girly are also the ones considered frivolous?)\n\nI'm so practical minded about sex that my friends have called me the young Doctor Ruth. \n\nI owe all of that to my first boyfriend. I had two boyfriends after him that were both short relationships. One cheated and the other was way too clingy and wanted me to be someone I'm not. I've honestly not been in a relationship for about seven years and I've not really wanted to be. I currently live with my brother (my only full brother, I have an older half brother and a younger half brother). This brother has basically been my best friend all of my life. He's in a relationship now and I have to say it seems exhausting. I've no reason to jump back into that until the right person comes along who's worth the effort.\n\nAs for my stepdad, yes Mom is still with him but I never see him. My brother knows everything that happened now and says if my stepfather ever steps foot on our property he will either kill him or have him arrested. My stepdad is such a chicken he won't even come within three blocks of this place.\n\nAs for my Mom, yes what she did was wrong. It was very wrong and I was very angry with her for a long time but I can't help but remember what she was like before she and Dad got divorced and he put her through hell not seeing us kids for four years, not telling her where we were and only letting us contact her when he wanted me to tell her he was going to kill himself because he wanted to make her feel like shit. My Mom worked two full time jobs with no home and sleeping in bathroom stalls to save up the money to care for us and she never stopped fighting until she got us back.\n\nI know it's not my fault or responsibility but I do feel bad knowing what she went through with him. Knowing that before they got divorced I was such a sweet and cuddly little girl. Four years later she finally got me back and I was withdrawn and afraid to be touched. She tried to talk to me about it but I couldn't tell her what happened so she stopped asking but what she didn't stop doing was loving me and letting me know that it was okay to be who I was and she'd meet me on my own terms. \n\nUnfortunately she just doesn't understand that she doesn't need a husband to survive. She's the one that always makes things work. She's the one that works hard, but she was brought up to think a man should be in charge so after her second divorce she saddled herself with another one.\n\nI have no doubt that if I'd had the courage to tell her what happened when I was twelve she would have kicked him out. He hadn't had enough time to manipulate her and make her doubt herself at that point. But asking a twelve year old who's already emotionally screwed up to open up about such a thing is just too damn hard. And honestly even at that age I kind of figured that I'd dealt with pervs before and I'd just tolerate him for mom's sake. I fought him tooth an nail whenever possible. He quickly learned not to try to sneak up close to me as I would elbow him sharply in the gut or the nuts and pretend it was a reflex.\n\nI told people on him but no one ever did anything. Not the doctor who diagnosed my ulcer, not the guidance counselor when I fought down a panic attack in study hall. (I didn't even know that was what it was at the time.) Whenever I got up the courage to tell someone nothing ever happened.\n\nThis kind of thing makes me furious and I will be damned if I ever allow such a thing to happen to any child I ever know. ",

The owner seemed nice enough, but sometimes would bring up creepy conversations regarding teenage sex lives.\n \nAnyway, the stand was in a marketplace, and I made friends with several girls that worked at other stands. Girls began to tell me stories about him regularly saying inappropriate shit to them. What stands out the most vividly in my memory , is a 14 year old girl telling me he told her how her liked the way she moved her hips when she mopped.\n\nNow that I reflect on it, its interesting that we all caught wind of his creepy remarks, yet kept working there.

He was the perfect employee, early to work, stayed late every day. He'd fix things and tinker about being all helpful when there were no customers and I was sitting around playing the expensive keyboards.\n\nI always knew he was a cunt inside. But the managers loved him for the reasons above. Had nicknames for him and shit. And then I left the job. Fast forward a few months; I go in for some guitar strings, and Jeremy's not there. Jeremy had been stealing those expensive keyboards and high end audio equipment: That's why he was staying late all the time - he was loading the gear into his mini out the back of the shop. He'd been at it for ages. He got sent to court and last I heard he was paying back incremental installments of thousands of pounds worth of stolen goods.\n\nHe got caught because he had left his eBay account logged on to the manager-who-loved-him's computer, and all the gear on there tallied, in reverse chronological order, with the stuff that had been going missing.\n\nThat was my chance for an I-Told-You-So, but Gordo looked hurt enough by it all already.",

    "body": "Holy shit, I have the story. When I was in my teens, my parents met this much younger couple who were in their early 30s, and became really good friends with them. They went to religious functions together, and this young family with their 1 young child (who we will call the smiths) were the picture of perfect Christians. I always liked the wife, but occasionally I would get a weird vibe from the husband.\n\n Fast forward a couple of years, and I decide to go to college a town away from their home, and my parents suggest that I live with them. I'm cool with that, I do a bit of cooking for them in exchange for free use of their guest bedroom. Also, right around this time I started dating my now husband. \n\nTheir house is an old fixer-upper that they liked to work on, and the windows and doors all seem to have little gaps and spaces in them.  Mrs Smith worked in the medical field, and was gone quite a bit, while Mr. Smith had a more flexible job, and was often home alone with just me, or me and his daughter. I always felt super uncomfortable with this, and he would talk and look at me in a way that just put my guard up. He would often make these possessive jokes to my boyfriend about me, which we just credited to his slight social awkwardness. \n\nI lived here for a little over 2 years, then one night his wife came home in a panic. She said he never arrived at work despite going in at 5 am. I start calling local emergency rooms, and she is driving on of his routes to work. I head to my parents house 45 minutes away to have them help with the search. My parents and I get an ominous call 2 hours later from Mrs Smith, just stating that she found him, with no other details. \n\nWe are all speculating what could have happened. Was he cheating on his wife? No, that's crazy, he is too nice of a guy. Maybe he got arrested for something really minor? \n\nTurns out he was arrested for stalking, spying on, and taking pictures of a 16 year old girl. He would watch her as she got up and dressed for school.  He did this for over 6 months before he was arrested. Once he was released on bond, he had to go to a psychologist 2 times a week, and his psychologist told him that he had to tell mrs. Smith every other instance of voyeurism.\n\nTurns out he was doing the same thing to me for the 2 years I had lived there, and may have even had a camera set up in the bathroom. He would come home, and if I was the only one home, would stand outside my bedroom window and look in the crack between my curtains for hours. \n\nHe was sentenced to 5 years probation, only had a week worth of jail time because he had 2 young children, and got off pretty scottfree. \nI ALWAYS trust my gut now.

He found a load of child porn. My dad was a computer programmer and reccomended a guy to do IT at my primary school. Few weeks in this guy calls my dad and said he'd found some stuff way over his head. Dad goes in and finds a bunch of child porn. This was back in the late 90s/early 2000s.

I mean I could just call off work if I don't have enough gas\". \n\nThat was my low point and I did quit smoking for a while. I did learn what it means to have an addiction and how it changes a person. Never in my life would I imagine that I would prioritize a drug over working, but I did. \n\nI understand that people with addictions literally cannot see clearly. That need clouds judgments and reality. I don't hold judgement on people and I know that for a person to be clean they need to be ready. \n\nI whole heartedly admit I relapsed and still smoke. I lost 2 close friends to suicide within days. I was the paramedic on scene for both. It was my crutch and I'm fighting to this day to overcome that demon. \n\nSo in short I don't think people who have never had any true addiction has a right to judge those that try, and often fail to clean themselves up. I will honestly be first in line to help them. \n\nEdit:  I also wanted to say that despite not knowing you I am proud you've managed to be sober for three years. Keep up your good work and remember if you have a slip it doesn't mean you are a failure. It's a learning a experience. You are still a success, you've beaten it this long and could do it again!\n\nAs always if you ever feel the need to talk about anything drugs, alcohol, or just feeling like you are in a bad place please do not hesitate to message me.

    "body": "My grandmother was diagnosed with lung cancer last year, and couldn't handle it mentally. After a couple of months she stopped eating and drinking, lying in bed all day. It got so bad she had to be admitted to the hospital. Afterwards she went to a nursing home to basically learn how to walk again. Walking had always been difficult for her, but after staying in bed for so long she just couldn't walk anymore. The first 2 weeks she did great, you could see her progress. Then she just... crashed. She barely ate and drank anymore, she started crawling back in bed and she would struggle breathing. The nurses told us it was all in her head, she was fine, she just had to do things. My mom tried to get them to run some tests, if only to reassure my grandmother she was fine. They refused. They sent her home. She died the next day. My mom went there to inform them of what happened, and they still refused to acknowledge that they did anything wrong. They just said \"she would have died here as well.\" That's true, but we could have said goodbye. It's been a month, and I'm still so incredibly angry. I blame them for what happened. If they had run some tests they would have known something was up. They might not have been able to do anything, but we could have said goodbye. We could have told her it was okay. We kept pushing her to get up, but she couldn't. I'll always feel guilty about that.",

The owner was a nice guy but the dude I replaced got blindsided when he was fired, like the doors were locked and they waited outside with a box of his stuff.\n\nAfter a year or so and the department I take over is doing well I get some more people working under me and my friend works in a leadership role in production. Things are generally going good at this time, I've become close friends with the receptionist (who is regularly treated like crap) and my main subordinate employee. We get this rather aggressive male heading another department and things kind of go down hill. \n\nSome allegations over sexual harassment hit the aggressive male and somehow my guy gets fired in that mess too. Then the secretary gets thrown to the curb despite being an incredibly loyal and hard working employee. I see all this happening and one day I come in and say I'm done. I'm not going to get done like those guys all were. I tell my friend that he should start looking for new work because they're going to do him dirty too.\n\nIt started with slashing his and his gf's hours. I told them again to find a new place to work. His gf got fired. Later he got fired. He's got a new job now working for a local union, but he would have been in better shape had he taken my advice and done what i told him. He ended up taking a $4 hourly pay cut when it's all said and done. Going into a job interview with a job already is better than going in unemployed. \n\nIs it worth the I told you so in the end? Absolutely not. I'm his friend, not his parent. It's not cool to step on someone's pride like that, even though I'm sure the thought crossed his mind \"I should have listened to him\" it's much better to not make that case. ",

He would talk about how I was his girlfriend and how we were going to get married but always in a 'joking' way. \n\nOnce my parents came through the drive-thru and he told them \"When me and your daughter get married she's just going to come in, grab money out of the register and say 'I'm going shopping!'\" My parents were just like uhhh wtf? I'm super short so I could bend over without bending my knees and wipe under the counter and he thought it was so 'funny' he videoed it on his phone (which was basically a video of my ass) and then showed it to me. He went to an owners convention and when he came back he told everyone about how he showed it to other people there and they all thought it was so funny. A couple of times my underwear was showing and he'd say hey pinkie if it was pink and stuff like that. \n\nIt was a bunch of high schoolers working there and we'd all talk about how creepy it was but no one ever did anything or said anything to him. One of the adult ladies took me aside and told me that if I ever wanted to bring a sexual assault case against him she would testify or whatever. It's weird how teens just brush that kind of shit off. I wish I would've filed a complaint or at least told him off for how inappropriate it was. The shitty part was that I didn't even get anything out of it like raises or longer breaks. \n\nI still live in the same town and see him at the bars and he's still as creepy as ever. Now I'm just kind of a bitch to him. ",

It was awful. I can't imagine how lonely and isolated that girl must have felt, surrounded her entire life by people that think her dad is a saint; and the courage it must have taken to finally speak up at all, let alone to a huge group of people that thought her dad could do no wrong.

I found out from the kids that he had been fired for sleeping with a girl.

My own grandma, my mom's mom and the person I cherished most, died from medical negligence. She was in and out of hospitals and nursing homes for a variety of reasons but she essentially died from bed sore getting infected because someone at a nursing home never packed her leg back up. Just left it open, a gaping hole. Untreated staph infection led to sepsis, and it was nothing short of a miracle that I was able to fly back home, alone, in the middle of the night at 34 weeks pregnant to hold her hand while we all watched her heart slow and stop. No one really got to say goodbye because she was mentally out of it by the time she was sent to the ICU. Totally, 100% preventable. Cut and dried. My grandpa lost the suit. It's been 6 years this month. \n\nI have a resentment towards nursing homes now. I can't understand how anyone could go into a job *knowing* what it will be like and still get angry with and mistreat the very people they're supposed to take care of and protect. Of course it's a difficult job. You have to wipe butts and change adult diapers, bathe people, feed them, deal with medical issues, tantrums, Alzheimer's patients running off...it can be taxing but it was emotionally rewarding, to me. The vast majority of those people would rather die than be there, especially the ones with all marbles accounted for. I always tried to be respectful and compassionate to the residents. They aren't there of their own volition. They're there because they have no one else, no one else would/could take them in. How could anyone possibly add insult to injury, or in this case vice versa? \n\nMan. Sorry, really didn't mean to rant. This is really a sore spot for me. I hate that you and your family had to go through that. No one should have to, least of all your grandma. I wish that more people cared more. ",

A fucking house several states over for her adult son from her 1st marriage who we only met once- of course Honey! And then she turned his life into a living hell- took him for all he had, left him bankrupt and told him she just pretended the whole thing though- from being spiritual to loving him. She was with another man that started buying her shit before they were even officially divorced. \n It took years for him to rebuild so much of his life and relationships with people that really mattered- I am very happy he did though- our relationship was understandably quite bumpy for several years after I turned 18 and left boarding school.\nA broken heart and man who wants to find love again after losing the love of their life can have terrible consequences unfortunately :(\nEdit: I changed a word.

Everybody knew but there was a kind of \"what can you do\" attitude, and he never went to jail or was formally accused.\n\nThen this woman heard that her sister was going to send her daughters to live with him for better education opportunities or whatever. The woman confronted her sister about it, but her sister seemed to think that it was no big deal.\n\nSo, the woman called her dad out to a hotel. She accused him of raping her and her sister and told him to stay away from her nieces. He denied the whole thing and refused to stay away from them.\n\nThe woman overpowered her father, tied him up, stuck cloth in his mouth, and castrated him. Then she called 911 to report \"a man bleeding to death\" and requested an ambulance. When they got there he was dead, not from bleeding out, but from suffocation. \n\nShe didn't mean to kill her father, but I don't think she was too broken up about it.\n\nETA: more info on her\nhttp://murderpedia.org/female.H/h/harris-brigitte.htm",

He actually did have very bad anxiety, which he partly dealt with by lying about anything and everything that would have made him uncomfortable to talk about, including his unfaithfulness to his girlfriends. \n\nHis strategy was that he simply NEVER EVER *EVER* admitted to a lie, no matter how much he was caught or even how insignificant the lie was. First he would repeat \"This is a misunderstanding. It's just a misunderstanding.\" Then he would get emotional and act like you were attacking him. One time I simply would not let something go so first he randomly asked if I would care if he killed himself, then he started screaming that I was crazy and had made this up. He sounded so convinced that I was completely making something up (begging me to tell him why I would lie about him like this, and what he'd done to make me hate him and want to hurt him like this) that he started to make me question my own memory. He was so invested. But usually the first few steps worked. Unless you already knew the kinds of things he'd lie about and how fervently he seemed to believe his own lies, it was really easy to just take him at his word.\n\nSo anyway, that's one strategy for dealing with remembering a bunch of lies. If you're really convincing when you're caught in saying \"Oh no no, this is just a misunderstanding. Don't worry, I'd never do that, I'm sure we can clear this up. You trust me, right?\" it works for a good while, at least.\n\nI remember when I first caught him in a huge lie. He was sticking to his guns but I knew 100% that what he was saying couldn't be true and that it couldn't be a mistake. As soon as I realized what a devoted liar he was, it suddenly hit me like a ton of bricks that I'd heard that speech before. Every time he didn't have his rent cheque, for instance. It was a bizarre feeling to have the last year of your life suddenly dramatically change in context.",

Flatmate sends a cartoon/picture of a woman being roasted like a Thanksgiving turkey to the guy, with the caption : *This is what happens to the bitch that you talk to...*\n\nI freaked out when she showed that to me and her explanation was, she is entitled to go out, date and fuck other men, where the boyfriend can't even look at his own female colleagues. Downright crazy. \nShe fucked another guy, because the boyfriend chose to watch The Force Awakens with his cop buddies, over an evening with her. No remorse, instead she kept mocking the other guy's girlfriend. ",

When I was 4 and my sister was 7, my family didn't know that my grandfather on my father's side had been raping my cousins and aunts, with my grandmother's help. It had been happening for years apparently and no one in the family was brave enough to go to the court. It was disgusting, how they all normalized being raped and allowing their daughters and cousins to be raped.\n\nWell when me and my sister were born lo and behold he suddenly became very interested in spending time with our family (we lived an hour away, and that side of the family notoriously hated my mother so my parents never got visits from them ) When he would come around he would try to \"play with us\" by assaulting us and trying to get us undressed. \n\nBut my mother knew what pedophilia looked like. She had been raped as a child by her uncle (he was mentally disabled and targeted her for his sexual desires. He is in jail now) and knew what that look in my grandfather's eyes when he looked at me and my sister. As soon as my sister told my mom that he has tried to touch her \"private place\" my mom immediately took him to court.\n\nLong story short, my dad's side of the family, including my grandfather, were taken to court. Only my sister testified against him (I guess I was too young to testify) My grandmother and all of the aunts and cousins and nieces all tried to plea he had never raped them, they were just a \"close family\". He only got jail time  for 5 years and was let our on good behavior.  My mom and dad now never force me and my sister to interact with that side of the family if we don't want to. Which we dont.\n\nAnd my mom is a hero for believing me and my sister and stopping the generational abuse. I can't thank her enough for standing up for us. Whenever we talk about it, my mom says it was the only good thing that came out of being raped by her uncle, was that she could recognize that behavior and save her children from it when her parents saw it didn't save her.",

Someone did report it, it went to trial and he got off because of his standing in the community and no one wanting to believe someone they knew so well could do this. This all came out because he continued the behavior and when he started in on it again with his young granddaughter, his DIL flipped and is trying really hard to get charges pressed and get him locked up. However, despite multiple other people coming forward that he did this to them, he still hasn't been arrested and people are still taking his side. This has been going on for almost 2 years. Sometimes reporting it isn't enough. It may stop the abuse for 1 child, but we as a society have to be able to put our personal feelings aside for people like this (who we thought we knew!) and hold them accountable. ",

Every year, the kids would always say, \"I hope I get Mr. ___ this year!\"  I went to a Christian school and he led some very good, thought-provoking chapels. You could tell he was super intelligent and quick-witted. \n\nSome of the girls in his class said that he was a bit too touchy-feely at times but everyone just shrugged it off. Then it came out that some of  the foreign-exchange students he hosted at his home were filing charges for rape against him. It was an enormous scandal as you can imagine but nobody wanted to believe it. His students and the majority of the student body protested against the trial. They insisted that the poor kids, who hardly spoke English and heavily marginalised because of it, were making the whole thing up. \n\nIt was really awful. Because the teacher was such a pillar of society and a huge part of our school and church, he pretty much just got a slap on the wrist. He was put on probation for two years and had to pay a fine. The girls he allegedly raped had to continue living with him until the end of the school year which was another six months. I cannot imagine the nightmare that situation must've been for those girls. \n\nHe continued working as a teacher and still hosted exchange students but he ended up being accused again of rape about five years later. This time from a family friend's 7 year old little girl. He lost his job but again people didn't want to believe it and even though he got a stiffer punishment this time, he was only locked up for a few months. \n\nIt was really astonishing how many people stood by him and accused the victims of lying. Now that I'm a parent, this stuff really frightens me. ",
