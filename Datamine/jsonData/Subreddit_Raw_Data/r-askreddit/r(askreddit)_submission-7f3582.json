Ask for a tutor and actually try in math because when I was in high school I hated math because I wasn't naturally good at it like I was with history and English so I thought I wanted to get into those fields, but having grown up I realized I want to do something like my dad and be an engineer. \n\nc. Actually try in high school (ie take as many AP classes as possible). I graduated with a 2.9 from one of the best schools in my hometown, and we had a lot of kids go to Harvard, Stanford, Berkeley, etc. If I had gotten good grades I would have been able to go to one of those schools instead of Humboldt State my first year.\n\nd. Ask to go back to the therapist I had when I was 10 because I dealt with a lot of mental issues in high school and contemplated suicide multiple times and going back to her was one of the best decisions I ever made. \n\ne. Not be such a goodie two shoes all the time. I missed out on a lot of cool stuff because I didn't want to get in trouble or make my parents angry and I regret that. Also, go to my dances regardless of what people thought of me. \n\nf. Take the computer science course. I learned recently that I not only love it, but I'm good at it. \n\ng. Know that I'm not a failure or not cut out for anything. If you want something you'll make it happen, because you aren't made for anything except to be you, everything else is up to you.

He died when I was 16 and I feel like I knew him better long after he was gone.\n* Hang out with my father's mother and practice her meatball recipe with her. I can make her red sauce, I love making pasta in sardine sauce, and I make a decent lasagna. However I never got that chance with the bugnarole and I miss those meatballs every day.\n* Hang out with my uncle Paul. I miss him so much.

    "body": "Take your time reading this, it's much information at once. But I think, all of it is important.\n\nThe first thing, is to learn that the world is a good place in most ways. This video, influenced me more than most people: https://www.ted.com/talks/hans_rosling_shows_the_best_stats_you_ve_ever_seen - Watch it, a hundred times.\n\nI think the most important thing at your age is having good friends. At your age, the people you will most learn from is your peer group. I mean people who are willing to put in work for the things they want to succeed in. Who enjoy their life and the people around them. They will lift you up and you will lift them up. If you fall in love with one of them, go for it. But make sure they are descent, before hand. Use condoms. Don't hesitate to break up, if you feel like they are not treading you right. Don't marry early.\n\nGet to know yourself and stay in line with your principles. Don't base them on religion, or other holistic worldviews. Try to make a rational, logical argument for the things you believe in - If you can't, it's usually not a thing you should stick with.\n\nIf you have a good family, spend as much time with them as you can. People die. If you feel like there are relatives around you that are giving you a hard time - Distance yourself, when you can. Don't pressure yourself to meet their expectations. Pressure will lead to frustration and stress and that's not a thing you need. At all. They are the leading causes for depression.\n\nThen, don't get too worked up, if you have done something \"wrong\". It's ok, you are young by any means. Try to understand what you did, especially emotionally, and then either try to fix it or apologize. If that doesn't help, that's ok. Learn to be a responsible person and don't panic. Learning that you can deal with your own problems, is very important. If you feel like you need help, never hesitate to ask for it. Multiple times, if you need to. Hold the same standard to other people - If they try to do better, don't hold a grudge. If they don't, it's a bad sign. Don't be afraid of conflict, they are mandatory to find mutual solutions.\n\nAnother important thing to understand is that having fun is at core of learning, especially when it comes to school. It's proven that fun is mandatory for actually taking in information on a deep level. So have a good time, as much as you can. If you enjoy a subject, milk it. Be proud of it. If people think you are a apple polisher or geek - Let them think what they want. If there are things, that you do not enjoy, try to be average. You don't need to be good at everything but you'll soon realize that once you get better at things, the easier they get because they become fun. \n\nThen I do agree with everyone who says you should form good habits. Read as much as you can. Having the ability to absorb and understand information is one of the most important skills to have and nurturing that is key. When you wake up, just get out of bed. Then make your own bed, it will give you a reason to stand up. And brush your teeth. Run once or twice a week - Or do any other sport you might enjoy. Don't go to bed too late and don't use screens 1 hour before bedtime - Which includes your phone (I wish I had learned that , when I was younger.) Sleep is very important for the development of your brain.\n\nTry to get a part-time job, for the money and experience. If you can, do something you enjoy. When you saved up some money, travel. Especially when your family can support you. Often, experiences are more worth than saving every last penny. That said, you should save a share of it. Not just for the validation, but so you can learn to handle money. One major advice adding to this, if you can try to learn a second language - This is extremely valuable on the job-market. The easiest way to do so, is by travelling. Alone. \n\nAlso, don't spend money on status items. You don't need designer clothes or the new iPhone. If people offer such presents to you, ask them to get a present you actually need, or a similar present that costs less and some cash on the side.\n\nNEVER get a credit card. In general, stay away from debt. EDIT: The other way around, at some point credit cards are fine as people added.\n\nDon't smoke cigarettes, they are insanely addictive. If you are interested in drugs, don't do them before 18, when your brain is mostly developed. Otherwise they might fuck with your personality, especially when depression and similar conditions are common in your family. Also, I always preferred them in non-party setting.\n\nAnd don't take advice from strangers. They don't know you ;) Also, most opinions are far less important then you might think.\n\nHave a good life! Greetings from Germany,\n\nfogg\n\nEDIT: A man, I like to listen and look up to is Warren Buffett. He might seems a bit boring, but he has more wisdom in his old brain then most of us will ever gather in their lifetime. ",

It's much better to look dumb now than look dumb as a mostly functional adult when people expect you to know better.\n\n- Learn to accept when you're wrong, and have the strength to swallow your pride and apologize when you are. Doesn't have to be a big deal all the time. Just a \"my bad, I thought x and y\" can  work for the small stuff.\n\n- Don't be afraid to try new things, but do have the willpower to say \"no\" to stuff you aren't comfortable with. It can sometimes be confusing discerning the two, but I found the stuff I was hesitant about usually had \"I could get in trouble\" consequences attached.\n\n- Value yourself and prioritize. Your body and your mind are your own. Care for them the best you can. Staying up all night and being a zombie at school or having a sweet tooth is cool here or there, but try not to make that kind of stuff a habit lol. If it's bs, it can wait.\n\n- Safe sex is the best sex. That pullout stuff is for dummies. Becoming a young parent or catching an std is not something you want to roll the dice on.\n\n- Don't brush off school. I'm not saying to go hyper study, but as a recent college grad, I can confidently say discipline pays off.\n\n- At the same time, college isn't the end all for everyone. There are many ways to make a living out here. Some of them make more than others yeah, but it's important that you find something you enjoy doing above all else. College is just the one most people suggest.\n\n- Make some memories. Find fun stuff to do and meet new people. You only get one shot in life, and you don't want to waste it being unhappy or alone.\n\n- I'm totally not an expert. Just an internet stranger telling you what I learned so far :)",

I don\u2019t mean like \u201cgosh she\u2019s pretty\u201d, I mean it looks like she was a busty Playboy model built exclusively for sex. She was always blonde with a pretty face and was a comfortable weight, but one day she seemed to just spontaneously become a wasp-waisted pornstar with D cups, birthing hips, and fuck-me lips. \n\nI say she was \u201cuncomfortably\u201d attractive because it honestly seemed to be too much and made things uneasy in school. Male teachers were *terrified* of being seen alone with her, and they would stare at the ground whenever she walked near them (It didn\u2019t help that she walked around with the mannerisms of a hooker in heat). It was even a little awkward for the male students. Any guy talking to her about schoolwork was glared at with angry envy by every other guy, and every girl fumed with jealously and later took it out on the poor guy that had just been asking the fuck-princess for a spare piece of paper.\n\nShe never graduated because the exact *day* she turned 18, she dropped out of class, left her home, and became a high class escort in Vegas. We know this because several guys in our class actually took a road trip to Vegas later that year (an 18 hour drive) solely to hit her up and, uh, support her new profession. We later learned that she had been cut from the same cloth as her mom, who had been one of the most exclusive prostitutes in Vegas in the 1980s, which makes sense and explains the daughter\u2019s over-the-top pornstar genes.\n\nBut damn, she was really something back when she was an \u201cinnocent\u201d teenager. To this day I\u2019ve never seen a girl with a more extreme cup-size to waist ratio, or a girl that, for better or worse, seemed to instantly make any guy think of sex. I\u2019d honestly feel bad for her, but from all accounts she was thrilled with her body and her new job. If only I had known back before she hit puberty, and got close to her before it all began...",

    "body": "Someone here on Reddit shared a story of how he got into a car collision and he knocked out for about like a couple minutes or less but within that time frame he was \u201cunconscious\u201d and says that he lived a long, vivid, and detailed life; from getting the job he wanted to meeting his wife and having kids. Then one day, he\u2019s just sitting in his living room and the lamp just looks odd. He was fixated on the lamp for days and his family was worried but he could not let it go. His wife and kids eventually left the house scared of his behavior and one day the lamp started to contort even more until it sucked him in and he wakes up at the scene of the car collision distraught and disoriented wondering where his family was and everything else that he lived through for what seemed to be like 22 years if I remember correctly. Salvia seems to do the same thing from what I\u2019m reading here. Wish I could find that story again.",

There's an anesthetizing aspect to it that's undeniable. And hard to describe, starting with tiny, prickly feelings on the skin, followed by a strange feeling of being rolled into your side, even if you're laying flat on your back with your arms and legs splayed, that comes in waves with no beginning or end, like shepard tones, but with touch, not sound.\n\n  Then, you probably won't remember much that's easily describable. The 2 dimensional flattening of the world that sometimes accompanies it is almost impossible to put into words. The feeling of pushing open a set of doors made of treacle in front of you, like the motion you'd imagine yourself making if you were trying to open a giant Venus fly traps mouth from the inside, even though to the outside observer your arms are extended out sideways like you're making snow angels. It's such a disconnect. Maybe you'll \"see\" geometric shapes or millions of tiny spheres moving along a track  or something similar. I use quotation marks around the word \"see\" because at that point the very idea of your senses don't really mean much.  Then you return to your senses, you get this feeling that someone just played a trick on you, even if you're the only person around. ",

Not only that, but Joe fancied himself some type of botanist/amateur chemist, and he had somehow extracted the active ingredients from the salvia (some type of sieve and alcohol) and of course gave some to me. \n\nI literally had no clue what salvia was but proceeded to smoke this concentrated salvia powder out of a water bong. A whole big bowl. Huh.. I don't feel anything.. maybe I should smoke another entire bowl. Seems logical. \n\nSometime immediately after I finished the second bowl I awoke kneeling in the corner of my room sweating profusely. I was in a new world. As I walked by my tv that was on I remember seeing a Chevy \"like a rock\" commercial where at the end a ton of bricks come falling down on the Chevy logo.. when those bricks hit the logo.. it was if it had hit me. I fell flat to the floor. Or I should say through the floor. \n\nWake up again... look at the tv.. Frasier is on. I cannot overemphasize how real it was when Frasier himself turned and started talking directly to me. He didn't want just casual conversation either.. he had a message to deliver to me.. the world was ending. I couldn't believe it, but he convinced me. So much so, that I ran out into the dining room area outside of me sleeping mother's room, screaming at the top of my lungs in just my underwear, still sweating profusely: \"mom, wake up.. the world is ending, the world is ending!\" Haha. Holy fuck.. she comes running out.. \"boy, wtf are you on?\" My bro was pretty wild, this wasn't her first rodeo!\n\nTakes me to bed, gets me a cold rag on my head, and calls my gf  at the time.. finally got to Joe and his parents, all at 3 in the  morning.  All in all, she wasn't even mad, just worried and freaked the fuck out. Lol. I can only imagine waking up to that. \n\nShe was a good mom. I miss her. Happy Thanksgiving to all.. appreciate time with your loved ones.\n\n",

I was quite literally in another, completely alien world yet at the same time was in my past as a non living object. For about 20 minutes after my trip ended I was positive I came back into the wrong dimension/reality, it was horrifying. I still try to wrap my head around it all and am completely fascinated by the experience. I haven't found the courage to do it again and I love bending time and space with substances.",

It was pretty amazing. I felt like I landed in my body after that trip.\n\nA much lighter trip was pretty fun too. I decided to see what would happen if I sat infront of a flatscreen TV playing a cheesy zombie comedy movie. My friends watched to keep me from running into the TV or jumping out the window lol. What happened was amazing. A zombie hand must have been coming into frame from the left side of the TV screen. In my \"vision\" I saw a line of these hands growing out of my wall. I was laughing and trying to high-five them in my mind. My friends tell me I was just sitting there going \"Huh huh huh\" in a really deep voice.\n\nAnother experiment I did ended up being my new salvia routine. - total darkness. At night before bed, I would take a massive bong rip and while holding it in I would run across my room and kill the light switch, then dive back into my bed. I had this really thick comforter that was amazing feeling, even when sober. Once my trip kicked in, I was basically swimming in a sea of comforter, flopping around in my bed on what felt like massive waves of pleasure/softness.",

I was trying to get 25x, but all they had was 60, so the first time I hit it was out of a bubbler in the forest and it was really amazing and peaceful. Was sitting on a bench and got the flattened feeling along with some really subtle translucent visuals. Second time I hit it from a bong in my friends driveway. He went first and by the time I was inhaling, I looked up and noticed him crying and was like wtf?! It was too late though and I got those uncontrollable giggles and disappeared into my head. I completely lost my vision for idk how long, but got hit really hard with the 2d feeling and I felt like I was viewing myself outside of my body, but in this weird black void. I seriously felt like I was there for years and it was terrifying. I was just sort of trapped, floating/rotating tied to this weird paper doll chain. I couldn't move away from it no matter what I tried. My vision finally started coming back and my girlfriend and her friend we're trying to get me to sit down. Apparently I had gotten up and was just spinning in circles. When I looked at them I was seeing 3 horizontal layers of my gf and her friend. I thought they were different layers of reality or something and I needed to get centered on the one in the middle but I kept drifting up and down. They looked terrifying and evil in the bottom layer, but eventually I got on the right one and came down pretty quick. It fucked with my head for about a week though. I will never do it again.

And someone \u201cgod\u201d was turning the pages. He got to see his life play out, but realized that if the person kept flipping the pages he would get to the end of the book (his life) he started freaking out and asking the person to slow down, he wanted to enjoy life. But the person started flipping faster and faster. he started begging the person to let him live just a little bit longer, and then he came back to reality.\n\nIn the real world, he had been sitting down in the grass, got and started running for 30 feet. He looked scared to death and even though we were talking to him trying to \u201ccalm him down\u201d he was visibly scared/afraid. He Dropped to his knees and looked hopeless, and when he came to, he had no idea how he got to the place he was. \n\nI honestly feel like the trip changed him, before we all tried it together he was very impulsive and crazy, often going street racing and being a playboy. He ended up selling all his street racing cars, married his wife and had a baby. All within 2 years. He completely changed and i still credit salvia for teaching him the value of life he wouldn\u2019t have learned any other way.\n\nEdit: what fascinated me about salvia was that when I would smoke it, often it would hit mid inhale so I would literally not remember completing the whole inhale/exhale of actually smoking it. It\u2019s like taking a deep breath and then BAM you\u2019re somewhere else. ",

But I was terrified, and thought \"I'm not ready for this\", and then felt acknowledgement and got sent back into the room. \n\nTripped out hard for 20 more mins, became my friends arm, felt the stomach feeling as he lifted it up and down because I was it, I felt the motion of being his arm. Chair was talking to me. Ran up my friends shirt, because he became a giant and his shirt was green, so it was a big field of grass somehow. \n\nAnd then as I was coming to, shit I was looking at would randomly swirl, like a glitch. Like a little vortex/swirl distortion effect you can do in photoshop. And it was like I forgot what everything was. EVERYTHING. And my brain rapidly made sense of everyday objects one by one in the room. \"Ok, that orange squiggly thing is an extension cord. That's a desk.\", it was like a brain reset. Never again, my god. \n\nI've often wondered if I'm still on it, I read stories about people experiencing very long periods of time on it.
