Your \"win\" is just a tactic to get you into the dealership.\n\nA fun thing to do is waste the manager's time.\n\nGo to the dealership, \"prize\" flyer in hand. Find an nice car. One with all of the options. Ask for every dealer add on they offer and tell them you don't want to waste time negotiating, you have cash. Talk to the manager, and keep going back to him/her. Insist on a test drive with the manager. Convince them you want to buy the car, and get to the paperwork phase. \n\nThen, just before you sign, inform them that they haven't sold you a car. They've sold you on the idea of buying a car. Get the manager's card and tell them you'll be dropping their card in a hat with other dealership manager's cards. A card will be selected at random and that dealership manager will be notified by mail in 4 to 6 weeks. Let them know that the actual car you buy may not be the one used in your \"promotion.\"\n\nUpdate: thank you kind stranger!",

    "body": "Oh shit I hope I'm not too late to get this out there.\n\nWhen I was working in sales this is what they taught me to psychologically trick people into buying whatever shit we were selling. Strap in, this could be long.\n\nFirst up, everything I learnt in sales worked through what they called 'impulse' selling, which means playing on people's tendencies to make a decision based on their current state of emotion. Salesmen will build your level of 'impulse', and then 'close' you. The 'close' is the point at which they seal the deal, and you give them your money in exchange for whatever they have convinced you that you need.\n\nThere are five basic ways that salesmen will 'impulse' you. The acronym they taught us was G.I.F.T.S.\n\nThe first was 'Greed'. People are naturally greedy. By which I mean they want more for their money. They want a good deal. If people think they can make or save money, they are more inclined to buy. An example of this is basic 'half price' or 'buy X, get Y free' sales.\n\nI stands for 'Indifference'. People can smell desperation. If they sense that you have a motive for wanting them to do something (like buy) they will be more wary, and want to know your reasons. Therefore, a salesman will try to make it seem as though they do not care whether or not you buy (even if they are on commission). After all, they are only offering you this amazing deal for your own benefit.. They have nothing to gain..\n\nThird was 'Fear of Loss'. Causing people to worry that they will miss out if they don't buy. This can be exploited by making people think that this is their one and only opportunity to purchase at a 'reduced rate', or used in conjunction with 'Greed', for example 'buy in the next 60 minutes and get X free!'.\n\nT, 'The Jones' Theory'. If your community is getting on-board with an idea, there is no reason that you shouldn't too. It's safe. 'It's all the rage'. 'Everybody's doing it'. 'Don't miss out'. This also ties in with 'Fear of Loss'.\n\nThe last one is 'Sense of Urgency'. Can be used in similar ways as 'Fear of Loss', i.e. 'buy in the next 60 minutes or else X', or as subtly as a salesman saying that they have other appointments and won't be able to come back and offer you this deal for a too-long period of time. A sense of urgency causes people to buy more impulsively, especially when coupled with a fear of loss.\n\nOnce salesmen have 'impulsed' you enough, they will try to 'close' you. I was also taught a number techniques to 'close'.\n\nThe first was the 'assumptive close'. This is basically assuming that the person will buy and filling out the paperwork. A common example of this is a salesman simply asking for your your name, and the proceeding with the sale. They will fill out an entire form and then just ask you to sign at the end.\n\nThis is often assisted by the 'trial close', where a salesman will slowly push you over the line, while at the same time testing you to see if you are 'impulsed' enough to buy. They will do this by asking you closed questions, aimed at steering you down a conversational track which leads to a sale. Charity workers do this a lot when they ask 'Do you like dolphins?' (yes), 'Do you think dolphin's habitats should be protected?' (yes), 'How much do you spend on beer / tea / coffee a week?' ($5-$50), 'Do think you could put $X towards saving the dolphins?' (umm, well, I guess you got me there..)\n\nAnother powerful close is the 'alternative close', where salesmen will offer you one of two choices, both of which result in a sale. 'So would you like the regular option or the slique-deluxe?'. Often presented assumptively (see 'assumptive close').\n\nThe last was the 'silent close'. Harder to use, but effective with indecisive buyers or people that pull back when pressured. Basically presenting the overwhelming positives with the easily countered negatives, and then shifting control of the conversation to the buyer, and forcing them to say 'yes' or 'no'. Obviously, the salesman has presented the information in such a way that you would be stupid to say 'no'. After building tension and excitement for the product, they let you come to the decision themselves.\n\nAlmost every person who sells goods or services has been taught something along these lines, and the most successful salesmen have this information at the forefront of their minds when they are selling to you. Never forget it. These people just want your money, they honestly do not generally care what you get out of it.\n\nEdit - Some spelling + TYFTGKS. Also, if anyone ever wants to give me gold, please donate it to a dolphin sanctuary or something instead. Thanks!",

    "body": "Maybe not dirty, but incompetent contractors will often way underbid jobs. So if you request a bunch of quotes, and all the bids are relatively close except for one that's way lower, there's roughly a 100% chance that guy will screw it up and you'll have a nightmare on your hands. Sometimes you get what you pay for.\n\nAlso, FWTW, if a bid is high, it probably means they don't want the job.\n\nEdit: For everyone asking why you would bid high rather than just reject the job, it's considered unprofessional to just not bid a job. It's leaves a sour taste in customers' mouths when you just outright don't even give them a price. Reasons you don't want the job could include.\n\n1. You're out of manpower and can't staff it.\n2. There's something about the job that makes you not want to deal with it. For example, fixing an air conditioning that wasn't installed right means you could be looking at a job that is actually going to take months, still not be right after you're done, and the customer could blame you, not the original contractor. No thanks.\n3. Customer is an asshole or difficult in some way. He might have non-asshole friends, however, you don't want him badmouthing to. So the goal is don't piss him off, but also try not to work for him either.\n\nEdit 2: Should have put this in the original comment. Sometimes they will outright steal from you or half do a job, take the money and run. They count on you being either too poor or too passive to take them to court.",

I've literally seen a $5k order get dropped to $750.\n\nThey then send your order off either to their CPC (Central Production Center), OR they literally call another local company and they do it.

    "body": "Former commission sales guy here. The body language tactics & psychology behind the salesmanship is hugely underappreciated.\n\nMost people know the simple tricks. *eg: Handshakes/appropriate physical touch, and calling you by name multiple times in the sale makes you all warm and fuzzy towards the sales guy.* But the rabbit hole goes *way* deeper than that, and most sales people don't even get this far (at least not on purpose), but the best ones will. I actually stopped using some of these when I sold because I didn't feel moral with how astoundingly effective some of them were.\n\n**Mirroring:**\n\nGradually making hand gestures, copying speech patterns (eg: swear if they swear, use expressions they use, etc) and standing similarly to the customer. The PUA community latched onto this one too, so more people know about it, but it's simple and effective.\n\n**Using gestures to inject thoughts/feelings:**\n\nThis one's subtle, and an extension of mirroring. They'll create a \"good space\", and a \"negative space\" with hand motions (as a simple example). They'll then associate things they want you to buy with the good space, and associate the bad space with things they don't want to deal with. So as an example:\n\n\\*Gestures left hand\\* \"Ah, your Check Engine light lit up on the way here?! Ugh! I remember being stranded on the highway, it was awful.\"\n\n\\*Gestures right hand\\* \"On the upside, my father picked me up, and we had a *great* talk the whole way home! Turned out the fix was really simple too!\"\n\n\\*Gestures left hand\\* \"Now, I know your car is dead in the water...\"\n\n\\*Puts right hand on the car he wants you to buy and runs his hand along the hood in the same motion as the gesture\\*: \"But the good news is this beauty is right up your alley!\"\n\nIt's best demonstrated in person/visually, but hopefully this gives a reasonable idea. It's obviously not as fast as the example above, but done in slow sequences throughout the whole sale, slowly, in baby steps, until you can literally start moving your \"good\" hand, and they immediately start nodding. I actually stopped using this one because I found it too manipulative.\n\n**Big ol' goofy smile, no questions asked:**\n\nWe feel guilty when we say no to a very friendly person. A good sales person won't ask you \"How are you?\", or \"Can I help you with something?\". They'll just say \"HI!\" and smile until you get uncomfortable. If you respond with \"Just looking\" or something similar, they'll stick around, because they didn't ask you in the first place. They'll just play it off as a big friendly joke. \"Oh, that's cool! I love this one, it's so sleek. <Begin sales pitch>\"\n\n#**Over. The. Top. Language THAT WORKS AMAZINGLY:**\n\nSetting politics aside, ever notice Trump's expressions? Everything is fantastic, amazing, and the best thing to happen to America since sliced bread. It sounds super corny, but that's because we're watching it from home, not mid-sale.\n\nFace to face, I have no doubt this works for Trump. Lauding a customer's decision (the one you want them to make) with exaggeration pairs really well with the \"Big ol' goofy smile\" technique. The product they want is fantastic, their decision is fantastic, and so is this unnecessary purchase I want you to buy. They're all FANTASTIC.\n\nIf you've ever read cold copy on infomercials and \"free\" online webinars, etc, they're filled with ALL CAPS and flowery BUY NOW language. They usually have extra punctuation, similar to Trump's statements (eg: \"One. Hundred. Percent.\")\n\nIMO, this one's best for one-time sales, not for repeat business, so we see it less these days. Most companies realize customer retention is much more profitable than acquiring new ones, but this sales technique is still alive in many, many industries.\n\n**The price match policy is a *closing technique*, not customer service:**\n\nEver notice when you go in with a prepared price match, a lot of stores will fight it tooth and nail? That's because it's not for you. It's for the on-the-fence customers who aren't sure about buying. Have no illusions: *The price match policy is almost always the same as their return policy*.\n\nWhen you're on the fence, the sales person will reassure you that the price won't get any better by pointing to the policy. All they're really saying is \"Well, you can always get a refund later.\" They know the refund is *way* more work for you than it is them, and statistically, once you're home, you're unlikely to keep looking around. Who keeps TV shopping a week after they bought a TV?\n\n**Good sales people are *very* tightly scripted, and A/B test their pitches & counters to objections:**\n\nMost people *kind of* know this, because we've all dealt with bad coldcallers clumsily working through a sales script. But good sales is scientific as hell, and this is still true of in-person sales. You are the umpteenth iteration of a sales script they've recited over and over, and swapped out specific sentences (or even singular words) until they've found what works.\n\nThe skilled ones will keep track of objections made by past customers, and keep trying different counters until they find one that works for them most of the time. Most of the sale is spent pre-addressing common objections before you can ask, and they filter you into a logical conclusion where you have no objections left, before you've even made them. They'll make it sound like the answer to the objection was your idea too (See: Big goofy smile, no questions, above).\n\n**My personal favourite: Most customers think marketing & sales techniques work, but not on them**\n\nI see it on reddit every day. I love how confident people are with this, because it's so demonstratively false. I wish I knew the psychological term for it, because it's one of my favourite cognitive dissonance examples in real life.\n\nYou are not immune. I promise. If you think critically, you *will* find examples of advertising and sales working on you. I promise.\n\n* The body wash, shampoo, and deodorant I use are all due to brand recognition (ie: marketing) in my teens, when I moved out of the parents' house and had to start buying this stuff for myself for the first time.\n* If you've ever gotten something at the impulse section at stores, that's another one.\n* If you've ever \"found out\" about a sale on something from an employee, flyer, or just by browsing, and picked it up.\n\n(Almost) *no one* goes into a store to ask for an extended warranty, a technician to do it all for them, or for 6 accessories for their $400 laptop or their used car.\n\n**tl dr;** Read the bolded titles.",

Find yourself a family owned pharmacy if you a) don't want to go through your insurance b) don't have insurance or c) you'd like to support the working class and not walmart or CVS. People would call us and ask for a cash price for their medication. We would be hundreds of dollars cheaper than walmart on almost every prescription. I remember quoting someone a 90 day medication at $20 and they said walmart was going to charge $250. The reason I said the things about not going through insurance is because insurance companies tell the pharmacy how much to charge you and tell the pharmacy how much the medications cost. Shit, add insurance companies to this list. Family owned pharmacies are losing so much money because of the way insurance companies work.\n\nEdit: I can't spell\n\nEdit 2: wow this blew up while I was at work! Okay so by reading the comments it sounds like what I said is true at most places but that doesn't mean there aren't pharmacies that are more expensive. It depends on where you live I guess! \n\nAlso, Thanks for the gold!!!\n\nEdit 3: lots of people are asking how to find a family owned pharmacy in their town. Honestly, I am not too sure. I stumbled upon this one and applied for a job because my mom had a patient talk about it. Was dumb luck. Maybe check a phone book or Google?",

What you need to understand is that every employee at enterprise is in sales, but they don't make commission. Everyone there has sales targets to hit in order to simply keep their jobs, and the company turns a blind eye to the practice of rap-slapping.  Essentially, you tell the customer the total of their rental, including taxes and surcharges, is X when it is really Y, and you include the coverage on their bill without them knowing or consenting.  Some people will argue, and the employee will say they can \"work in a discount\" and will take the coverage away (insider tip, any enterprise employee can discount up to $100 without manager approval).\n\nThis sounds bad already, but it gets worse: the management, as well as other sales reps, train you on WHO to \"rap slap\": the elderly, people with a language barrier, people who've never rented before.\n\nTL;DR: Enterprise Rent-a-Car employees hide unwanted insurance coverage on rentals in the tax, and typically pray on the elderly/people who don't speak English",

So for instance if you're wanting to buy a Prius, take the car in question to a Toyota dealer.  Call the service dept and make the appointment, they will know what you're talking about. If the seller refuses, walk away.  Even if they agree, the dealer may find significant problems. It's an insurance that costs you about $200 but can save you thousands. \n\nIf you have a moment, read my personal story below.\n\nI live in Chicago and have a long commute to the suburbs, so wanted to buy a used Prius.  I found a good price (15K) on Craigslist for a 2yr old Prius. Seller gave me the VIN for Carfax, which checked out clean.  I asked if I could test drive it and take it to a nearby Toyota dealer, which he happily agreed.  After sitting in the waiting room for over an hour, the mechanic comes in and says \"Sir, are you really thinking about buying this car?\".  He then gives me a laundry list of significant problems including two frame-bending accidents, and extensive electrical issues.  He explained that people will buy totalled cars, then do repairs themselves or have friends do repairs so that Carfax is not allerted.  I think they call these 'rebuilt' titles.  When I brought it back to the seller, he did not deny it, he just laughed and said someone else will buy it, and he's probably right.  Dickhead cost me $200 but the inspection saved me $15000  I still see the seller's ads all the time on CL, he always has multiple cars for sale.  Some he outright labels \"rebuilt title\"  others, he doesn't.  So I imagine they are all rebuilds.\n\nCarfax is not enough.  Get the inspection.\n\n\nTLDR: don't trust Carfax, bring a used car to a dealer for pre-purchase inspection.",

    "body": "Economist here. Working for a university in Denmark, currently researching business/consumer markets (b2c).\n\nDuring the 80's a trend went viral with large stores. As many knows we live in a completely competitive market when it comes to shopping. You probably have 100+ places to shop groceries in any larger town. \n\nHowever a few shops dominate the market. In Denmark we have a few dominating the whole 'everyday shopping' market (General store). These are places like Fakta, Bilka, F\u00f8tex, Netto, Rema, Aldi and so on. Since they have a large economic capital, they have some large benefits of scale. **Since they buy in bulks they get everything cheaper than stores that don't buy in bulks, this drives down the competitive price and forces smaller businesses out of business.**\n\n**However! When you drive down prices you often drive down profits.**\n\nSo what they did was genius. They first forced many smaller companies out of business, by having low, competitive prices. Then they made a sort of oligopol. They made an internal deal where they kept prices high through **time limited discount offers**. \n\nWhat this did was, **stores would never have discounts on the same products.** The discounts on products would be time limited, so only for a week or so. **This signaled that the company didn't want a price war. Which drives down profits.** Because the logic goes 'If I have a product on sale now, I will sell more, but then you will have a sale next week on the same product and you will sell more'. The total net gain would still be more than if they both competed. \n\nSo what this basically came down to was Pepsi and coke. Soda is always on sale in Denmark. ALWAYS! The two largest corporation consortiums will take turns having sale on Coca Cola and Pepsi. Since you do all your shopping at one place, quick, draw deals like soda works really well. So now you increase spenditure of customers, by making them think they're saving money, while screwing them over with giant markups. \n\n**I'm sorry if it's hard to read, I'm writing it at 00:30 AM, on a phone.**\n\nBut the deal is that instead of having a competitive market, with low prices that benefits the consumer surplus. You have a more restrictive, oligopoly market where the producer surplus is higher. Might even see monopolized tendencies. Which really doesn't benefit the consumer. \n\n**So beware of time limited offers.** They are most likely a show that the company doesn't want to compete on prices.\n\nThe best you, as a consumer, can look for is 'price-matching'. Since this is a direct display of competitiveness and therefore low prices.\n\n**Just to illustrate how bad this is.** A monopolized company, sets its prices where they equal marginal costs (MR = MC), this is where profits are highest. Intel and AMD are monopolized competitive producers. Meaning that they do compete, but truth be told; If you're an Intel guy, you only buy intel, if you're an AMD guy, you only buy AMD. They strongly dominate the field. \n\nWhen I was informed of this, Intel had 92% market share of the whole CPU market. So a giant monopoly to say the least. \n\nIntels markups on its CPU's lay at around 900%. So 90% of the cost of an Intel processor is clean profit. So take a 400 USD processor, 40$ went into making it, materials, salaries, information, technology etc. and 360$ into profits. \n\nTechnically speaking, if you could drive more companies into the field and make an competitive market, you could get your processors at about a tenth the price. \n\nNow think of Nvidia and AMD o. GPU's, Sandisk and Samsung of SSD's. Xbox and PlayStation.\n\nEverywhere you have a small, dominated field there's probably huge markups. **You'd be able to make a super, god-damned awesome machine for less cost of a graphics card at the current prices.** Of course markups varies, but the overall markup in hardware are quite high, because they are an high complexity good (ECI).",

    "body": "Strap yourself in ladies and germs... I worked as an installation technician in home security for 5 years and I can confidently tell you home security salesmen are the shadiest scum on the earth. They work in the business of \"keeping you safe\" so they already have a great facade to hide behind. \nWhat you may not know is that these guys have apps and databases that let them know specifically which houses to target. They have apps that have been specifically created to collect the ages of local residents based on private data collected, so they know which houses are elderly people which are their easiest targets. The second easiest is those who have been broken in to or burgaled recently. They have an app for that. Basically it's like the sex offender finder, but for those who would be more susceptible to their tactics because \"we've noticed a recent influx of robberies here in your neighborhood, oh you had a break in last year? I had nooooo idea. Let me come in and see what system you're working with\" \nNever let them in your house. I've watched their team meetings where They discuss the number one goal being to get inside the building. If they do that, they think they've made the sale. They can sell you from the doorstep if you're truly interested. Tell them to come back if it's raining out, don't pity them for being out in the rain. They chose to be out there selling that day and are counting on your generosity. \nThe shortest contract you can get with any major dealer is 3 years. They'll try and sell you on 5 or longer, but just know that you have three days to cancel that contract. After that, if you cancel you'll owe them the remainder of your contract amount (your monthly rate\u00d7the amount of months left) and they will collect. From you, your loved ones if you pass on, if you move and don't wanna take it with. These guys get paid at least 250-500 bucks per sale they make. And I've seen guys sell 5 in A DAY. \nThere's no motivation to actually help on that side of the industry. It's all a money grab. Giant companies buying each other out left and right. Company A starts up and goes out and scores 1000 customers in 2 years. They've met their goal so they sell to monitronics for a few million. Now you're with monitronics and you don't even know it. And a few years when monitronics comes to \"upgrade\" your system they're really just signing you in for another contract. There are even shady salesmen walking around pretending to be reps from your company, offering to upgrade with a contract signature but really just signing you to another company. \nThey're gonna tell you that your security system is FREE (as long as you put up their sign in your yard, because they have a \"special short time offer for advertising customers\") but that fucking system costs less than 500 bucks and they're definitely adding that in to your total contracted amount. The more devices you add, your monthly rate starts increasing.. why? More coverage? Nope. You're always paying for those devices whether or not they're advertised as free. \nOh and those device prices? Bullshit. Have them show you a piece of equipment(Honeywell Door window sensor for example) they will claim cost 2 points. Those points are equal to 30-50 dollars a piece, depending how much profit the salesmen wants to make off of them. Go look on Amazon while they're there and see how much that whole \"1000 dollar system\" really costs and see how red their face gets. \nI've loved shaming salesmen who lie to unsuspecting customers. I've helped people who have been lied to renegotiate and even told them to cancel if they've flat out been given 100% lies (which does happen unfortunately). Just don't trust security salesmen guys. They and the company they make money for have no interest in your well being. You're nothing but another 500 bucks to them in an hours work.\n\nTldr; security companies are targeting you and your neighborhoods and will say anything to get inside your house. Do not trust them. Buy and install your own system from home depot or amazon. You wouldn't believe how easy it is to set up a wireless security system without a provider that will deter any burglar who hears it go off.",

This keeps them from paying anyone overtime.\n\n\n* Providing job offers by annual salary, but calling a years worth of work 2100 hours. There are only 2080 working hours in a year so you will never make you annual salary, you will always be short paid by 20 hours a year.\n\n\n* For last minute work needed, posting job listing (for a position that doesn't exist) and asking interviewees to test their skills by completing a task. Then using that product to submit, followed by removing the job posting and calling the position filled. Yeah free labor.\n\n\n* Telling people (verbally, no papertrail) they need to work on federal holidays. ADP automatically had those holidays checked as time take, and they made it so no one could alter it, effectively taking away vacation time on top of the 20 hours a year they were shorting you. (Edit: Ironically, this was most commonly done on Labor Day, nearly every year.)\n\n\n* Providing incentives for early project completion and then instead of paying that stated cash bonus, giving a physical gift worth \"equal value\". I am the proud owner of a $50 GPS instead of a $500 bonus.\n\n\n* HR changing an employee role to include the responsibilities of an entire additional position with no notice to the employee. No need to give a raise, and now you get to fire them for not living up to their responsibilities.\n\n\n* In the same vain, this is more subtle but I caught on, changing great employee's official job titles to something grandiose with no comparable pay increase. It make it much hard for that person to get a job of equal pay because other employers will a) not want to give you a 50% pay increase or b) wonder why the Director of Finance was only making $50K a year.\n\n\n* When finances get tight, changing the policy on who is covered under the insurance policy and then asking for reimbursement for past years premiums for employees who now have SOs who fall outside the new policy (gay & common law relationships).\n\n\n* Telling people who to vote for (Edit: I'll bet you can guess which political party).\n\n\n* Forcing salaried employees to work 36 hours shifts under threat of firing, to complete projects.\n\nLet me know if anyone wants more, I can keep going.\n\nEdit: Couldn't figure out bullet formatting.\n",

After trying about everything, it got to the point where I'd come home at the end of work and wonder what he pawned to get drug money next. After I told him that I'd be here for him, but he had to get help. If he didn't its me or the drug. He admitted he needed help, so I sat down with him and started calling Richmond numbers (804 and neighboring 757). One place was very receptive to helping him, then we found out they were in Delray Beach Florida. I suspected something was up when one lady, after being told we didnt have the financial means to get him to Florida said \"Oh don't worry. We'll pay for the plane ticket.\" Then everyone we talked to after that was like \"Yeah, we don't pay for air fare.\" Every time we talked to someone else with that company, different prices were named (after plane ticket lady, the price plus airfare was $1800, then down to $700, then up, then down to $400), different promises were made, nothing was the same. Red flags started going off in my head like crazy, but my boyfriend was determined to get help and stay with me. The fact that they did that to us made me want blood. Here he is trying to get help, and they're toying with him making it seem like help is accessible, then pulling it away, then bringing it back, then repeat.\n\nThe totally absurd part, is after I took the phone \n(they would call 5-6 times a day at all hours) and told them off in late 2012 / early 2013 telling them \"I dont know what fucking game y'all are playing, but shove off.\" They continue to call roughly twice a month 5 years later asking if his other attempts at seeking sobriety have failed and if they can resume the intake procedure.\n\nAfter all of that, I still don't have a company name for them, but blanket-fuck rehab facilities in Delray Beach, Florida.\n\nEdit: Clarity.

While working there I was shopping for a new laptop and learned all the model numbers they sold were exclusive to the store.  One reason was to not have to follow their own price match guarantee since the lower priced computer you found had to have the same model number.  The other reason was that manufacturers that offered more than a 1 year parts & labor warranty wouldn't offer it on the model numbers sold through the store.  Best example was the laptop I ended up buying; it was an Asus laptop which at the time came standard from Asus with a 2 year parts & labor warranty and 1 year of accidental damage protection.  The laptop sold in the store with the same exact specs but a different model number only had a standard 1 year so they could try to add on the extended warranty sold in the store.\nI worked in the computer department there for 2 years and never bought anything more than cables there.",

When they call, put on your perkiest retail employee voice and say the following: \n\n\"Oh, $owner's not in/in a vendor meeting/talking with a customer! Here, let me grab some paper, what's your name and extension so they can call you back?\" \n\n*Actually write that stuff down,* repeat it back to them, give them an email address and let them know the owner will get in touch when they can, and when they hang up, throw the paper out and make a filter to shuffle anything from @yelp.com into your inbox's trash bin.\n\nYelp's call center employees only last a few months at most; Yelp's corporate structure puts impossible sales goals on them so only a rare few ever get full time work. They don't seem to keep updated records on correspondence, so you can keep using the same script over and over again when you invariably get a phone call from someone new. \n\nThe **first time** they call, screenshot the reviews on your Yelp page.\n\nInstruct your employees to do the same.",

Lots of overhead in our system from Union and Civil service employees with 30+ years of seniority.\n\nThey offered lots of incentives to switch (which on closer inspection were no advantage to anyone but my employer) and also offered to pay out accumulated vacation above the \"new\" limit as cash.  About 1/3 of the staff took the deal and are now renewable yearly.  Cue the random mass layoffs when budget requires.\n\nThey also changed the class for any new positions, so if you accept a promotion you're automatically re-classified to the yearly renewed type.  \n\n",

She asked 3 landscaping companies for quotes. Their bids:\n\n-One said $7,000\n\n-One said $15,000\n\n-One said \"nah, we won't/can't.\"\n\nHer elderly coworker was apoplectic and convinced that the last time it was done, they didn't pay more than $2,000. Conveniently, however, she couldn't remember the name of that company and couldn't find any paperwork from when it was done. \n\nOut of the blue, a business card from a landscaper appeared in our house's front door. She called the guy and asked if he could clear the business's shoreline. Turns out he was the same guy that did it before and did it the next day for $1500. The job was literally just cutting and clearing out all the growth. ",

We talked (conversation felt strained, he really just wanted to pitch his shitty MLM) for about 20 minutes before he over-eagerly launched into his pitch for some idiotic MLM that his whole family was doing.

So they have a choice of which jobs to take and if  there's jobs that will pay them 15,000 for a days work then there's no point them offering to do a day's work for you then less than 15.000.\n\nWhere maybe the old guy who can only clear and remove is never going to get those 15000 jobs so he charges at rate that works for him.",

Rather than go back to the restaurant he just went in to a nearby shop and tried to buy a pack of cigarettes. When they refused to take the bill he just took it to the next store and got his cigarettes for the same bill. I asked him why he didn't go back and complain he said \"For what? I got rid of it right here. Why would I want to go back and waste my time?\"\n\nSaw a lot more counterfeit bills since.

Even when there's 3 babies per 1 worker as required by law, babies often are left to cry for a little while so each baby can be fed, changed, or put to sleep. \n\nWhat saddens me is how long the babies are left to lay in their cribs to stare at the cieling most of the day. 8 hours in daycare, you can imagine how much babies under 8 months actually get attention other than to be fed, cleaned, or put to sleep.",
