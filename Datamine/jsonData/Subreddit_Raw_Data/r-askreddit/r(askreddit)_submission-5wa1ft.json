So just take it easy and do your thing\" \n\nThe rooster is off like a bullet and he runs to the hen house and fucks every single hen.  He dashes to the pond and fucks all the ducks.  He's just a blur around the farmyard fucking every animal he can.  The farmer is in awe at the rooster and thinks \"Wow, this really is the most amazing rooster ever!\"\n\nThe next morning, he wakes up and sees the rooster laying in the middle of the barnyard, stiff as a board, with buzzards circling over head.  \"Oh no!\" He yells and falls on his knees next to the rooster. \"Why did you overwork yourself so hard! I told you to take it easy!\" \n\nThe rooster opens one eye and points at the buzzards and whispers \"Shhh, They're getting closer!\"",

They kept to this ritual for many years until the mill where two of them worked shut down. There being no jobs about and mouths to feed, the two unemployed brothers soon decamped to the US to find work. Before leaving, the three brothers swore a vow to have a drink to each other's honor in their absence. The next Wednesday night, the brother who stayed behind showed up at the pub as usual. He asked the bartender for three pints to be set up all at the same time. The bartender didn't say a word and put the three pints on the bar and watched as the brother took a sip from each pint in turn. This became the new ritual with the remaining brother drinking a pint for each of his missing brothers while he nursed his own loneliness. One week, the brother shuffled in and to everyone's shock he asked two pints instead of three. For the longest time, no one could buck up the courage to ask him why he only had two pints in front of him. Fearing the worst, a gloom settled over the entire pub. Towards the end of the evening, the bartender, holding back a tear in his eye, asked the brother if everything was OK with his family. \"Oh, sure!\" Says the brother. \"Only, my doctor made me stop drinking this week\".

What's happening? Great to see you! Come on in for a beer!\"  Although impressed, Dave's boss is still skeptical. After they leave Cruise's house, he tells Dave that he thinks him knowing Cruise was just lucky.  \"No, no, just name anyone else,\" Dave says.  \"President Obama,\" his boss quickly retorts.  \"Yup,\" Dave says, \"Old buddies, let's fly out to Washington,\" and off they go.   At the White House, Obama spots Dave on the tour and motions him and his boss over, saying, \"Dave, what a surprise, I was just on my way to a meeting, but you and your friend come on in and let's have a beer first and catch up.\"  Well, the boss is very shaken by now but still not totally convinced. After they leave the White House grounds he expresses his doubts to Dave, who again implores him to name anyone else.  \"Pope Francis,\" his boss replies.  \"Sure!\" says Dave. \"I've known the Pope for years.\" So off they fly to Rome.  Dave and his boss are assembled with the masses at the Vatican's St. Peter's Square when Dave says, \"This will never work. I can't catch the Pope's eye among all these people.

Sure enough, half an hour later Dave emerges with the Pope on the balcony, but by the time Dave returns, he finds that his boss has had a heart attack and is surrounded by paramedics.  Making his way to his boss' side, Dave asks him, \"What happened?\"  His boss looks up and says, \"It was the final straw... you and the Pope came out on to the balcony and the man next to me said, 'Who the fuck is that on the balcony with Dave?'\n\nThis is my favorite joke.

He approaches St. Peter and says: \" From now on, the only way to get into heaven is for someone to die in an interesting way, I'll leave it to you to figure out what fits.\" \"OK... got it.\" says St. Peter\n\nThe first day the new policy is in place St Peter explains the rule to the first guy who begins to tell his tale: \"St Peter, Im a devoted husband, I love my wife but I could have been more attentive.  One day I decide to surprise her at home early with some flowers.  I walk in our bedroom to find her naked, the sheets a mess and a look of surprise on her face.\" Intrigued, St. Peter asked him to continue... \"So, I go nuts, I start breaking things, yelling, crying, demanding to know where the man is.  Suddenly I find him. He's holding onto the edge of our sixth floor apartment's balcony.  I go over, shouting at him and stomping on his fingers.  He pleads with me and yells back but he falls, all the way down.  But he lands in some hedge bushes and LIVES.  Well, I'm so upset and enraged I go to the kitchen.  I lift the REFRIGERATOR up, and throw it over the balcony.  The fridge lands on him and kills him.  The rush was too much for my heart, I have a heart attack and die...\" St. Peter, surprised at the story saw no problem at letting the man in Heaven.\n\nAs the day goes on St Peter hears more stories, some good, some bad.  Then quite unexpectedly he hears one that catches his attention...  \"Well St. Peter, I work out a lot, and take fitness seriously.  One day I'm running on my treadmill in my apartment.  I work up a good sweat and felt pretty good.  Suddenly my treadmill starts speeding up.  Panicked, I slip.  I tumble backwards, over my balcony.  By the grace of God I manage to grab onto the balcony beneath me.  THEN OUT OF NOWHERE this fat asshole starts screaming at me, stamping on my fingers and calling me a all sorts of names.  I lose my grip and fall all the way down to the ground.  By some great fortune I live... then a goddamn REFRIGERATOR falls on me....\" St. Peter, mouth agape at the incredible coincidence, decides the man has earned his entry and lets him on his way.\n\nThe day winds down and St Peter sees off the last of those eager to enter the Pearly Gates.  Just as hes about to shut down for the day one last soul arrives.  After a quick explanation of the new policy, the man gets a big, wide grin across his face. \" OK St. Peter, are you ready for this? Im naked, right? and hiding in a refrigerator...\"",

    "body": "The story of that guy who was driving home from a business trip. He had a pretty low paying job, so obviously doesn't have the best of cars.\nAfter a few hours of driving, he drives past a monastery. That kind with all the monks.\nAnd holy tits, his car breaks down right in front of the monastery. Being a man of God, he obviously figures, \"I bet the monks will let me stay with them while my car is repaired.\" So he goes to the front gate and knocks on the door. A man in robes answers. He tells the monk his predicament and the monk, being a monk, lets him stay the night, and even helps with repair costs for his car. While the business man is sleeping that night, he hears this strange noise. It just perplexes him, and for the life of him, he can't figure out what it is. He decides when he wakes up in the morning, he'll ask the monks about it.\nWhen he wakes up, he finds the monk who he met when his car first broke down, and asks him, \"Can you tell me what that noise I heard was last night?\"\nThe monk replies, \"I'm sorry, brother. I cannot tell you, for you are not a monk.\" The man accepts this. He thanks the monks for their graciousness, and goes about his way when he gets his car back. 3 years later, he is driving on another buisness trip. And wouldn't you know it, his car breaks down in front of the monastery again.\nAgain, he figures, he can stay the night. And, of course, the monks let him stay and offer him the same help as before.\nAnd once again, during the night, he hears that noise. He has no idea what it could be. He decides to ask the monk once again, with hopes that he would trust him more this time around. In the morning he meets the monk again, and asks, \"I'm sorry for asking again, but what is that noise!?\"\nThe monk replies, \"I cannot tell you, for you are not a monk.\" The man says, \"Alright! I'll become a monk! What do I need to do!?\"\nThe monk replies, \"I need you to travel the world, and count every blade of grass if you truly wish to become a monk.\"\nThe man swiftly accepts and leaves all of his worldly possessions behind him to travel the world on this mission.\nHe goes to all corners of the globe counting grass blades. After 50 years, he comes back to the monastery. He gives the monk accurate numbers and the monks give him monk-hood. And obviously, the first thing he wants to do is find out what that noise was. So he asks the head monk.\nThe head monk beckons him to follow him and he does. After a few minutes of walking through corridors and rooms, they happen upon a wooden door.\nThe man can hear the noise. He gets excited. The head monk hands him a brass key. He reaches with the key to the lock, and unlocks the door.\nThere is another door though. This time iron. And the monk hands him an iron key.\nThis happens again and again. So many types of doors and keys. Every thing you could imagine. Glass doors, gold doors. Everything Finally, they get to a door made of solid diamond. The noise is louder than ever. The monk hands the man the final key. He opens the door and finally sees what has been making the noise. But I can't tell you what it is, because you aren't a monk.",

For their summer concert, the orchestra is doing Beethoven's Ninth Symphony with a local community choir. \n\nOn the day of the concert, there is a combined rehearsal in the performance hall with orchestra and choir. It's bad, but the bumpkins don't know any better. The real problem comes when the air conditioning breaks down. This is Texas in the summer, so they have to get it fixed or they will die of heatstroke. While the repairman works on the AC, several huge box fans are brought in to make life bearable for the remainder of the rehearsal. The problem with the fans is that they make deafening noise, and they blow the conductor's score off his stand. He has to get some twine and tie the score down to his stand so he can read it. \n\nWell, rehearsal finishes. Not great, but it finishes. In the four-hour break between rehearsal and call time, the whole bass section and two of the cellists go out to a local bar and get completely shitfaced. To the extent that those two cellists never manage to get back to the concert hall. The bassists do eventually stagger back, twenty minutes late, outrageously drunk, barely able to recognize which end of the bow to hold, but the cellists aren't seen again till the next day. \n\nPerformance begins. It's bad. Not only are they not good musicians playing Beethoven's 9th, but they're dealing with bass players full of beer and two missing cellists. But they survive and the audience seems to appreciate it. Until the conductor raises his arms to begin the final movement, and the AC dies again. \n\nThe fourth movement of Beethoven's Ninth is over twenty minutes long. So they have to bring in those box fans again. And they're too loud and they have to get the twine for the score again. And at this point, it's pandemonium...\n\n...because it's the bottom of the Ninth, with the score tied, two out, the basses loaded, and the fans going wild!",

One day, we were driving to the market and a cow was in the road, so hit hit the brakes. The basket with all the eggs flew into the floorboard and they all broke. So the moral is: don't put all your eggs in one basket.\"\n\nNext, Rebecca comes up to tell her story:  \n\"My family also owns a farm and raises chickens. Recently, our chickens laid two dozen eggs, but we only got 17 chicks. So the moral of the story is: don't count your chickens before they're hatched.\"\n\nFinally, little Jimmy comes up and begins his story:  \n\"My uncle Bob was a Green Beret back in 'Nam. One day, he was in a chopper that got shot down. All he had on board was a machine gun, a machete, and a bottle of whiskey. Well, he didn't want the whiskey going to waste, so he finished off the bottle before they hit and the bottle broke. \n\n\"He found himself surrounded by 100 VC. He killed 70 of them with the machine gun before he ran out of bullets, another 20 with the machete til it broke at the tang, and the last ten with his bare hands.\"\n\nHorrified, the teacher asked, \"what kind of lesson can you learn from a horrible story like that?\"\n\nJimmy looked at her and replied, \"don't fuck with Uncle Bob when he's been drinking.\"",

The man is dressed in an expensive suit, has a beautiful supermodel hanging off each arm, and has a limo parked outside. But the man has an orange for a head!\n\n> The customer sits down at the bar and orders everyone a drink. He pays for it from a roll of hundreds and manages to get the attention of every woman in the place, despite having an orange for a head.\n\n> The bartender is not a man to pry, but he feels compelled to ask about this man's life.\n\n> \"Excuse me,\" says the bartender, \"I can't help but notice that you're obviously fabulously wealthy and irresistible to women, but you have an orange for a head. How did that happen?\"\n\n> So the man told his story.\n\n> \"A while back, when I was penniless, I was walking along the beach and saw an old lamp, half buried in the sand. I picked it up and gave it a clean, and POOF! out popped a genie. The genie explained that he had been trapped in that lamp for two hundred years, and that he was so grateful to me for freeing him that he would give me three wishes.\n\n> \"For my first wish I asked for an unlimited fortune. The genie said 'It is done!' and from then on, whenever I needed money, it was there.\"\n\n> \"For my second wish I asked for the attention of all the most beautiful women in the world. The genie said it was done, and since then I have been able to get any woman I wanted.\"\n\n> \"For my third wish -- and, this is the bit where I think I kinda messed up -- I asked for an orange for a head.\"",
