Who makes the test questions and what would the questions even be, the content of those could be incredibly telling about the person asking them, and could be agenda driven. I think successful parenting is getting that kid filled with reasonable ideas, useful knowledge and keeping it alive and healthy, however, maybe someone else would want to use the kid as some kind of statement piece to project their own inner agendas, who's right and who has the right. Not something a governing body should be deciding. So being a good parent is pretty subjective, especially depending on your specific context.  ",

It's not called home economics anymore- it's called Family and Consumer Science or FCS. I am certified to teach all of the following:\nParenting\nChild development\nHuman development\nFashion and interior design\nAll culinary from basic food prep to culinary arts\nPersonal finance from check writing to investment\nHospitality\nRelationships and counseling\n\n\nit's an elective course. Over half our student population takes three or more classes with me of their own free will. I rock obviously. But in other schools, where there's a larger population or whatever, kids don't take it because it's seen as a fluff class. In most states, THIS IS ALREADY PART OF THEIR ACCOUNTABILITY AND THEY MUST OFFER IT!!!!!!!!!!! Parents just don't want their kids to sign up!!!! \n\n\nNow, here's the thing, in my parenting class I'm not sitting around teaching kids to change diapers and pick cute outfits like they did back in the 50s. We spend about 1 class on that the entire year. The rest of the time I'm teaching child birth, nutrition for children, best educational practices for little ones, developmental psychology, medical terminology. The list goes on and on. It's a rigorous course and hard to pass. Because parenting is hard. And they need to know how to do more than wipe a kids butt. PLEASE, call your local high school and ask what classes they offer in their FCS department. It'll blow your mind. I currently offer Life skills (covers personal development, sex Ed, basic nutrition, basic finances, basic relationships skills and professionalism). Then I have human psych and dev, which covers psychology, sociology and the study of the human body. Then I have dietetics, which is a nursing level course on human nutrition. There's culinary 1 & 2 where kids run their own cafe in the school and they earn a culinary business license while in high school (like a real one. Not something I made up. It certifies them in Serv safe and allows them to open a business the moment they graduate), and I have relationships and marriage counseling, which covers everything from friendships to how to navigate a divorce. Oh and money skills too. Which the other FCS teacher does. \n\nPlease please please SIGN YOUR KIDS UP.",

When they made new questions to put on said tests, it was a 2-3 year process. The questions have to go to committees to make sure the wording is perfect, they have to do trial runs of the questions with small samplings of students, and they have people specifically hired to make sure that there is no unintentional bias in a question. It is not uncommon for questions to get thrown out entirely at one of these steps because it's just too hard to fix the problem with that question.\n\nExample: one of the questions on a high-school science standardized test was about feed production for livestock and which type of feed would be best for the animals. This question had to be sent back to the committee and re-written because some of the types of feed included in the question were not easily-recognized as actual food to people who had never grown up on farms (imagine using corn vs using millet, for example) and students were picking the familiar food (corn) because they thought the other food (millet) wasn't a real food. And they were saying that in their answers.\n\nSo yeah, even making that test in a way that isn't biased is going to take years.",

I may be young but I'm smarter then every theist on earth basically the show is also really deep when they said like no one was born for a reason I was so blown away as they must have big balls to say that on tv so I told my friends on minecraft and they agree too. LOL once when my mom took me to McDonald's I asked for the Mulan dipping sauce and the dumb bitch didn't even get the reference XD One time in class i evan shouted \"I'm PICKLE RIIIICK!\" and Mrs.Janice told me to go outside i fucking hate that cunt school is for dumb ppl just like what Rick said, i m too smart for such imbicells.

It's not really the scientific stuff that makes them feel smart, it's the protagonist's mental issues and it's questioning of what exactly is a mental issue. Also, a lot of people like the subversion of tropes within the plots, which is strongly connotatively charged with the idea of a genius who \"thinks outside of the box\".\n\nThis isn't to say it is especially smart, but rather it seems smart because it addresses things that are stereotypically smart, but I do believe it's a good show because it supplied an easily digestible, and even tasty delivery system by which you can  think about these concepts. And I think there is a case to be made that it is a better show than many other shows similar to it, because it fairly effectively displays a more nuanced view than you might find otherwise, under a different writer. \n\nAnd as far as feeling although it's worth it to pay attention, it has been officially stated in interviews and the like that the creators of rick and morty do want to supply people with something worth watching, and not making fun of them for paying attention to the media they consume.\n\nAlso it's just fun.",
