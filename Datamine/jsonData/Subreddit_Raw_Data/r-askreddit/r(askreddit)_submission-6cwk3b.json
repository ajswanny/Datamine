    "body": "I found my dad's will. I was on his computer while he was at work (actually  m searching for his porn) and ended up finding a strangely titled word document. At first it didn't seem like a big deal. It contained a note to each of his kids. It wasn't until I got to the last one, my youngest brother, that I realized it wasn't just a will. The start of that line read something along the lines of \"If anything is going to make me change my mind now it's writing this part\". I realized I had found my dad's suicide note. I was about 14 or 15 at the time and I had no idea how to go about talking to him about it. \n\nI decided to just keep it to myself. He started buying us gifts and stuff and I would get really scared and I still just kept it to myself. I remember one day on the weekend I woke up in my bed to a loud bang coming from my dad's room. I laid there in bed for probably half an hour frozen. Once I worked up the strength I went to his room and opened the door. \n\nHe wasn't in the bedroom. I was so confused until I saw that the bedroom window was open. What had happened is that there was a gust and the wind had slammed the door shut, but my paranoid brain had heard a gunshot. After that I was laughing hysterically and I don't have much memory of the day past that.\n\nShortly after this incident my dad had returned most of the gifts he bought us kids and I slowly started to believe that he had changed his mind. I never confronted him about it until last year, about 14 years or so later, but I never fully accepted that he was ok now.\n\nI called him distraught about a separate matter and he started talking to me about depression. He told me on his own about he had considered taking his life, and went in to detail about it, and all I could do was cry and tell him \"I know.\" We talked a lot longer after that and we were finally able to put it all to rest.",

    "body": "When I was in college I worked at an arcade/minigolf joint that seemed to give zero fucks about actually making money, but was never in any kind of financial trouble.  When I got hired, the owner **literally** said \"I pay minimum wage and I expect to get minimum work for it.\"  I worked the front counter, and collected money for the mini-golf and sold cups of coins (or you could just use the coin changer).  The till was completely busted and would be off by $50 or more in either direction no matter what you did.\n\nI realized very quickly that I could just pretend to ring up golf fees and cups of tokens and pocket the cash, so I'd pocket $30-40 every shift, and nobody seemed to give a shit.  One of the assistant mangers let me take a break twenty minutes after I'd just taken a break because some of my friends had shown up and wanted to smoke a bowl with me.  He was like \"That is totally more important than your job.\" It was *awesome*.\n\nThen one day I walked into the owners office while his secretary was recording figures in the ledger.  I can read upside down pretty well and it was very obvious that the figures she was recording had fuckall to do with the business we were doing.  We sold maybe $60 of golf fees a night, and maybe $100 in coin cups, but she was recording $600 and $1000 for each.  I commented on the discrepancy and quipped about how someone would think we were in the laundry business and she got *really* squirrely and told me to leave the office.\n\nThe next day the owner called me into his office and we had a very circumspect conversation about how much I was enjoying working there and enjoying the perks of the job, and I very much got the sense that he was trying to decide if I was going to tell anyone anything.  Apparently he decided I wasn't (and I wasn't), and so I kept working there.\n\nAbout a year later the owner was arrested for money laundering and we all got fired.  Still the best job I ever had.  The mob is an A+ employer, would work in fake business again.",

    "body": "About two years ago, there was a fire in a high rise apartment building across the street from where I was living. My boyfriend and I had friends living in the apartment building, so we rushed outside to see if we could find them. From our house, we couldn't see which floor the fire was on, but judging from the smoke, it appeared it was close to the top floor.\n\n Anyways, the apartment was mostly evacuated, and we did finally meet up with our friends, who were unhurt. We were standing around with the crowd  when a woman ran up to the firefighters and shouted \"My daughter! My daughter!\" Someone caught her as she collapsed to her knees in the street, crying and shrieking. A paramedic eventually escorted her away from the scene to an ambulance as the fire fighters brought out a woman strapped to a stretcher. We all thought this was the daughter, but then a firefighter came out of the 14th floor window with a small child in his arms. It was a young girl, and he carefully handed her to his partner to take down the ladder to safety before disappearing back into the apartment. As the second firefighter carried her slowly down the ladder, more than a few of us wondered why he was taking so long. As he neared the ground, a collective gasp went up from the crowd: the little girl was limp, and looked as though she was asleep, but on closer inspection, we could see that her skin was grey-blue in colour. The firefighter put the girl on a stretcher, and the paramedics began a half-hearted attempt at CPR to appease the crowd as they rushed to the ambulance. But they knew, as we all did in our hearts, that the little girl had perished in the fire.\n\nNot long afterwards, a stretcher was brought out of the building with a large man on it. He, too, was blue-grey in colour. This time no attempt at CPR was made as he was wheeled away to the ambulance. It was later reported in the newspaper  that the man on stretcher was the girl's father. The little girl had been playing with the stove, and had hidden in a closet because she thought her parents would be angry with her. He had died trying to save her, even though he had cerebral palsy and used a wheelchair.\n\nThat was the day I learned my lesson about rubbernecking at an accident or fire. \n\nEdit: grammar, spelling\n",

To clarify the matter, let me tell you guys the story: \nMy mom died in a car accident because she pulled me out of the way of a speeding car. I was 11 years old. I will always remember the image of she bleeding on the street. It was so unreal that I didn't even cry until years later. Some people called an ambulance and took me back home. \n\nAfter that, I just remember blurry things that happened months and months later: my dad trying not to cry at my mother's funeral, my siblings completely devastated, some kind of interrogations by police officers, and so on. \n\nI believe they found the driver but, by then, my father was already too overwhelmed to take legal action. Moving on several years later, I was probably 16-17 and looking into my dad's archive some personal documentation about myself in order to submit a college application. \n\nHe keeps everything in this old archive, so I'm just going thorough all the documents. Out of nowhere, I open this folder and I got dead cold: pictures of my mother lying on an operation table completely naked and bold shave. With those incisions and openings that I had only seen in movies or television. Alongside the report with the cause of death. I could not even pronounce those words and I was freaked out by the photos. I put back the folder and ran away. \n\nWe ended up moving out from that house, and I'd never seen those papers again. ",

The boy/girl ratio was roughly the same so we basically divided the manor into the boy and girl halves, each with chaperones.\n\nOne of the nights I got up to go to the bathroom and had walk across a long hallway which had lots of windows. From a certain point I could see into the room where one of the female chaperones slept. She wasn't super hot or anything, but she was reasonably attractive and fairly young.\n\nI saw her looking out of the window and smoking a cigarrete while she was topless. This was the first time in my life I've seen real life boobies so I just stood there transfixed. She couldn't see me because the hallway was totally dark so she just kept on smoking and being lost in thought.\n\nOne of the male chaperones heard me leave so after a while he got worried that maybe I got lost or was trying to sneak into the girl's half. He came looking for me and when he found me in the hallway he also saw her just standing there. We both exchanged looks, he grinned and said \"Wow.\" I then proceeded to use the bathroom and went back to bed. On my way back she had already retreated into her room.\n\nOf course being a middle school boy I told all my friends the following morning, but at the request of the male chaperone I left out the part where he also saw her. I became an instant hero and was made to retell the story in extreme detail for days to come. \n\nThe following night a few of the boys tried sneaking out to get a peek, but the male chaperone was probably expecting this and basically made sure we just went to the bathroom and weren't idling around to catch a peep.",

Expected this to be buried. To answer some questions about leaving quietly, I was just in shock at first and most likely stoned (hence the late night kitchen trip). I remember watching them for a minute and then just being like \"eh, fuck them\" and leaving. It went from \"he is groping my girl\" to \"look at these two shitty people I don't need in my life\" real quick. And at the time it seemed important to not give them a chance to spew excuses to me and feel better about it because it wouldn't matter what they said. And the longer I didn't talk to them, somehow the more cathartic it became. If it happened to me today, I don't know I'd manage that. That said, it was a long time ago and I hold no long-term ill feelings toward them. In the big picture of awful things people do to each other, it sucked but lots of people have worse stuff done to them all the time and I ended up with a pretty great life.

After a few minutes, a male janitor walked in and started cleaning the bathroom.  Another minute later, another male janitor came in to help.  They were talking to each other in Spanish and then started kissing near the sinks, not realizing anyone was in the bathroom.  I just sat there silently for a while not knowing what to do.  After another minute or two of heavy kissing between the two, I decided to make a few noises so that they knew they weren't alone.  My toilet seat creaked when I moved.  They both stopped their romance session, looked at my stall, giggled, and ran out of the bathroom leaving all of their cleaning stuff behind.  I quickly cleaned up, flushed and ran out.  I actually never saw those same janitors again.",

    "body": "My neighbour staring at her rumoured lover with such longing and unrequited love in her eyes it bugs me to this day.\n\nBackstory: I live in a courtyard w 3 apartment buildings. My building has 4 two bedroom apartments. The landlady lives in another of the buildings, in a one bedroom.\n\nAcross the street, the landlady's son owns/lives in an apartment building of his own.\n\nThe apartment next door to me houses a couple [33M] and [28F], with their children, [10F] and [4M]. They're\u200b immigrants, and have a longstanding relationship w the landlady; the pay a slightly lower rent, and they manage the buildings when she travels, like 6 months out of the year. The guy runs a construction crew, so he does odd jobs, and his wife stays at home. (All this to say, the families know each other. There's a class difference, which is important to these people, but they've been in each others orbit for years).\n\nWhen I moved in, my neighbour was pregnant with the little boy. Ffwd to his birth, he's pretty light skinned. (For context, these ppl are of south Asian descent, dark brown complected). Lots of babies grow into their colour, so no big. Four years later, he's still notably lighter than his sis and parents.\n\nMy mom told me that there were rumours circulating about the kids paternity, but I am not one to get into ppl's business or in that kinda drama, so I didn't pay attention.\n\nAnd then I get a look at the supposed father. This happens when the boy is prob 2. The landlady's son comes to see his mom, and I was leaving the courtyard. Little boy looks a lot like him; most telling is the colouring they share. I would later see his own children; his son and the neighbour's could be brothers. \nMy mom makes friends with the neighbours, and we become somewhat close. I have my own baby, we interact regularly.\n\nOne day I'm taking my daughter out in her stroller, I pop over to tell the neighbour I'm leaving, as I normally do. Her door is open, but her screen door is closed. She's sitting on the ground, staring up at the landlady's son, who is playing with her (possibly his) son. The look on her face... I've never seen such naked longing and happiness on someone outside of the movies. I felt like I was intruding on a super private moment. Her eyes lit up, and she looked years younger, it was definitely a 'huh' moment. He wasn't even looking at her, and I'm sure she didn't realise she had that look on her face. I quietly backed away without saying anything and left. \nShe's never said anything to me about her son's paternity, but there was some scandal when someone sent a pic of the man and her son, side by side, to her husband and the confrontation was apparently ugly. I look at her sometimes and I remember that unguarded moment, and know that I definitely wasn't supposed to see it.",

    "body": "I stumbled across a major case of fraud in my company.  The owners son (J) was recently released from jail and needed to find adequate housing for himself to be able to be paroled.  Someone in my company, I don't know who, went into Quickbooks and edited 4 weeks of paychecks for an employee (K) to make it look like they belonged to J.\n\nI only found out because J had asked if I could scan and email them to his potential landlord.  I didn't really think twice about it at first, but after talking to the bookkeeper and realizing things weren't adding up, I went in to take a look and discovered what was done.  \n\nI forwarded a copy of the forged checks to my personal email from the work email, but other than that, I don't know how to handle this situation.  Saying anything at all could result in me losing this job and I sure as shit cannot afford to not be working or making any less than what I make right now.\n\nEdit:  So there are some things that I should add that I also know about this company and the owners that I neglected to add in the original post.  A lot of people are telling me that this isn't really fraud and I can see your point.  The reason I used that word is because I have witnessed first hand the owners stealing from the customers and because of that, I can't help but feel like that word is appropriate for all of their business dealings.  Our business includes sales and I've watched the owners sell to their customers and have them either pay in cash or write checks made out to their personal accounts and not the business ones.  If any of these customers were ever to look at our company records, there wouldn't a single record of them ever having done business with us.  No legal contracts were signed.  No records of payments received or deposited.  Their customer information isn't even kept with the rest of the legitimate customer files.  They're kept in a locked drawer in the owners office, so that he can keep them separate and knows which ones he can keep going back to for under the table cash.\n\nEdit 2: Since I'm still getting comments on this from people telling me that IT will find the email, let me assure you they wont.  Wanna know how I know they wont?  Because I'm the resident IT person.  ",

There's a handful of guys all in pants and shirts, with beards and scarfs around their necks. The next thing I notice is (I presume) a local, in local clothing with his hands tied behind his back and a hood on. NO ONE IS SAYING ANYTHING TO ME. I don't want to ask anything. I just want to get the fuck off this aircraft. \n\nAfter a bit the aircraft lands at Speicher, but not on the flight line. They landed in some random open space on the FOB (Speicher is gigantic).

A couple of the other girls in that clique giggled, and she quickly closed her shirt up, the whole thing lasting maybe 2-3 seconds.  No one else said a thing; the teacher didn't see anything and just kept teaching.  As far as I know, I'm the only one who saw anything.  None of those girls even saw me looking.\n\nThat was a HUGE thing for 12-year-old me to see, so I still remember it perfectly 25 years later - how her hair was done that day, the shirt she was wearing, what her bra looked like.

    "body": "So LPT if you work in a job that can have shit you cant talk about happen, establish a code word or phrase and then never abuse it for personal reasons.\n\nFor example, wife: \"where the fuck are you, its 2am and you never came home from work\" husband: \"sorry my beloved, wombats ate my salad\"\n\nThis tells her you are ok, somewhere in Africa and will be home for tea next Sunday after showering jungle sweat and the blood of insurgents off your person.\n\nIf she is the suspicious type, bring something nice for them from a duty free shop\n\nEdit: holy crap this took off! Glad people's love of wombats hopefully got them to see and adopt this good practice.\n\nIt is actually real LPT advice, with an obvious bit of humor.  But saying something that does not sound out of place to those that my be listening, but stands out to your SO/kids/parents works best.  Great thing for kids to have to so that they can bail from a bad sitaution without feeling lile a NARC or being \"uncool\"\n\nHave phrases or codewords for \"all is well, but cant talk now\", \"everything has gone to shit, need immediate extraction\" \"will be out of contact for a bit, dont worry\" ect.",
