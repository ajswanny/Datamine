Stanislav Petrov, the duty officer at the command center at that time,  was tasked with observing the satellite early warning network and notifying his superiors of any impending nuclear missile attack against the Soviet Union. If notification was received from the early warning systems that inbound missiles had been detected, the Soviet Union's strategy was an immediate and compulsory nuclear counter-attack against the United States.\n\nPetrov dismissed the warning as a false alarm. He deduced that a first-strike nuclear attack by the United States was likely to involve hundreds of simultaneous missile launches in order to disable any Soviet means of a counterattack. His suspicion was confirmed when no missiles arrived at the proposed time of impact. \n\nLater, it was determined that the false alarms were caused by a rare alignment of sunlight on high-altitude clouds and the satellites' Molniya orbits, an error later corrected by cross-referencing a geostationary satellite.\n\nSo the only reason why civilization as we know it didn't cease to exist in 1983 was the level-headed behavior of a single man.",

This is a widely accepted part of physics, with practical concerns; for example, it's making the production of smaller computer components much more difficult than it would otherwise be. The smallest parts are already so small that electrons are simply \"ignoring\" the gaps in individual open circuits.  \n  \nThe Higgs Boson is a subatomic particle which gives the property of mass to other particles. Scientists believe that it may exist in a state of false stability -- like an already-burned piece of wood, but one that's been doused in gasoline, so it can actually burn again if provided with a spark. In this case, quantum tunneling could provide that spark. If one Higgs Boson starts dropping to a lower-energy state, it will release a tremendous amount of energy in an expanding spherical wave, [one that will swallow and annihilate everything it touches](https://youtu.be/ijFm6DxNVyI) (youtube) as the chain reaction affects every HB particle it encounters. The wave will expand at the speed of light, forever, and what remains inside will be a universe of altered, unrecognizable physics and chemistry. \n\nThis phenomenon is called \"vacuum decay.\" It's not proven, but the math holds out: basically, if it's accurate, then there is a type of particle that exists which could potentially destroy the entire universe if *one of them* exhibits a type of behavior that *other particles exhibit all the time*.

    "body": "Piggybacking off of your comment to talk a little more about intracranial [in the head] aneurysms [weakness in a vessel wall].  The usual caveats apply: IANAD, IANYD, see your doctor with any questions that specifically apply to you; all of the info here is general only. \n\n/u/ion_force is absolutely right that aneurysms are scary, and can just suddenly cause badness. \n\nTo be a little more detailed, it's not (usually) the aneurysm that you worry about. It's what happens when it ruptures. An *aneurysm* is basically just a weakness in the wall of a blood vessel. \n\n---\n\n**Starting with the scary stuff**: About 3-6% of the population [[1]](http://stroke.ahajournals.org/content/46/8/2368.long) [[2]]( http://www.aafp.org/afp/2002/0815/p601.html) has an unruptured aneurysm, or an aneurysm that's just sitting there. People who have them probably don't know; most of the time, they don't cause symptoms. We have some imaging tests that can show an aneurysm, but every test has risks and costs, and it's not generally recommended to just screen people at random[[1]](http://stroke.ahajournals.org/content/46/8/2368.long). (Screening might be a good idea in some people, like those with immediate family with aneurysms[[3]]( https://www.bafound.org/about-brain-aneurysms/diagnosis/early-detection-and-screening/), or those with certain medical conditions[[4]]( http://www.bmj.com/content/339/bmj.b3763) ). \n\nWell, that's scary. **What's the good news?** The good news is that a lot of these aneurysms aren't destined to rupture. Aneurysms that are small, or in certain locations, or aren't growing over time, those aren't as likely to rupture[[5]]( http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM199812103392401#t=abstract), [[6]]( https://news.yale.edu/2017/06/06/risk-rupture-small-brain-aneurysms-low-study-finds). In aneurysms that seem like they are at high risk for rupture, there are some surgical procedures (clipping and coiling) that can \"secure\" the aneurysm, making it much less likely to \"pop\" (ie rupture, or cause badness)[[1]]( http://stroke.ahajournals.org/content/46/8/2368.long) [[7]]( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16139655). \n\n**More scary news**: if the aneurysm ruptures, that's really bad. An aneurysm that ruptures causes a type of brain bleed called a subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), which is probably what unfortunately happened to /u/tinwhiskerSC's friend and /u/chowder7116's mom (I'm sorry for your loss. SAH sucks). There's a lot of mortality (death) and morbidity (problems but not death) after ruptured aneurysms[[8]]( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4556224/). But doctors are getting better at treating people with SAH. \n\n---\n\n##So what can I do?##\n*First*, don't freak out. It's a scary thing, it's probably important to know about, but it's not as common as lots of other problems[[9]]( https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/deaths.htm) (SAH from a ruptured aneurysm is lumped into that \"stroke\" category; it's a small percentage of strokes). That headache that you had yesterday is probably a migraine or a hangover, and not anything to lose sleep over. \n\n*Second*, if you're worried about it, talk to your doctor. IANAD, IANYD. If you are worried, talk to your doctor.\n\n***Third*, and this one's really important, reduce your risk**. How do you reduce your risk of a ruptured aneurysm?\n\n* **control your blood pressure**. /u/Neez_Dutss talked about aneurysms as the silent killer. High blood pressure is a silent killer (also crodcodiles. You should avoid those too).   \n\n* **stop smoking**.  Yes, it's hard to quit. Yes, it's still really important to quit.  \n\n**Both smoking and high blood pressure make you more likely to develop an aneurysm *and* make it more likely for one you have to rupture**. [[10]](https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/arm/prevention) [[11]](https://www.bafound.org/about-brain-aneurysms/risk-factors/) They also play a role in 4 of the 5 leading causes of death in the United States [[9]]( https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/deaths.htm). If you can get those two things under control, you're a LOT more likely to have a longer, healthier life. \n\n---\n\nI don't know if this will get read, buried under the 200 comments on the OP's, but I hope it helps someone. \n\nEdits: mostly for fomatting and some minor wording",

Futurists talk about the singularity, where one day people can merge with machines, What if, long after that, we don't even need machines, we develop the ability to somehow exist as bodyless minds free to roam the universe. Then later still we develop the ability to transcend time as we as we transcend space. So that we can go back anf forward in time at will. Then later still we find ways to manipulate matter as we see fit, so a group of us go back to a time before the universe existed and put these abilities to use by beginning the universe. Then future humans could exist, as bodyless minds watching over the universe from its inception, maybe silently guiding events to make sure that humans evolve and the circle completes. And in this universe, when each person dies their mind actually gets picked up by future technology and they join the future hoard of bodyless humans. So that in the end the reason for the existance of the universe is us, and we create an afterlife for ourselves too. ",

It's a big supply of fresh water if your abductors don't think of giving you water right away (or try to coerce you by thirst).\n\nEDIT: after several replies: I'm dumb. You could just use the toilet and drink from the tank.\nIn the context of the story though, since the dome basically engulfed all the town including underground, it probably cut the power and water supply so he wouldn't be able to flush? I can't remember.\n\nEDIT2: people who actually have knowledge of jail toilets are telling me that sometimes there's no accessible water tank, so in the shitter it is! And for those disgusted by this, wait until it's been 2 days without a single drop of water.",

My dad was having this issue where part of his vision would cut out while he was running. It wasn't painful and it wasn't debilitating or anything like that, but it was noticeable and worrisome. My mom was in nursing school at the time and did a TON of research. She thought he had MS and asked for a referral to get him tested. \n\nPrimary care doctor said no, and even told her that she shouldn't be too confident in this just because she's in nursing school. Really belittled the shit out of her.\n\nThey went to a new doctor. Same thing. Nope, cut it out, you're not even a nurse, stop playing doctor.\n\nFinally someone heard her out and tested my dad. What do ya fucking know, he had MS that was targeting his optic nerves first or something weird like that.\n\nMy dad hasn't progressed even a little bit since his diagnosis since we got him to get treatment so early. Had they listened to the first few doctors, he'd likely be in a wheelchair 10 years earlier than he had to be.\n\nYou know your body well. It's okay to annoy the doctors. They aren't doing you a favor, you're *paying* them. They aren't magical wizards, they can get things wrong. ",

The third is that moment, sometime in the future, when your name is spoken for the last time.\n\nSo you wait in this lobby until the third death. There are long tables with coffee, tea, and cookies \u2013 you can help yourself. There are people here from all around the world, and you can try to strike up a conversation with whomever you'd like. Just be aware that your conversation may be interrupted at any moment by the Callers, who call out your conversations partner's name to indicate there will never again be another remembrance of him by anyone on the Earth. Your partner slumps out, face like a shattered and re-glued plate, saddened even though he's kindly told by the Callers that he\u2019s off to a better place. No one knows where that better place is, or what it offers, because no one exiting through that door has returned to tell us. Tragically, many people leave just as their loved ones arrive, since the loved ones were the only ones doing the remembering. We all wag our heads at that typical timing.\n\nThe whole place looks like an infinite airport waiting area, but the company is terrific. There are many famous people from history books here. If you get bored, you can strike out in any given direction, past aisles and aisles of seats. After many days of walking, you'll start to notice that people look different, and you'll hear the tones of foreign languages. People congregate amongst their own kind, and what one sees is the spontaneous emergence of territories that mirrors the way they were set up on the surface of the planet. With the exception of the oceans, you\u2019re traversing a map of the Earth. Along with no oceans, there are no time zones either. No one sleeps here, even though they mostly wish they could. The place is evenly lit by fluorescent lights.\n\nNot everyone is sad when the Callers shout out their names, when they call as though announcing the next flight departure. On the contrary, some people beg and plead when the Callers enter. They prostrate themselves at the Callers\u2019 feet as the next names are read out. These are generally the folks who have been here a long time, too long, and especially those who are remembered for unfair reasons. For example, take the farmer over there, who drowned in a small river 200 years ago. Now his farm is the site of a small college, and the tour guides each week tell his story. So he\u2019s stuck and he\u2019s miserable. For the more his story is told, the more it drifts. He is utterly alienated from his name; it is no longer identical with him, but continues to bind. The cheerless woman across the way is praised as a saint, even though the roads in her heart were convoluted. The gray haired man at the vending machine was lionized as a warhero, then demonized as a warlord, and finally canonized as a necessary firebrand between two moments in history. He waits with aching heart for his statues to fall. And that is the curse of this room: since we live in the heads of those who remember us, we lose control of our lives and become who they want us to be.\n\nDavid Eagleman",

Among the horrors of radiation poisoning and the initial firestorm, he uncovered one \u2018creature\u2019 unique to the atomic wasteland: the \u2018ant-walking alligators\u2019.\n\n>They had once been human. When the sky exploded, they\u2019d had the misfortune to survive. Faces turned to the blast, the skin had been seared from their skulls; leaving only a black, leathery substance without eyes or features. All that remained was a red hole where their mouths had once been. They staggered about the outskirts of Hiroshima, avoided by other survivors \u2013 but the real horror was the sound they made. According to Pellegrino:\n\n>**\u201cThe alligator people did not scream. Their mouths could not form the sounds. The noise they made was worse than screaming.** They uttered a continuous murmur \u2014 like locusts on a midsummer night. One man, staggering on charred stumps of legs, was carrying a dead baby upside down.\u201d\n\n[NSFW/NSFL source with upsetting picture of a survivor front and center as soon as you click.](http://knowledgenuts.com/2013/07/17/forgotten-horrors-ant-walking-alligators-of-hiroshima/) ",
