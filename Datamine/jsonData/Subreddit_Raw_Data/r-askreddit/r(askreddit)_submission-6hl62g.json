    "body": "For the sake of an answer, I'll characterize this as receiving rapid regeneration. A gun shot to the head will still kill you, but short of death your body heals completely in, say, a week. This is what I do:\n\n 1. I am stranger in a strange land. I have no skill in making anything useful--not with the tools of this age--and my body is ill-suited for hard labor. I decide to go from farm to farm until someone is willing to give me simple work that can be communicated without words. At least my regeneration will help me recover quickly.\n 2. I am kicked off a farm almost immediately. Within an hour or two it is obvious that I'm slower than a ten year old child of this time, and the farmer has no desire to share his hard-grown food with this oddly-garbed, weak-limbed creature. I have learned two words which I believe mean \"barn\" and \"worthless piece of shit\" (or something of that nature); I cannot pronounce either, but I repeat them as I walk.\n 3. I am near a city and the farms are blessedly close. Even so it takes close to a full day before I find another farm that allows me to do some work. My benefactor this time is grizzled and care-worn, yet I think he is touched by my helplessness. I work a few hours and eat for the first time, the flavors strange and bland to my palate. My vocabulary gains a few more words, but most of the communication is through hand gestures, though even that is surprisingly difficult. I sleep in the barn, rain dripping though the slats keeping me awake long into the night.\n 4. I had the good fortune to arrive during planting season. As I grow accustomed to the work, I feel I am less of a burden than I was at first. Perhaps I am even, barely, earning my keep. But, more to the point, my vocabulary is improving considerably and I am now speaking in short, simple sentences.\n 5. The summer is busy for me. I know I cannot stay here; after harvest I will need to find other accommodations. I know that learning to write is of the utmost importance, but there are no books to be found. Instead I slowly, painfully copy characters I see written wherever I find them, practicing them with the burnt ends of sticks on rock until I can form them quickly, even if I do not know their meaning.\n 6. My benefactor, who has the habit of occasionally looking on as I practice my \"writing\", surprises me one day we are in the city. He introduces me to a man whose function I do not really grasp, but who seems to be some sort of clerk. In any case, he is willing to write out some sentences and tell me what they mean. His accent is new to me, the vocabulary strange, and I drink it in. This man has some education. I use my charcoal collection to write the translations in English and he asks what language it is. I have no answer, so I tell him I made it up. He laughs. For many nights after, I copy these passages again and again.\n 7. I visit the clerk at every opportunity. The farmer is understanding. He is kind, and seems to care about me, but I also see relief in his eyes that I will not ask to stay the winter. The clerk has become a friend, and he willingly supplies me with new words and corrects my fledgling script. Luckily, the script is simple and rather flexible--much simpler than English--and my progress is rapid.\n 8. My writing has become quite serviceable, and well that it has, because the harvest is done and the preparations for winter have begun. I still work much of each day, but soon I will need to find new accommodations. The clerk, who it turns out takes dictations from the wealthy and illiterate, helps me find a job doing inventory and bookkeeping for a successful shop. It pays so little that I can scarcely afford to house, feed, and clothe myself, but I have ready access to quill pens and now my real work can begin.\n 9. On wood, stone, and any other surface I can find, I begin writing down everything I remember. About textiles, manufacturing, mathematics, psychology, history, and medicine. I write in English, and in great detail, developing a shorthand for my relative certainty about these facts.\n 10. Over the next several years, my education proves invaluable. The owner of the shop, at first scornful of my work, becomes, if not a friend, then at least an ally. I show him how to reduce inventory carrying costs using LEAN techniques and predictive forecasting of purchasing trends. I introduce a formal loyalty program, employ (relatively) sophisticated product pricing strategies, and he is generous in rewarding me as his wealth burgeons. The clerk is happy for my success at first, and I even try to help him, but the role reversal does not suit him well and we stop spending time together. When he dies a few years later, I don't even know. The farmer I visit occasionally. It is awkward, but I owe it to him. The shop purchases most of what he produces at a good price, and that is perhaps the only meaningful thing I give to him before he dies, quietly, eight years after I arrived.\n 11. It is during this time that I sow the seeds of wealth. I save every coin I can and found an informal bank. I am allowed to operate out of the shop owner's buildings in exchange for a 20% share of profits. He is skeptical at first, but it costs him nothing. By the time he dies, nearly 30 years later, it is more than half his annual earnings, according to the quasi-accounting team I now employ. I purchase the business from his widow for a sizable sum, sufficient to keep her in comfort for her few remaining years.\n 12. It takes time to find and train someone to handle the day-to-day management of the bank and the shop (still known as such, though it has expanded a dozen times and offers the finest and most varied wares in the city), but once accomplished, I turn my attention to my new project: a university. I pay to build it, but the ongoing costs are covered by the students, mostly the children of the obscenely wealthy. I need to be careful--some of my ideas could draw the wrong kind of attention--but I begin rigorously training them in the scientific method, drawing on every elementary school experiment I can remember. I find I enjoy this. Aside from some dalliances, I lead a fairly solitary existence. The children make me feel connected, meaningful.\n 13. It is time to deal with the issue of not aging. I establish a bank and university in two cities perhaps a month's journey away from each other and begin passing myself off as my own son or grandson. Every twenty years or so I rotate, managing the affairs of the other location by correspondence. Some of the students have grown up and become teachers. This is both heartwarming and inconvenient.\n 14. I have good paper now, just one of the many fruits of my universities. I publish a \"book of prophecy\", in which I attempt to capture all my recollections of science and phrase it as if they were clever guesses. This is perhaps all I can do to guide and hasten their progress. I continue to write down my memories, but I have not remembered anything new in a very long time.\n 15. I fall in love. She is young--everybody is young, when you have lived a century and a half--and she is bright, and she worships me, yet speaks to me candidly and without guile. Before I ask her to marry me, I tell her the truth about who I am, something I have never done before. I show her the vast piles of writings, copied and recopied in an ever greater expanse, organized and re-organized, indexed and cross-referenced a hundred ways. She does not believe me. She is not cruel, but she leaves the university soon after and I do not see her again for many years. For the first time, I contemplate death.\n 16. Impatient with the rate of progress, I use my wealth and prestige to forge a political career. I have no wish (or facility) to run a nation, but I advise, and my banks give my words weight. I do my best to resolve conflict and establish universities in every allied country. The thing I remember with the sweetest nostalgia, other than air conditioning and hot water, is TV shows. It is a bizarre, ridiculous thing to work toward, but I throw my wealth and centuries and harness the combined intellectual power of every major nation to make me some damned [talkies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_film). It takes a long, long time.\n 17. It is 750 years before the world is \"modern\" in my eyes, though history has taken a vastly different shape. We had no dark ages, no long stretches of stagnation. For all the many gaps in my knowledge, there are always brilliant minds to discover--or even to leapfrog--the reality I recorded, which now seem another man's writing. I assume different identities now, controlling my enterprise through elaborate mechanisms of separation. My personas are primarily political as I continue to try to guide events. I succeed, though less with every passing century. I wonder, sometimes, if I should let loose the reigns, now that I have nothing to offer other than my accumulated wealth.\n 18. It is my 900th birthday, to the best of my reckoning, when I set foot on Mars. It is already lightly colonized, and nearly everyone is there to greet me. Late that night, I step out an airlock in my suit and for the first time in centuries I am captivated, utterly transfixed. The night sky is blacker than I ever imagined, the stars fervent pin pricks of light. My suit protests as I remove my helmet, the sounds of my gasps intertwining with the sounds of the alarms. I live longer than any other man could have, I suppose, my cells eagerly rushing to right themselves, but soon I meet the same end as everyone I have ever known. I try to remember the face of the farmer, the clerk, the shop owner. I try to summon the face of the woman I loved, but cannot. Indeed, I find I can remember nothing at all worth remembering, as if I had slowly consumed their meaning over the endless years.\n\nEdit: Fix words. Also thanks guys. :)  ",

Trade over a wide area should make someone receptive to speaking to a stranger.  \n\n[Edit:  Oops.  I did my math wrong and was off by 1000 years.  These are 2000 BC cultures, not 1000 BC.  1000 BC would drop the Minoans and replace them with Mycenaean Greeks & Phoenicians, the Beakers would have split into more regional cultures, the Zhou would replace the Shang, the Kush would succeed Kerma.  Everyone else would still be around, though.  The Israelites would be a thing now.]\n\nAlso, hospitality to strangers on the road was considered an iron-clad rule of Bronze Age social mores in most of the world.  People were expected to welcome in a stranger and give them food and a place to rest.  I'm not sure how well this extends to people you can't speak to, but it should be something you can rely on when you've gotten some simple phrases under your belt.\n\nBesides, you have millennia to learn.  Spending a decade as an unsophisticated laborer would be enough to get started on learning at least one language, and you can go from there.",

Sure I don't know the specifics of modern farming techniques, but I just launched the world's farming technique ahead by 2,000 years. It's 1017 BC. You underestimate how much of the world you can change at that time.

The up-and-Coming powerful people will always have looked at you as a patriarchal figure, an uncle who has played a serious role in your upbringing.  This will secure you a very comfortable position in society, and past this point you won't have to do much hard work outside of maintaining your social capital. That's when you start doing magic (but not a second sooner). \n\nAssuming you carry your present day knowledge to the past with you, you can do a whole bunch of things that will blow people's minds and that they will only be able to explain as magic. Build a steam engine, build a telescope, \"invent\" calculus, glassblowing, shipbuilding, etc. Even if you can't do this stuff right now, you have basic scientific knowledge and hundreds of years with nothing to do, eventually you'll figure out something that will be considered magic. \n\nThe problem is, you cant come right out the gates doing magic. If you do, you are a demon or evil sorcerer and you'll be killed or ostracized. If you pull the same stuff as an old respected community leader, then bam you are a benevolent divine wizard and everybody will love you forever.

But before doing it, Michaelson had pushed the Nil button on his Jaunt board, erasing each and every one of the hundreds of thousands of possible portals through which Mrs. Michaelson might have emerged - anywhere from neighboring Reno to the experimental Jaunt-Station on Io, one of the Jovian moons. So there was Mrs. Michaelson, Jaunting forever somewhere out there in the ozone. Michaelson's lawyer, after Michaelson had been held sane and able to stand trial for what he had done (within the narrow limits of the law, perhaps he was sane, but in any practical sense, Lester Michaelson was just as mad as a hatter), had ciphered a novel defense: his client could not be tried for murder because no one could prove conclusively that Mrs. Michaelson was dead. This had raised the terrible specter of the woman, discorporeal but somehow still sentient, screaming in limbo . . . forever.",

Ford also says that he went mad for a bit and spent several months thinking he was a lemon and jumping in and out of a lake that thought it was a gin & tonic (at least he thinks it thought it was a gin & tonic... he may have been imagining it). Then he got bored with that, went sane, and tried to learn to fly. \nArthur: This is you sane again, is it?
