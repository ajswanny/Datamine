    "body": "I had a askreddit post saved that was, \"What is your favorite quick joke?\" knowing someday it would come in handy. One day, my wife and I were headed somewhere and she was having a terrible day for reasons I won't go into (glad to say, it wasn't my fault!), but she was really angry and sad and on our way to our destination we encountered a really rough patch of construction.\n\nIt was one of those days where one more thing going wrong would cause her to break down and this was it. So we're stuck in construction for 2-3 minutes and it's obvious we're gonna be there for a long time. She's ready to start crying and I pull up my phone and pull up that askreddit post and without warning just start reading her jokes.\n\nShe starts busting up laughing and since they're quick jokes, I can hit her with them one after another, before she recovers from one joke I hit her with the next. 5-7 minutes of this and they finally let us through construction and she was in a much better mood.

Basically lay your hands flat over your ears, resting fingers along the curve of your skull so that your middle fingers point at each other, then put your index fingers over top of your middles, and flick them back down into their normal position so that they drum lightly on your head. Repeat 20 or 30 times, then uncover your ears.\n\nI have no idea why this works, but it was magical relief, and clears up that painful noise whenever it arises.\n\n(I don't have a link, and am on mobile, so searching for one is tricky.)",

    "body": "I got this from an /r/askreddit thread and have used some of the knowhow irl, written and originally posted by /u/livingthepunlife:\n___________________\u20ac______________\n\nI've taken most of the posts in this list and categorised them for easy reading\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\nFILE MANAGEMENT\n\n7zip: Basically WinZip, but better in almost every regard. And it's still free!\n\nNinite: Website that allows you to add/update most of these programs to a fresh PC. Obviously not a program, but useful given this thread's content.\n\nPatch My PC: Pretty much the same as Ninite, will install most programs from this list.\n\nRecuva: File recovery tool. The perfect thing for when you accidentally delete your report 2 hours before it's due.\n\nFILE BROWSING\n\nClover: allows tabs in your file explorer. (like the tabs in Chrome, but in file explorer instead)\n\nQTTabbar: I have been informed that Clover is unstable on Win10 and can trigger antivirus software. This is the recommended alternative.\n\nXYplorer Free: Another File Explorer upgrade tool. Adds a bunch of cool features.\n\nAgent Ransack: Freeware with very powerful search tools (filtering, boolean expressions, etc) and a paid upgrade to FileLocator Pro.\n\nListary: Alternative to Everything for file searching. Very powerful and free.\n\nEverything: Instant computer searching. Much better than the default Windows search.\n\nThe Three Commanders: Reddit comment to take you to one of three \"Commander\" programs. Each program is an upgrade to the File Explorer software for Win/OSX/Linux. Bunch more features and shit.\n\nFree Commander: Like Total Commander but with more features.\n\nWEB BROWSING\n\nUBlock Origin: Available in your browser's extension store. Free, of course. It's pretty much AdBlock, but does a whole lot more. Make sure you get Origin, though.\n\nRES: Reddit Enhancement Suite. If you're using Reddit without this, you're really missing out. It adds a shitton of features and it'll ruin vanilla Reddit for you.\n\nPeerBlock: Free software to block connections coming to/from your computer.\n\nNoScript: Addon for Mozilla browsers (Firefox) that blocks scripts (like JS) from running on non-whitelisted sites. Kinda like Adblock, but for scripts.\n\nProxMate: German add-on/extension to access geoblocked content (like YouTube), is pay to use.\n\nANTIVIRUS\n\nBitdefender: Helps you to not get viruses.\n\nMalwarebytes: Helps you to get rid of the viruses that BD missed. There is a paid version, but the free ver is pretty good.\n\nHitman Pro: An antivirus software with a whole host of awesome features and a 30 day free trial. The three year license only costs $50US and it's a product from SOPHOS, so you know it's good shit.\n\nMUSIC/VIDEO\n\nMusicbee: Like iTunes, but you know, better. Because it's not iTunes.\n\nVLC: Free media player, works pretty well. Some people like it, others don't.\n\nMedia Player Classic - Home Cinema: For those who don't like VLC. I run it with the K-lite codec pack and it is amazing.\n\nFoobar2000: Free audio player for Windows, supports a wide range of audio formats and has a lot of cool features.~~~~\n\nKMPlayer: Free multimedia player, stock version is better than stock MPC-HC, would recommend.\n\nAudacity: Audio recording software, I used it for a little bit and there's so much cool shit you can do with it! Definitely recommend it. Also, it's free!\n\nExact Audio Copy: Transfer files from your CDs to your PC in almost every format. Comes with some pretty nifty features too!\n\nKodi: Free and Open Source home theatre software.\n\nGAMES\n\nUnity: Free game engine. Easy-ish to pick up and use with a shitton of tutorials.\n\nUnreal Engine: Another free game engine. Lots of documentation and easier to pick up, but you pay 5% royalties to Unreal when you make money from UE-based games.\n\nSteam: Largest online video game retailer. Desktop app allows you to organise your library of games and play them at any time. But you already knew that.\n\nOrigin: Like Steam, but for Satan EA.\n\nGOG Galaxy: Again, similar to Steam. Owned by GOG.com (formerly Good Old Games), GOG-G is a store that is was almost entirely dedicated to the old games. They still sell the classics but also sell more modern video games. All the games are also DRM free. Owned by CD Projekt (CDP Red is the dev team behind The Witcher series)\n\nVoIP\n\nTeamspeak 3: Voice Over IP program that allows you to set up a server (most people pay a company to host for them) for people to connect to and chat on. Used by online gamers around the world.\n\nDiscord: Similar to TS3, but has a browser and phone app and is entirely free to use.\n\nMumble: Another VoIP program like TS3 with purchasable servers. Haven't used it but have heard good things about it.\n\nVentrilo: Free and lightweight VoIP program, looks pretty good.\n\nART\n\nGimp: Free photoshop (Not as powerful as photoshop, but still very useful)\n\nPaint.NET: More powerful version of MSPaint\n\nInkscape: Free vector-based graphic design software. I haven't used it, but I have heard a lot of good things about it!\n\nBlender: Free, open source 3D modelling software. It's got a lot of cool features but is a tad hard to first get into.\n\nKrita: Free drawing software with a bunch of cool features.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\nThe list is now officially too long for a single post. See part two here\n___________________________\n\nEdit, apparently the links don't follow with a copy paste so here is a link to the thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/4g5sl1/z/d2f3gde\n\n      ",

    "body": "Here's the one with all the links and format:  \n***\n\n*I've taken most of the posts in this list and categorised them for easy reading*\n\n***\n\n#FILE MANAGEMENT\n\n[7zip](http://www.7-zip.org/download.html): Basically WinZip, but better in almost every regard. And it's still free!\n\n[Ninite](https://ninite.com/): Website that allows you to add/update most of these programs to a fresh PC. Obviously not a program, but useful given this thread's content.\n\n[Patch My PC](https://patchmypc.net/download): Pretty much the same as Ninite, will install most programs from this list.\n\n[Recuva](http://www.piriform.com/recuva): File recovery tool. The perfect thing for when you accidentally delete your report 2 hours before it's due.\n\n#FILE BROWSING\n\n~~[Clover](http://ejie.me/): allows tabs in your file explorer. (like the tabs in Chrome, but in file explorer instead)~~\n\n[QTTabbar](http://qttabbar.wikidot.com/): I have been informed that Clover is unstable on Win10 and can trigger antivirus software. This is the recommended alternative.\n\n[XYplorer Free](http://www.xyplorer.com/free.php): Another File Explorer upgrade tool. Adds a bunch of cool features.\n\n[Agent Ransack](https://www.mythicsoft.com/agentransack): Freeware with very powerful search tools (filtering, boolean expressions, etc) and a paid upgrade to FileLocator Pro.\n\n[Listary](http://www.listary.com/): Alternative to Everything for file searching. Very powerful and free.\n\n[Everything](http://www.voidtools.com/): Instant computer searching. Much better than the default Windows search.\n\n[The Three Commanders](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/4g5sl1/what_application_do_you_always_install_on_your/d2f6iiy): Reddit comment to take you to one of three \"Commander\" programs. Each program is an upgrade to the File Explorer software for Win/OSX/Linux. Bunch more features and shit.\n\n[Free Commander](http://freecommander.com/en/summary/): Like Total Commander but with more features.\n\n#WEB BROWSING\n\n[UBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock#installation): Available in your browser's extension store. Free, of course. It's pretty much AdBlock, but does a whole lot more. Make sure you get Origin, though.\n\n[RES](http://redditenhancementsuite.com/): Reddit Enhancement Suite. If you're using Reddit without this, you're really missing out. It adds a shitton of features and it'll ruin vanilla Reddit for you.\n\n[PeerBlock](http://www.peerblock.com/): Free software to block connections coming to/from your computer.\n\nNoScript: Addon for Mozilla browsers (Firefox) that blocks scripts (like JS) from running on non-whitelisted sites. Kinda like Adblock, but for scripts.\n\n[ProxMate](https://github.com/dvcrn/proxmate-chrome): German add-on/extension to access geoblocked content (like YouTube), is pay to use.\n\n#ANTIVIRUS\n\n[Bitdefender](http://www.bitdefender.com/): Helps you to not get viruses.\n\n[Malwarebytes](https://www.malwarebytes.org/): Helps you to get rid of the viruses that BD missed. There is a paid version, but the free ver is pretty good.\n\n[Hitman Pro](http://www.surfright.nl/en/hitmanpro): An antivirus software with a whole host of awesome features and a 30 day free trial. The three year license only costs $50US and it's a product from SOPHOS, so you know it's good shit.\n\n#MUSIC/VIDEO\n\n[Musicbee](http://getmusicbee.com/): Like iTunes, but you know, better. Because it's not iTunes.\n\n[VLC](http://www.videolan.org/vlc/download-windows.html): Free media player, works pretty well. Some people like it, others don't.\n\n[Media Player Classic - Home Cinema](https://mpc-hc.org/): For those who don't like VLC. I run it with the [K-lite codec pack](http://www.codecguide.com/download_kl.htm) and it is amazing.\n\n[Foobar2000](http://www.foobar2000.org/): Free audio player for Windows, supports a wide range of audio formats and has a lot of cool features.~~~~\n\n[KMPlayer](http://www.kmplayer.com/): Free multimedia player, stock version is better than stock MPC-HC, would recommend.\n\n[Audacity](http://www.audacityteam.org/): Audio recording software, I used it for a little bit and there's so much cool shit you can do with it! Definitely recommend it. Also, it's free!\n\n[Exact Audio Copy](http://www.exactaudiocopy.de/): Transfer files from your CDs to your PC in almost every format. Comes with some pretty nifty [features](http://www.exactaudiocopy.de/en/index.php/overview/features/features-of-eac/) too!\n\n[Kodi](https://kodi.tv/): Free and Open Source home theatre software.\n\n#GAMES\n\n[Unity](https://unity3d.com/): Free game engine. Easy-ish to pick up and use with a shitton of tutorials.\n\n[Unreal Engine](https://www.unrealengine.com/what-is-unreal-engine-4): Another free game engine. Lots of documentation and easier to pick up, but you pay 5% royalties to Unreal when you make money from UE-based games.\n\n[Steam](http://store.steampowered.com/): Largest online video game retailer. Desktop app allows you to organise your library of games and play them at any time. But you already knew that.\n\n[Origin](https://www.origin.com/en-au/store/): Like Steam, but for ~~Satan~~ EA.\n\n[GOG Galaxy](https://www.gog.com/galaxy): Again, similar to Steam. Owned by GOG.com (formerly Good Old Games), GOG-G is a store that ~~is~~ was almost entirely dedicated to the old games. They still sell the classics but also sell more modern video games. All the games are also DRM free. Owned by CD Projekt (CDP Red is the dev team behind The Witcher series)\n\n#VoIP\n\n[Teamspeak 3](https://www.teamspeak.com/teamspeak3): Voice Over IP program that allows you to set up a server (most people pay a company to host for them) for people to connect to and chat on. Used by online gamers around the world.\n\n[Discord](https://discordapp.com/): Similar to TS3, but has a browser and phone app and is entirely free to use.\n\n[Mumble](http://www.mumble.com/): Another VoIP program like TS3 with purchasable servers. Haven't used it but have heard good things about it.\n\n[Ventrilo](http://www.ventrilo.com/): Free and lightweight VoIP program, looks pretty good.\n\n#ART\n\n[Gimp](https://www.gimp.org/): Free photoshop (Not as powerful as photoshop, but still very useful)\n\n[Paint.NET](http://www.getpaint.net/index.html): More powerful version of MSPaint\n\n[Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/en/): Free vector-based graphic design software. I haven't used it, but I have heard a lot of good things about it!\n\n[Blender](https://www.blender.org/): Free, open source 3D modelling software. It's got a lot of cool features but is a tad hard to first get into.\n\n[Krita](https://krita.org/): Free drawing software with a bunch of cool features.\n\n***\n\n*The list is now officially too long for a single post.
