Before he was brought to the electric chair, he was offered any last meal he desired so long as its acquisition did not harm another person. The man, we'll call him Ted, requested a rare blue apple from the depths of the Nainital jungle. After many days of searching, it was procured, and Ted ate his last meal. He was strapped to the chair shortly after, and thousands of volts were pumped through his body. However, to the great surprise of every witness, Ted was perfectly fine. Due to the inability to carry out the sentence, Ted was set free.\n\nShortly after Ted was released from prison, he managed to secure a job piloting a trolley for tourists. Weeks after he was hired, Ted was involved in yet another terrible accident, once again resulting in great loss of life. Once again he was sentenced to die by the electric chair, and once again he requested a rare blue apple from the depths of the Nainital jungle. When Ted's execution arrived, the spectators and workers involved were for the second time shocked when Ted stood from the chair unharmed, his sentence once again unable to be carried out. \n\nKnowing he could never transport people again, Ted turned to alternative career paths, eventually becoming the maestro of a small, local orchestra. However, as was Ted's luck, the entire orchestra save Ted was killed in a tragic fire, and Ted was blamed. For the third time he was sentenced to die, for the third time he requested a blue apple from the depths of the Nainital jungle, but suspecting foul play, for the first time in history, his last meal request was denied by the warden. Ted sat in the chair, the switch was flipped, and Ted showed no signs of discomfort, much to the further dismay of everyone. The officers unstrapped Ted from the chair for a third time, and one, unable to live with his curiosity, grabbed Ted by the shoulder.\n\n\"We all thought it was the blue apples that were keeping you from being electrocuted, please, I have to know, why haven't you died?\"\n\n\"Well...\"\n\nTed said sheepishly\n\n\"I guess I'm just a bad conductor\"",

It booms \"You have finally freed me after all these years, so I'll grant each one of you 3 wishes.\" The first guy immediately blurts out \"I want a billion dollars.\" POOF, he's holding a printout that shows his account balance is now in fact 1,000,000,003.50 The second man thinks for a bit, then says \"I want to be the richest man alive.\" POOF, he's holding papers showing his net worth is now well over 100 billion. The third guy thinks even longer about his wish, then says \"I want my left arm to rotate clockwise for the rest of my life.\" POOF, his arm starts rotating. The Genie tells them it's time for their second wish. The first guy says: \"I want to be married to the most beautiful woman on earth.\" POOF, a stunning beauty wraps herself around his arm. The second guy says \"I want to be good-looking and charismatic, so I can have every girl I want.\" POOF, his looks change and the first guy's wife immediately starts flirting with him. The third guy says \"I want my right arm to rotate counter-clockwise until I die.\" POOF, now both his arms are rotating, in opposite directions. The genie tells them to think very carefully about their third wish. The first guy does, and after a while says \"I never want to become sick or injured, I want to stay healthy until I die.\" POOF, his complexion improves, his acne is gone and his knees don't bother him anymore. The second guy says \"I never want to grow old. I want to stay 29 forever.\" POOF, he looks younger already. The third guy smiles triumphantly and says \"My last wish is for my head to nod back and forth.\" POOF, he's now nodding his head and still flailing his arms around. The genie wishes them good luck, disappears, and the men soon go their separate ways. Many years later they meet again and chat about how things have been going. The first guy is ecstatic: \"I've invested the money and multiplied it many times over, so me and my family will be among the richest of the rich pretty much forever. My wife is a freak in the sheets, and I've never gotten so much as a cold in all these years.\" The second guy smiles and says \"Well, I built charities worldwide with a fraction of my wealth, I'm still the richest guy alive and also revered for my good deeds. I haven't aged a day since we last met, and yes, your wife is pretty wild in bed.\" The third guy walks in, flailing his arms around and nodding his head, and says: \"Guys, I think I fucked up.\"\n\nEdit: thank you kind Redditors for the gold!!

Finally one day Justin said to Christian, \"I'm fed up with being a prawn, I wish I were a shark, then I wouldn't have any worries about being eaten.\"\n\nThen a large mysterious cod appeared and said, \"Your wish is granted\" - and, lo and behold, Justin turned into a shark.\n\nHorrified, Christian immediately swam away, afraid of being eaten by his old sea mate. Time passed (as it invariably does) and Justin found life as a shark boring and lonely.\n\n\nAll his old mates simply swam away whenever he came close to them. Justin didn't realize that his new menacing appearance was the cause of his sad plight.\n\nWhile swimming alone one day he saw the mysterious cod again and he thought perhaps the mysterious fish could change him back into a prawn.\n\nHe approached the cod and begged to be changed back, and lo and behold, he found himself turned back into a prawn.\n\nWith tears of joy in his tiny little eyes Justin swam back to his friends and bought them all a cocktail. Looking around the gathering at the reef he realized he couldn't see his old pal. \"Where's Christian?\" he asked.\n\n\n\"He's at home, still distraught that his best friend changed sides to the enemy and became a shark\", came the reply.\n\nEager to put things right again and end the mutual pain and torture, he set off to Christian's abode. As he opened the coral gate memories came flooding back. He banged on the door and shouted, \"It's me, Justin, your old friend, come out and see me again.\"\n\nChristian replied,\"No way man, you'll eat me. You're now a shark, the enemy, and I'll not be tricked into being your dinner.\"\n\nJustin cried back \"No, I'm not. That was the old me. I've changed.... I've found Cod. I'm a Prawn again, Christian.\"  \n\nEdit: joke.",

I picked it up and dusted it off a little -- when all of a sudden this enormous genie pops out! \n\n\"The genie thundered, 'You have released me from my ten-thousand year imprisonment, and I am in your debt.

And all of a sudden I have rings on my fingers and a crown on my head, and my wallet is full of money and a dozen ATM cards and the deed to a mansion in the hills -- I mean, I was loaded! \n\n\"So I said, 'Amazing! Okay, for my next wish , I want to be married to the most beautiful woman in the world.' \n\n\"The genie says, 'Your wish is granted.' And the ocean parts, and out walks this gorgeous woman in this beautiful dress, and she takes my hand and we fall in love and the genie marries us right there. It was incredible. \n\n\"The genie booms, 'You have one wish remaining.'\" \n\nThe man with the big orange head pauses and sips his beer. He says, \"Now, you know, this may be where I went wrong.

Chicken watches the music video and says \"hey, that drum part is pretty cool, I want to learn to play that.\"\nChicken goes to the phone book, looks up a music teacher and calls him. \"Hi, I'd like to learn to play the drums.\" Says the chicken.\n\"Sure,\" says the man on the phone. \"Just come to your lesson and we'll get you started.\"\n\"There's just one problem,\" says the chicken. \"I'm a chicken.\"\n\"Not to worry,\" the man says. \"We have new state of the art technology to teach chickens.

Cow thinks it's pretty cool, and wants to learn how to play the bass guitar.\nCow goes to the phone book, looks up a music teacher and calls him. \"Hi, I'd like to learn to play bass guitar.\" Says the cow.\n\"Sure,\" says the man on the phone. \"Just come to your lesson and we'll get you started.\"\n\"There's just one problem,\" says the cow. \"I'm a cow.\"\n\"Not to worry,\" the man says. \"We have new state of the art technology to teach cows.

They go on a worldwide tour and make tons of money. Right before the last show of the tour, which is supposed to be in Vegas, Horse gets a call. His mother is in hospital.\nHorse goes to visit her before the show while the rest of the band goes to Vegas to set up. It turns out that she's all good, it's just a cold. As horse is leaving the hospital, he gets another call. The private jet that was carrying the band and their producer crashed into the ocean, and there were no survivors.\nHorse is devastated. All of his best friends are dead, he's out of a job and he's stuck with nowhere to go. He breaks down in tears and decides he'll drink himself to death.\nSo the horse walks into a bar.\nThe bartender asks, \"why the long face?\"",

Here\u2019s my favourite:\n\nOnce upon a time, there were three kingdoms that all surrounded a beautiful, fertile plot of land that none of them have yet claimed. All three kingdoms wanted this land, and so they decided that they\u2019d send their best warriors to fight a war over the land, and the winner would get to claim it.\n\nThe first kingdom was a very rich kingdom, and was able to send it\u2019s 20 best warriors, each with their own 2 squires. While the squires polished the shining armours and sharpened the magnificent blades of their masters using specially made equipment by the greatest engineers in the kingdom, the warriors trained hard and drunk the finest ales to lift their spirits.\n\nThe second kingdom was not as big and prosperous as the first kingdom, but was still able to send 10 warriors, each with their own squire. Their armour and weaponry was nowhere near as fancy as the first kingdom, but what they lacked in riches they made up for in combat prowess. The squires used military grade polishes and grindstones to prepare the warriors weaponry and armour while they themselves prepared for combat, drinking cheap ale to put a spring in their step. \n\nThe last kingdom was quite poor, and was mostly allowed to participate in this fight due to being pitied by the other kingdoms. They send 1 warrior, an elderly man, along with his lone squire. The squire and his master did not have fine equipment, the squire had to use a noose to hang a kettle above the fire so he could boil water (boiling water was the best armour polish they could afford). The elderly warrior trained, while the squire tried his best to make his equipment suitable for battle.\n\nThe dawn of the next day, when the battle was scheduled, the warriors from the first two kingdoms have drank too much ale the previous day and could not fight. As well, the single Elderly knight would not wake up from his sleep. This meant that all the squires were left to fight over the land. None of them had ever fought before but they were left with no choice. Donning their masters armour and weapons, they charged into battle and commenced a quite clumsy, awkward battle in which there were many deaths. When the battle ended, only one squire remained: the lone, single squire of the third kingdom! With his victory at hand, the third kingdom took their plot of land and soon prospered to greatness. \n\nThis just goes to show, the squire of the high pot and noose is equal to the sum of the squires of the remaining sides.",

The most common cause for wizards to reluctantly summon Death is to ask him questions about inexplicable phenomena, because he seems to know everything. The Rite needs to be performed by eight powerful wizards, either with loads of magical paraphernalia for the look of the thing, or with only a few small bits of essential equipment. Death doesn't like the Rite of AshkEnte, because it so happens that he's always busy when the wizards summon him. Powerful (read: old) wizards dislike the ritual as it makes Death more aware of them, period. \n\nthink douglas adams and monty python writing a tolkien movie.",
