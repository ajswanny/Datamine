I then get in my car and rev my engine up for about a minute to \"warm up the engine because my car has a turbo on it and a youtube video said I should because reasons\" and also because at about 3000rpms my aftermarket exhaust resonates in just this certain way that I like. Since I live in an apartment complex, I park facing someone else's bedroom window, so I make sure that my headlights are on, because I like the way their curtains look in my HID headlights. They are the curtains with holes in them that dont block out much light, so I'm sure they enjoy the way their room becomes illuminated with a pattern. Then, since i drive a stick, I try to shift into reverse, gun it to chirp my tires (helps them warm up), forget about reverse lockout so I'm actually in first, drive forward as fast as possible on accident, and crash into my neighbors bedroom. Then I get out because I forgot to grab the coffee cup I put on top of my car, back up, and go to my job at Comcast Customer Service.\n\nI must point out, though, this story is implausible because that's not how reverse lockout in a manual transmission works. :P\n\nSource: I have a manual transmission car.",

I think it's because I'd never make something up, so I don't immediately imagine someone else would.\n\nI was reading an old thread on here about plane accidents recently. Someone posted a quite long, detailed, very believable story about being on a plane when something happened that punctured the wing. I read it open mouthed, and he sounded like a decent chap, giving interesting details about how he felt, not making it too melodramatic. Then under all the comments saying 'omg how awful you poor thing'' etc, he basically said 'haha you stupid assholes for believing that, this is the internet anyone can make up any dumbshit and here you are believing it.' No idea what he got out of that but I just thought... fuck you. The vast majority of people aren't weird sociopathic liars, so I will continue to read interesting stories and assume they're true. I'm not believing that cabbage soup cures cancer or that the man really has sweets and puppies in his van. I would lose out more by being super sceptical about every single cool story I read than I would by being wide eyed and credulous and getting taken in by a lie  every so often. ",
