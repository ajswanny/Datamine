I could restock the machine for $90 and I never took less than $300 out of it when I emptied the cash.

Locate the proper tool to tighten this and you will make the claw stay tight when it closes. Many claw machines have this as loose as possible so even if you initially grab a prize it will not stay in the claws grasp. Tighter tension insures a firm grasp and an easier time \"winning\" ",

    "body": "As someone that used to work in casino I have to agree. Also most gamblers were mentally ill or very bored old men that had nothing better to do with their time. I have some casino worker horror stories, but there isn't the place for them. \n\nEDIT: I return with a very late edit because some people are waiting for some stories. First I worked both in a casino and an agency for sport gambling. At casino there weren't many incidents to tell in particular, except for their stupid rule that the attendants should stand up as long there are customers and be ready every second to pay their cash outs or serve them with drinks. Guess what? Most of the shifts we had to stand up for 12 hours straight with a fake professional smile on our faces while enduring every angry cretin frustrated with their stupidity. At the end of the day, I barely felt my lags while my feet were turned purple with very inflated veins. This may not sound very impressive but trust me, you don't want to live that.\n\nI moved from that casino to a sport gamble agency (I really have no idea for the correct term in English) because you sit down and people are cumming and leave. Wrong! First of all, on the next floor there was a restaurant and because something went wrong somewhere, there was always a very strange smell  inside. People from the casino were okayish compared with the creatures I meet there. I had no idea that the area the agency was placed was populated with the biggest creeps I'll ever meet in my life. Have you ever seen a group monkeys obsessed with a number? Those monkeys were very obsessed with 7. I swear if ever again I'll the equivalent in my language  for \"5 of 7\" I'm going to punch someone in the mouth. There was a creature that shown low signs of intelligence. It was around 35 and still living with it's mother and had no job. Most of the time it was there inside the agency, every time he saw a any line on the screen of the slot he will get very excited, starting to congratulate very loudly the \"winner\". It was annoying for everyone. Every time it played it will always lose and get very pissed and start to swear and yell and do like a baboon inside a heated oven. It will always put the phone on speaker and talk very loudly with its mother that called him often. It is beyond redemption.\n\nOther specimens were two brothers. A bit more supportable that the Dumbfuck mentioned earlier, but they will get very pissed for losing at slots and cry like animals. There where also few others doing the same and the worse part was that the manager had no interest to ban any of them for their behavior because they broke no rule she said. The medium was very toxic and tiresome because of them having all day around inside making the sport betting part even harder.\n\nTime to get to the sport gamble part. There were two old men coming every day to make kilometric tickets on sports on the lowest bet possible. I have no idea if they were hopping to guess the results on a shitton of matches and get rich by betting a very small amount of money, or they were just bored hell spawns that were there to make the day even worse. Sometimes the stupid software will crash for having to process too many matches and I'll have to write their tickets manually again, creating a long beyond them and pissing the Hell Lady I'll talk about next.\n\nThere was this other thing from the deeps of hell looking like an old lady. It will be there from the moment the agency open and will leave at the end. It is very obsessed with Kino (some shitty kind of lottery with extractions every 5 minutes). It will put a lot of tickets for every tour, resulting in me creating more tickets that was humanly possible, sometimes without any break for the entire day. The only time when I wasn't placing tickets for her was when there were other customers waiting in line. The worse is that it wasn't alone, sometimes there was another like it.\n\nIn the contract my shift was for 12h, but I had to be there half hour earlier for the opening and leave much later because I had to register every won ticket. Because of Hell Lady I had to register hundreds of them, meaning I had to squeeze together the winning tickets with the matching receipt of them. Usually you do this after you validate a winning ticket, but because I was doing countless of them I had no time for it so I had to remain like two extra hours over time to do this and other stuff.\n\nIf the fact my last job itself fucked me in the head so hard because the customers and the very toxic medium doesn't make it sound very scary well is time for the end of the story. After two months I decided to say \"fuck it\" and quit. I had one more week there and an accident happened because I was very tired already and I gave someone the winning with an extra 0, resulting in a very big sum. Oh well, if they were humans they will understand and let me repay the loss in installments during a period of time, but they demanded all the money back in few days. Next day they started to accuse me of fraud because they saw me on camera \"how I put a ticket for myself\" and that's illegal. After I contested that, they accused me of actually being the accomplice of that gambler and it was our plan all along to steal from them, thus being the reason why I was to ken to quit faster from that place. \n\nTwo months of stress followed up trying to solve this mess. I started to feel into a crippling depression and anxiety. On first days I hopped to be hit by a car or get killed by a maniac in the middle of the street and end this shit up. Then I was starting to think at the most efficient suicide method. In the end maybe they realized they fucked up and withdraw any reclamation against me because they left me alone. After this period of stress I was left with some trauma but I had no power to sue them and fail because my shitty country is very corrupt and a well placed bribe will fuck you up forever and my mental state was decaying really badly and another process will make it worse.\n\nI'm better now, even that I'm very anxious to get a new job and I really need one. I had to drop Uni in my last year because I wasn't able to continue it. My relationship with my parents was affected a lot because they are believing their story.\n\nExcuse me for any grammar mistake, typo or whatever, but it was a long day and I'm too tired to double check it. Now I need to play some ESO and recharge my happiness. Cya!   \n",

The water to be transformed is placed into a confined vessel such as a cylindrical container or a pipe inside the central cavity for about sixty seconds.

It gradually became the \"style of artists\" in New York, and gained a widespread appeal in the late 00s, before becoming mass-produced in the 10s. \n\nIt's an interesting style, historically, because it doesn't come from the rich, like traditional or modern decorating styles. Industrial chic comes from an era and place of poverty, was adopted by the rich, and then returned to the general public in the midst of a recession, due to its affordable nature. Now we're seeing it return to the rich again, but anyone can still go down to Home Depot and toss together some decent furniture in an afternoon. \n\n\n\n",

The aggressive sales tactics go all the way to the top of the organization. I have seen Market Managers come in to the store and print out reports on customers who haven't missed a payment in a month and instruct us to sell to them. Most of these customers can't afford what they have on rent already and they were still forcing us to aggressively add more items to their accounts. \n\nThen there is the \"charitable\" rewrite of the rental contract. Basically a customer can't afford to make the payment, or is already late and dodging the calls, and so the store would rewrite the contract and give them a new due date, adding plenty of more weeks to the original term. This was done in such away to seem sympathetic but in reality the account manager didn't want to lose the account, didn't want to have to physically go  repossess the item(s) (either due to laziness or because often these homes could be pretty filthy) and still wanted to clear the past due off of his sheet. \n\nAnd the actual repossessing, OMFG. Stalking, harassment, threats, breaking and entering (like picking locks, kicking doors in and climbing through windows, tricking children). We called the police. We lied. We showed up on Christmas Eve and took everything! Bunk beds, TVs, refrigerators. Again I saw this behavior from upper management all the way down to the account managers. \n\nI saw employees trade sex and drugs to not repo items. \n\nAnd yeah you could go in before the big game and rent some TVs for the weekend but they know what you want it for and will charge you more for it. It is a good deal compared to buying a new tv considering they will deliver it, set it up and pick it up for you. But remember when I said earlier that some of the customers homes could be pretty filthy? Well we are talking bed begs, cockroaches, rodents, animal feces, bodily fluids you name it. Often there is little time to  thoroughly disinfect the items. To this day I won't eat at a restaurant that is in the same plaza as a rent to own store. \n\nAs far as the 90 days same as cash goes, you are forbidden from selling an item for less than 350% of what the item cost the store. Rent A Center buys a lot of products from big companies so they get it pretty cheap, but the store pays a mark up. And the target price for 90 days same as cash is still more like 500% of what the store paid. \n\nThen there is the quality of the items. The Ashley Durapella Sage sofa set that you get from Rent A Center is not the same quality as the one you get from the Ashley store. I never made it far enough into the company to find out the whole deal but I did use my employee discount to buy that exact couch set brand new. When it broke 2 years later and I was no longer with RAC I decided to go get the exact same couch from the Ashley store. The one from Ashley was AMAZING. So comfortable and soft and so far it's lasted really well. \n\nBasically Rent A Center and all those rent to own places are deplorable bottom feeding predators. So fuck them. ",
