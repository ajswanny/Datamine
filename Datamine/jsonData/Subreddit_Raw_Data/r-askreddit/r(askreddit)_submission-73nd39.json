Call them enemies of the people. \n\n3) Offer a 3-1 reduction in Military manpower with South Korea. Leave my artillery zeroed in on Seoul to guard against perfidy on the Wests part. \n\n4) Open up the Borders to specific peoples from outside: Agricultural specialists, modern industrial planners and send those demobilized soldiers to them for training. In lieu of a requirement for military service I'd allow high schoolers to go there as well. \n\n5) Launch a biannual best invention expo wherein the winners would get a contract to develop it. Those demobilized soldiers and high school grads would deploy to those for development. \n\n6) Open more Private-Public Partnerships wherein the workers would slowly gain up to 49% of companies. Production shifts slowly by 5-10 percent every year from state planning to local conditions. \n\n7) Set up a tipline for corruptor's of the Juche spirit and use it to take out those that were taking advantage/might be a problem to my aims.  \n\n8) At this point, there is most likely some unknown issue that I'd respond to with outside investment and the deployment of top 10 percent of graduates to European and other legit universities. We'd lose a few but that's okay. \n\n9) Trim the state budget as industries need less state controls. Transfer those costs to achieve a more modernized but smaller military (keep them happy) and remaining monies invested in more development. Make it a requirement to do so every 5 years. Talk it up to get citizen buy-in. \n\n10) By this point I've gotten a growing economic sector outside of the military, I've shrank the military ( yet bought them off with a better trained force and got rid of fossils), allowed for more holistic state health. I then hold a press conference and announce I've discovered something horrific- the camp system. This allows me to get rid of those remaining resistors to the new order as I blame my advisors for keeping me in the dark and their complicity in this. \n\n11) Go underground for a period and then unleash my first song- something in memory of those imprisoned in the Camps and call for a period of national mourning. \n\n12) Now I'm seen as an economic modernizer, bringer of peace and a protector of the nation. As a god and a national icon- my record almost sells itself.  \n",

(Generals, Advisors, and The Royal Family in this case), and if you don't keep your relations well your \"keys\", which are essential to executing your orders will begin allying with someone who wishes to give them more privileges, and if the majority of your \"keys\" ally with them, a coup happens and you get overthrown. \n\nOkay, first I dismantle the missiles in exchange for more trade with China/Russia/US/etc. and lifting of the tariffs on North Korea, and get my propaganda machine to pass it off as the glorious leader being a great diplomat, and getting rid of something that was starving the North Koreans. Then start re-establishing ties with China, because they are my main ally, this won't piss off my keys, and it will get me the supplies to start feeding my people again.\n\nStart advertising myself as the savior of the people if Kim Jong Un's regime hasn't already. Begin hanging out with the locals of Pyongyang and start looking like a leader of the people. After that begin making ties with Russia, becoming a second ally and getting even more food. Warming relations with the US or the West at this point is a suicidal move here, since the people, who have been brainwashed will see it as a betrayal and a coup will almost certainly happen. Begin importing modern tech and form a Eastern \"Anti-West/USA\" Alliance with Russia and China. \n\nAt this point, North Korea is already much more prosperous, it isn't as prosperous as South Korea and will start to look a lot like China, but it will definitely be semi prosperous, begin exporting coal, iron and whatnot to the allies (Russia and China.) Slowly warm the people's opinion on the US, but don't make it friendly. North Korea now has food, water and basic hygiene, and will begin modernizing.\n\nStart a farming initiative to re-juvenile the North Korean soil (I have no idea how this works...) to make North Korea independent of imports. Open up (still highly guarded and restricted) borders with China and Russia, but make it really expensive so the normal people can't get out. To prevent a mass exodus of rich North Koreans (by traveling to China then to US etc.), give the richer people a way to bribe officials out of arrest, and be above the law, in other words they now have nice privileges which they don't want to give up. Transition to state socialism (where companies are allowed but controlled by the state), then start a bunch of programs to modernize North Korea. I don't want to give them free speech or the internet (yet) because I don't want to risk a coup. Now I have a son (or daughter) and the second they turn 15/18 I give them leadership, show them around, then flee to China to start my singing career.",

This \"SSP\" would have to include influential members of the party, industrial complex, and military. Buy their continued loyalty with pledges of great wealth in the new Korea, and use these promises to gain more influential members in the SSP until the SSP is in de facto control of all sectors of life. \n\nFollowing that, it is necessary to begin an immediate purge of pro-chinese, the most devout communists, supporters of your father, and other reactionaries. This way, you can begin filling in government roles with people from across the country, branding the action as a \"People's Governmental Overhaul for the Efficiency of the State\".\n\nWith your new government in solid power, you can begin to offer inroads to *the SOUTH KOREAN GOVERNMENT*. By making connections with the government of President Moon Jae-In, a noted liberal and pro-unification activist, you can secure favorable guarantees for your security and the security of your SSP.  A covert period would be necessary for the agreement on the basic tenets of unification (Federal Republic of Korea, Capital Seoul, President Moon, Unicameral National Assembly, etc). In essence, this transition would be the creation of a road plan for the merging of the North Korean states into the South Korean governmental structure. Another important point to agree upon is a long-term plan for the South Korean investment into the North so that infrastructure, industry can be built. \n\nOnce a plan is agreed upon by both you(and by extension your SSP) and the Moon Jae-In government, a public announcement can be made in some spectacular fashion, perhaps with a Kim visit to Seoul to meet Moon and see historical/cultural sites. By announcing the unification in such a public and surprising way, you can ensure global headlines for a week, which is plenty of time to announce your creation of a new global pop sensation- *\"Earth, Wind, and Fire (and Kim)\"*",

    "body": "Thank you for actually answering the question, this is the best answer I've seen so far. You've demonstrated a good understanding of the problem by pointing out that you'd have to get rid of the oldest and most stubborn status-quo officials, which are found in all governments, and will always fight any significant changes.\n\n* How would you deal with a 25mil population all on the brink of starvation? And the inevitable mass refugee crisis? China and South Korea are very cold-hearted about this and are very much against the idea of taking in tons of refugees. As soon as you loosen up the borders, you're gonna cause a massive flood and you're gonna get a lot of push-back from your 2 neighbors, especially China, who will cut your aid. You say you would lose a few, but in reality you would lose nearly every single one you allow to visit abroad. Better to just use the internet to educate internally, and that way you also retain control.\n\n* An invention expo does nothing for a starving populace with no resources. Better to fund small businesses with seed money as you slowly open up the economy to capitalism. I would sell mining rights to the Chinese for 20-30 years with a % of the profits and then I would institute a universal basic income. Heavily invest in infrastructure.\n\n* I would borrow as much money as possible, completely disregarding any debt taken on. I would use that money to increase funding for free universal healthcare, infrastructure, overall modernization of just about everything. And then I would invest heavily in nuclear energy, using the country's existing nuclear weapons program to get ahead start. If executed correctly, you could jump-start the entire economy with ultra-cheap, abundant, clean energy.\n\nNo matter what, this would take a lifetime to implement, and even then you'd have to retire early and monitor the transition to a democracy to ensure that the new constitution is strong enough to resist any insurgent despots.",

    "body": "You've brought up some really good points. I'd neglected to fully explore the food issue in my statement but I had considered it in passing. As you indicated one of the significant concerns relating to any potential conflict w/ North Korea is what happens in the aftermath.Their military is so out-of date and brittle that it legitimately can't stand against the US nor China and probably would struggle against South Korea. Their best defense, outside the inherent fear of a Kim with Nukes, is their artillery positions surrounding Seoul (a city with millions of citizens). \n\n1) I think the first thing we have to accept with North Korea is that its so brittle that radical change has a legitimate possibility of completely destroying the State. You need slow and measured change yet not so measured we have the citizens themselves kill the State (like in East Germany). \n\n2) I think before we get into economic debates and agricultural analyses we would have to examine the national budget and outlays and it probably shows a significant percentage of GDP (if not all) goes to the military. Getting that modernized, while costly in the short-term, would ultimately lower costs. \n\n* one of my thoughts- because it's happened before is that outside food aid was tied to good behavior. A 3-1 troop reduction plus economic modernization, outside the military, would have to come with significant food imports from the West. The US did it before so I'd assume they could do it again. \n\n3) So now we've got costs on the downturn with the military but we need to be cognizant of the potential for economic devastation with mass discharges from the military. That's why I thought bringing in outside trainers in agriculture and industry would be a good idea. In many ways, it could be akin to the GI Bill. \n\n* I think this is an important step, and something we're not thinking about, because they are trained in rote-memorization not in critical thinking. How do we give them enough critical thinking skills to respond to economic issues yet not so much they move against the regime. I'm not sure there is an answer but to see economic recovery I think you've got to develop that. Eventually, these trainees could be utilized to deploy up and teach the elders and then down to teach the Youth. So, we have to challenge this rigidity of thought or they won't have the ability to utilize small start-up loans, etc. \n\n3) This intellectual rigidity was why I was pushing a slow movement of economic control from the State to the populace. I think you've got to create the idea that they can be their own boss. While that is being inculcated within the populace you've got to keep things moving. As that gets embraced, you start opening things up to trial and error. People on the Coast want to try growing Sugarcane and not Corn or Peppers and not brick making. Ultimately, give them the training and then let them judge their environment. \n\n4) My thoughts on the invention expo was to further develop the sense of private economic systems and then to create jobs. I suppose there would have to be multiple 'awards' and grants but my further thoughts was that this would aid in the creation of marketable exports. (I have no idea what would grow in N. Korea which is why I'm vague on this). \n\n5) I would personally be hesitant in borrowing money. You've got (as a country) a long history of instability and I have no idea who would loan on that history. Further, you have no ability to pay it back because your main current exports are mostly centered on counterfeiting, slavery and drugs. I'm also hesitant after looking at Venezuela and their issues with unrestrained debt (among other problems). \n\nSo, to wrap all this up. You've got to balance the budget by chopping the military down to size, while still maintaining control, you've got to create the belief that workers can work independent of the State but not challenge the State. Further, you've got to get them modern machinery and you've got to develop industry that will thrive without State sponsorship. It's a massive transition but it has to be a slow and steady progression. \n\nIt's not going to be a 5 week deal. This is at best 10+ years. \n\n\n\n",

Let me elaborate. \n\n1) So, I'm first going to target the upper echelon- who I'm referring to derisively as the 'Old Fossils'. Most would envision [this] (http://i.imgur.com/M0nSFzI.png). However, I envision the term something akin to 'kulak' as utilized by the Soviet Union in the 1930's. The vagueness of the definition would allow me to cull out the upper echelon of the NKPA on a level commiserate with Stalin and the Red Army prior to WW2. Without leadership, they have no ability to move against me. \n\n2) Now, I've not messed with some units, like the Artillery units near Seoul, for a few reasons. Those artillery positions- and their ability to target Seoul are one of the reasons why we've never knocked out the Kim Family. That protects my flank as I'm securing the interior of the country. Also, for an artillery unit to be a threat they would have to move those pieces from the border towards Pyongyang- with the leadership decapitated (and their training being to avoid junior level initiative) I shouldn't have to worry. \n\n3) Now, I'm raising a new crop of officers- whose advancement and power are owed to me. I've cut troop levels, as per my 3-1 deal with the South Koreans, because I understand that I can get the same 'bang for my buck' with less men and better equipment. In that sense, I'm giving them a variation of the deal Hitler offering the German military in '33. They are getting the power of their new positions and increased funding to modernize the military and all I want is their loyalty. Of course, the spigot has to stay open to keep them bought. It will also take some time for them to rise to the competence required of their roles so I've bought myself some time. \n\n4) Now, I'm divorcing the population from the military by removing its access to the entire male population because of conscription. That does two things: it lowers enlistments and because the military is leaner it raises the standard of living for the populace meaning with a little bit of good PR that I've tied their increased standard of living to my actions. A coup against me is a coup against their increased standard of living. That lays the groundwork for a potential further block on the military. \n\nNow, I've culled the leadership, bought off the military leaders with power, prestige and a leaner stronger force and then fulled the savings over to the civilian sector to create an economic check on the military. \n\n5) I've set up 2 further checks on any unchecked challenge to my authority- at the same time furthering my own aims. \n\n* Establishing a tip-line to report abuses of the juche code is a convenient cover to dispose of any who might be a threat to my reforms. Consider it a variation of the Night of the Long Knives in Nazi Germany. \n\n* Announcing the 'discovery' of the Camps means that I can also remove any that might go against my rule as 'betrayers of the people'. This further has the benefit of destroying the legitimacy of the military (or whoever I saddle it with). It's kind of like how the Wehrmacht leadership post World War II created an artificial divide between the Nazis and the Wehrmacht. Thus, the Wehrmacht was reinvented after a time as the Bundeswehr and the legitimacy of the Nazis (and Hitler within Germany) was destroyed. \n\nUltimately, I think I've set it up wherein a cost-benefit analysis would show that they are better of with me as 'Their Leader' than with someone else. These generals would get power, prestige and wealth and the ability to practice their craft. The people see an economic and social improvement by diverting funds from the military that are unneeded, conveniently establishing a check on military action. Further, saddling military officers with the guilt of the Camps weakens the legitimacy of the military and would allow me to'reform' as necessary.  \n\n",

You gain fame as Kim Jong Un the pop star and meet up with your former self, thinking its Kim.\n\nThe person formerly you tells you that he is Albert Einstein. You don't believe him. Kim is pranking you. He insists, shows you the physics he's been working on. He's spent years toiling his way up the reincarnation ladder, thinking of physics all the while. A particular bit of inspiration on cold fusion came into his mind while he was chewing cud right before he was swapped into your body. \n\nFor eternity, your former identity will be remembered as the most famous physicist in history after Albert Einstein, having solved the problem of balancing our energy needs with the environment. Your fame as Kim Jong Un becomes a joke for third-string comedians on VH1's I Love the 2010s.\n\nWashed up from your career as a pop singer and not having had the foresight to invest your money, you spend your days drinking in your living room, wearing nothing but your underwear. A familiar face comes up on TV, but worn with age. It's clear that the last twenty years have not been kind to your old face, but you still look fit. Einstein-as-You is receiving his fifth Nobel Prize since his first with the discovery of cold fusion in 2017. He has since refocused, bringing his unique insights, garnered over many lifetimes, to problems such as longevity, hunger, and overpopulation. The first ever colony on Mars has been named after him.\n\nYou throw your bottle at the 98\" TV screen. It bounces off \u2014 in his free time, Einstein-as-You invented a new kind of ultra-tough glass \u2014 and clocks you in the head. You fall. You lie there. Your head feels warm. You can smell and taste copper as the room begins to become dark.\n\nA goat overhears its owner telling his wife. \"Huh, you know Kim Jong Un? The pop star? He died last night.\"",

The situation was at least superficially similar: Gaddafi gave up his nuclear program and sanctions were lifted. It didn't work out well for Gaddafi.\n\nDo you really think that if he had a nuclear weapon available to him that the Western powers would have been so willing to sit back and see how it played out? The risk of the first use of a nuclear weapon in warfare since Nagasaki would have spurred them into action.\n\nKim has cultivated a persona that, whether real or not, serves him well in brinkmanship. A non-rational actor can more credibly make outlandish threats and have them be believed. I think that US and NATO leaders would believe that he would nuke his own people if a rebellion backed him in to a corner. They also believe he would bomb the shit out of Seoul with the artillery he has hidden throughout the mountains. It will be hard to get him to give up that leverage (the only leverage he has).",
