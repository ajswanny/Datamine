The parents couldn't have been more discouraging to him. He was excitedly bouncing around the room pointing out things that he thought were clues clues while the parents dismissed every idea he had and told him to stop getting so excited. The parents took charge and proceeded to ignore the obvious clues he was pointing out and spent most of the time pursuing dead ends. Sad part is his instincts were more often than not correct but his parents just didn't listen and refused to let him explore and try stuff out.\n\nHopefully his curiosity and enthusiasm survives them.

Dude calls up to set up a proposal, I ask what room he wants etcetera. So then I tell him the total price to book out the entire room for the proposal. He says he just wants to buy the two tickets for him and his girlfriend, I tell him we can't have strangers playing a game that their experience is impacted/altered by the fact that there's a proposal going on. Proposal happens in an Escape Room, there's no longer a game, it becomes about the proposal. I know this because I've seen it happen a hundred times. \n\nAnyway, dude refuses to buy out all of the tickets. Says he wants strangers to be there, he's not going to buy the other four tickets. I hand the phone to my manager, they hash out details together. \n\nOver the next three weeks leading up to the proposal, this guy calls every. Single. Fucking. Day. There's nothing else to figure out, we've got it all set up, but this guy is constantly badgering us. \n\nThe big day rolls around, he arrives early so he can hide out, and this dude is a kid. Like, pimple-faced, voice-cracking, hair-growing-in-weird-places kind of kid. Everybody in the control room is talking about him, because he's been a thorn in our collective sides for weeks, and we're speculating about telling him marriage at his age is a horrible idea, but whatever it's too late. \n\nSo he hides, the girl and her friends show up, they get started and we stash the dude in the second hidden room that they'll eventually end up in. Everybody crowds around the monitor to watch and this guy pulls out a bouquet of flowers and unfurls a sign that says \"NAME REDACTED, will you go with me to PROM?\"\n\nAnd the entire staff loses their collective shit. Weeks of constant pestering, endless phone calls, and the most stressful proposal deal we've ever put together. For a fucking PROMposal. \n\nShe said no. ",

    "body": "I created an escape in France with my wife, and we have a few nice things that happened to us. A room we have settles in 1979 were you have to go in the appartment/hideout of a gang of bank robbers to find back something for the government (based on a real story happened in our city). Sincce we do have a time machine which is the starting point of our all our stories, we send time agents on duty for our clients. Here the government that want theses cold war informations back.\n\n- we had a wedding proposal for which we changed the story where the guy actually hired us to find back and object that was stolen to his parents. The wedding ring happened to be this family previous object. => really nice wedding proposal and moment\n\n- in this mission, they are books. We made them casual and numerous so it is quite obvious no hidden info are on one random book there: on players spent most of the game to not participate anything but carefully look all over the books if something was strange. He was looking two things: if the page numbers were in order, and if a letter was not circled in a book. Even with multiple very straight forward clues, he did not wanted to stop because maybe the clues could be false leads.\n\n- as you could imagine, often and despite contrary briefing rules, people break things, including ceiling (in case some paper inside), wooden floor, write on the wall so everybody can see all info (despite white papers available). One time, someone litterally told us: \"it's ok, it's easy to change\" after breaking a furniture door to see what's inside.\n\n- we have on a mission a high, thin furniture, a big like those big old wood clock (I don't know the english name). A key is visible at the bottom and you have to fish it with cable and a magnet. On family wanted to pull there 5 yo boy inside, hanging by the feet: dangerous as hell !\n\n- Some players really look at strange, weird, overkilled theories to solve some challenges while it is actually the easiest part of the game. They sometimes are really insistive for us to say it was reaaaallly hard just so that players have no chances.\n\n- One day, we had the worst group ever. Well just as we have the best record for the room, you have to get the worst right ! They made about 10% of the game with help. By the end, and because we want them to see the full story, we help them like \"good, you found this information, our machine can compute the code, it's xxx, now you just have to [explain litterally how]. When the family left, the father told me \"really, not everyone can go through ? This seems so easy!\" hum... yes sure ! you were the best !\n\n- We have in one of our room a safe that is written on \"max three tries before definitely locked\". You have about 12 similar object with codes that are obviously for the safe and you must determine the correct one. One day, a player tried randomly  three out of them. After the safe locked, we had to unlocked it for them to continue. The player immediatly tried out three other ones. The safe locked again. Second manual intervention to unlock it. The player tried another one code and open the safe. At the endd of the game, I came back to it, to offer showing how to get the proper code. Answer: \"not need, I found it. It was quite easy actually.\" I pointed out randomly was not how it was meant: \"I did not made randomly, I made it by elimination. It's a pretty easy strategy\". Ohoh, did I mention it was the same player then the previous one ?!!\n\nThe thing I hate the most is when players get out of the room and because they did not succeed in some part are really insistive in saying: \"ok so we agree this [obviously some props requiring days of work] stuff was totally useless ?\". I sometimes don't know how to let them know that they litteraly ask the solution clue instead of trying. \n\nMy bad english (sorry for it) may sound like I am a hatefull personn. But really I really love my players and our missions. We do create the missions, the stages decor and every props ourself with my wife with all our heart. We do also mostly have marvellous players, and we have great post-game conversations, some times even quite long !",

The room was separated into two sections like a normal bank is, the customer area (where you normally go when you enter the bank) & the banker area  (where you go when you are a bank employee). Wellll..... the two areas are separated by a wall type fence thus resulting in about a foot of empty space between the end of the fence and the ceiling.  You can probably tell where this is going.\n\nThis group was stumped on how to solve the code on the door leading into the banker area so one goes, \"Can't we just climb the wall?\". I immediately sprung into action and frantically ding them over and over (There is a TV where you receive clues and when you hear the ding that means there is a new clue)... unfortunately this was a group of two different bookings so one group read the message but was too timid or didn't care to relay the \"DO NOT CLIMB\" message I was spamming them with. In about a second a man climbed the wall and got into the second part.\n\nI ended up having to open the door, go in and let him out. I think they all saw I was steaming because they apologized after. I told them I am just glad no one got hurt because that could have been reaaaaaaaaaaaally bad.\n\n**Also when a group of 10 year olds left me this gem:** http://imgur.com/a/4Tj2v ",

I always feel bad for this reason, because a lot of the puzzles directly depend on English wordplay and stuff like that. But they seem to have fun just being with their kids, so we all have fun together.\n\nOne time a family came in that seemed to fit this profile. I'm not sure which country of origin they had, but they seemed Asian-American to me. But I am an uneducated buffoon, so I couldn't tell you what language the parents spoke. They spoke very sparingly in their original language, and the children spoke in accented English. They went through the room, the children solving most of the puzzles, and the father following them around silently with a notepad and pen, nodding and writing things as they found clues. \n\nThey got out, I took their picture, and they left, and everyone seemed to have had a good time. When we clean up the room, we have to rip several of the pages off from the notepad so people can't see the clues or even the indents of the clues people had written down from previous games. I was looking forward to seeing what language the father had been writing in the whole time.\n\nI reset the room, then get to the notepad, only to find [the first page in perfect English:](http://imgur.com/5TPNeno) \"What if we can't get out? Do we die in here? \n\nI burst out laughing, realizing this man was hilarious and I wanted to chase him down and take his family to lunch, then I flipped to [the next page:](http://imgur.com/TfGwdGd) \"Day 56 our rations are running low.

We were supposed to get the word Waterloo from a series of clues and use a dictionary to find that the battle of Waterloo was in 1815. Use that 4 digit number to get a key that let us out of the room. Well we got the word 'eaterloi' instead of Waterloo. We assumed that it was an anagram and we used a word scrambler to get the word aerolite from it. Using the dictionary we found that aerolite was invented in 1815. Well we got the key and we confidently told the employee how we figured it out. He was dumbfounded. I'm not exactly sure what the odds of solving the room like this is, but if someone could solve that for us that'd be dank. My friends and I have been trying to figure it out since it happened.",

I learned very quickly to give thorough warnings at the start of each show that breaking things, assaulting actors (this was trapped in a room with a zombie), and sexual harassment were not cool.  (Yes, literally had guys harass THE FUCKING ZOMBIE mid show). \n\nPerhaps the most interesting phenomenon I noticed was just how much personality factors into the teamwork involved. I've seen a lot of shy people or people otherwise lacking in confidence be completely on the right track, only to be steamrolled by the loudest, more confident, strongest personalities in the room. Maybe it shouldn't have come as so much of a surprise, but I watched perfectly smart, reasonable people actively ignore good points, logic, and strong evidence in service of a cult of personality of charismatic players. The whole thing felt like a depressing study on group dynamics. \n\nEdit: changed \"hit on\" to \"harass\" for greater accuracy. I've explained circumstances in follow up comments. ",

    "body": "Finally an AskReddit I can help with! I have too many stories for the Escape Room I help manage.\n\nOne situation quickly came to mind when I read this. In our prison style escape room we have a laser maze that players need to crawl/climb through to deactivate and move forward. Two players are required to finish (or so I thought) the laser maze because there are 3 buttons to be pressed, where the third button is out of reach from the other two.\n\nA family came in to play our game with a younger boy, a very fit (relevant) girl in her early twenties, their parents, and their grandfather who had some disability that required him to use those crutches that wrap around your forearms. So they play through and get to the laser maze. The girl got through fairly easily, but they needed to move fast since the timer was running. The young boy had a great idea, \"Here! Use grandpa's crutch!\" At which point he takes the crutch straight from grandpa and slides it past all the lasers to his sister at the other end. I was fascinated at this point but even with the crutch it was a long stretch to hit them all. The girl took a second to find the right spot on the floor, planted her foot there, went into a perfect perpendicular stretch with one foot on the ground, one foot on the far button, on hand on the middle button, and finally reaching the last button with the crutch.\n\nThat family came out of the room so proud and she boasted to the family about her daily yoga, almost convincing me to sign up for yoga because it was so impressive. That was one of the most creative and weirdest successful solutions to a puzzle I've seen in my years working there.",

Ohh boy do I have tales.\n\nPair of drunken female twenty somethings were dragged along to a group event, proceeded to demand DJ services and cartwheel in skirts before collapsing to the ground and splaying out. Odd time.\n\n\nA room of ours has a one-hitter as past of our props, a lady attempted to steal it by slowly moving it out of sight as conspicuously as possible. We insinuated that their next clue was inside the bowl, and she left out of embarrassment after she surrendered it to her group.\n\n\nA customer opened a cryptex at the beginning of the game, figured out how the mechanism was set, the reset it to a secret word and closed it. I guessed PENIS, it was PENIS. Case closed.\n\n\nThose are the oddest, but the job is full of odd behavior, strange social situations, and bizarre experiences.\n\nEDIT: Ok, so you guys seemed to like these, so I'll just keep adding them. \n\nYou see a lot of curious behaviors when people forget how they're presenting themselves. I personally find group social standings SUPER interesting. Girls, you're right about half the time, about half of the guys that come through are super dismissive of things you say.\n\nBonus points if you SOUND dumb. Not if you are dumb, just if you sound, like, um, kind of like a valley girl? Or if you speak with a questioning inflection? Y'know? \n\nBecause you can have the right answer written and proved and people won't listen to you.\n\nIt's incredible how much of a family dynamic you can see at play when puzzles get tough.  You see kids get praised, grounded, elated, yelled at. It's awful to see little jimmy investigating a false bottomed box and his Dad angrily tells him to stop touching stuff.\n\nPeople forget the rule about using very little force always. One of our rooms has a set of fake doors that don't open or go anywhere, I've watched a guy pry it off the wall before I could stop him.\n\nEach clue is tailored to where you are, and how you are too. So I can have more fun with groups that have some humor, but I also type out these clues. More than twice I've had to call in to rooms because after asking for a clue, a woman will try and convince me to give them a clue for flashing the camera. But the clue is already on its way, and as fun as it sounds, I don't want to convince anyone they get clues by flashing me.\n\n\nI wear a beard, and for this job I now have a heavily curled moustache, people ask me if it's fake VERY often.

Also they're saluting.\n\nOk... that's weird.\n\nThe person who brought them both was their aunt from the sounds of it, and she just sat there on her phone in the waiting room, looking pissed off that this was even happening.  Over the course of the introductions it became increasingly apparent that these kids were severely on the spectrum and probably should not have been doing something like this without a full group of friends and family.\n\nWell, they got a family at least.\n\nMy family.\n\nAnyways, we get in there, and it's pretty neat.  There's a Zombie actor on a chain who will try and crawl at people and tag them.  Every now and again, a buzzer sounds and she goes back into a room and the chain extends another few feet and she comes back.  So you have to have zombie distractors (by singing) and puzzle solvers.\n\nApparently though, our two sidekicks are absolutely terrified of zombies.  They shrieked and pushed themselves up against the farthest wall possible.  One of them pooped himself at some point.

I like to imagine the procter would've called it off and refunded them once he saw how utterly incapacitated they were.\n\nBut they said they had a good time, and other than a few wafts of poo here and there, we did too.\n\nAt the risk of going to hell, the whole thing was really funny in a 'I can't believe these series of events are happening' kind of way.  Still furious about their aunt,  but it's a story to share at least.

A lot of what people have already mentioned; Taking off / putting on the clothes in the room, trying to eat things in the room ( both things they brought and things they found ) trying to punch holes in the walls and climb into the cielings...Cut up the carpet, convince themselves that they're still 'IN THE ROOM' after they've finished ( still looking for puzzles and stuff ) but more often than not the 'weird' stuff is related to demographic / religious circumstances or issues. Stuff like the hyper-catholic hispanic family that took one step into the room with the ouija board puzzle and then instantly sprinted out of the room and demanded a refund. \n\nReally, it's a lot of religious stuff. When I started the job, my manager was like, \"You've got to be extra careful with the jews.\" At first I thought he was being a real fucker. But it turns out that 90% of our customer base are full on Hacidic or otherwise orthodox jewish families. We don't know why, perhaps, as a tight-knit community, we're just deep into a chain of personal recommendations. Regardless, they are lovely people, but they've many proclivities. A jewish couple will come in and explain that they can't be locked in a room together for religious purposes ( A man and a woman that aren't married can't be alone in a room together ) so we need to come in and 'check' on them every few minutes. I'll explain, hey, you're on camera the whole time and never *locked* in, but it won't do. I've often wondered if the couples we frequently have are there out of some sort of perverse fascination with being FORCED to be locked in a room with one another. Otherwise, why choose to do something that is so antithetical to the rules of their religion?\n\nOne such couple actually proposed to each-other in the room, and then just sort of smiled and barely touched each other. They came out all smiles saying they were so thrilled to be engaged but like, not enough to touch one another I guess. (Edit: As /u/ittsbitts points out, just as the couples are not allowed to be in a room together, they are also not allowed to touch one another until marriage. An aspect of hacidicism I frequently and painfully forget! You'd think I'd have learned by now, after trying many, many times to high-five an orthodox jewish woman post-escape and getting left hanging in the worst way.)\n\nProposals in general can be weird. Often they go great, but, ultimately the people NEED to get out, so that they can find the ring hidden in the end. Even if they're not doing well, they need to escape. That circumstance is always a bummer - It'll be two people, just the couple. Only the guy is completely freaking out the whole time about having to pop the question at the end, so, the girl ends up dragging the guy through the whole thing, doing all the work - Or, worse, we give them all the answers after an hour of standing around - All to reveal this ring at the perfect moment, only, that moment is completely ruined by this newfound perspective you have on your fiance, as this completely bumbling idiot who didn't solve one fucking puzzle the whole time\n\nOtherwise I get a lot of weird solutions from individuals based on the strange shit they bring in the room. There's one puzzle that requires you to use a thermal imaging camera - Well, our buddy skipped that because he just so happened to have one with him. That's pretty extreme, otherwise it's just a bunch of magnets they have or knowing morse code when the room expects them to find a translation sheet...IDK, there's a billion things. I'll try to remember some more specifics. \n\nEdit: More stories! We have a corporate group rate; large business groups can have all their employees come in and team up to get out. Only, our location specializes in private events; that means that if you come with just one other person you can have the room to yourselves. This means the rooms are small. If we have a big corporate group, we'll split the group into teams of 8, and have all the groups start at once and try to get out of seperate rooms, to 'see who gets out first'. Only the rooms are all very different - Entirely seperate sets of puzzles, each testing very different types of thinking. Sounds fun! Only, having your whole office split into teams and then see who's the 'best' at objectively different tests can lead to some really cringey situations.\n\nYou'll have one group of 8 get out two minutes before another group of their co-workers, who is also just about to get out - and then, every time, without fail, a group of buttoned up CEOs and their co-workers, all in their 50's, suddenly degenerate into shrieking teenagers, banging on the doors to the other room and shouting through the walls about how they're losers. Worse yet is when one corporate group will escape and another will not - The gloating is so goddamned cringey. Talk about \"team building\"...\n\nAlso, one of our rooms has a CPR dummy in it. You're meant to take an endoscopy camera and stick it down his throat to find a puzzle. The things people have done to that poor guy...and with that endoscopy camera. In their mouths, in their butts, in the walls, in the electrical sockets...they have stuck that camera anywhere you can think of. ",

    "body": "I worked in an escape room for 2 years. I've seen it all. Besides the typical piss, vomit and proposals I've seen some weird shit.\n\nI've seen two different couples literally break up in one of my escape rooms.\n\nI've seen a full grown man push over his nephew to open the final the door (He thought he was going to break the room record... he was 15 minutes off)\n\nOne of our rooms has a hidden Ring box in it which has caused many mini-heart attacks.\n\nCouple attempted to have sex in a corner they thought I couldn't see on the camera\n\nTwo Chinese parents brought their 3 children to our escape room and yelled at them for an hour because the kids \"weren't smart enough to break the record\". The parents didn't help at all they stood in the corner and literally yelled at all 3 children. \n\nBaby shower in our escape room\n\nSame guy brought multiple tinder dates to our escape room and did the same room every time so he knew all the answers. He always payed and He never tried to break the record so I let it slide. The girls were always so impress with him. \n\nTeenagers climbed though the ceiling tiles\n\nGroup gets so drunk in the room that half of them passed out and had to kick them out\n\nMom drops her kids off like it's a daycare and expects me to \"keep them busy\" for two and a half hours during a one hour escape room... at 10pm\n\nThe best group I've ever seen inside my room was a family of stoners. Mom, dad, son, sons gf, and daughter. All reeked of weed coming into the building. They had 90% of the room solved in about 15 minutes and I was freaking out. Even called my boss and I remember saying \"I have 5 stoners about to break the record by 20 minutes\". But then all of the sudden all 5 got burnt out. They sat in a circle and talked to each other for about 45 minutes in the middle of the room. They took 1 hour and 15 minutes to finish. \n\nI feel like I could write a book about my experience working at an escape room. It was the most fun I've ever had at a job but at the same time I was so stressed out every time I was there. 10/10 would work there again. \n\n\nEdit: words",

    "body": "So I work at an Escape Room and here's just a few of the WAY TOO MANY things I've seen.\n\nIn one of our rooms you unlock a chest that has 4 water bottles. You have to pour them into a big fish bowl (with a thin neck) so you can reach your hand in and pull a bottle out. On them it specifically says DO NOT DRINK. Guy thought it was commanding him to drink them and without hesitation straight up started drinking one. Mfw it's literally ocean water because the room is pirate themed\n\nIn a prison escape room guy and girl were doing it alone and looking for a way too real experience and argued over who should be able to put on the handcuffs for the whole game, wasted 10 minutes doing that, handcuffs get jammed and stuck on the girl, had to call the fire department to get them off\n\nGuy had called us way ahead of time and said he's going to propose to his GF in the room. We help him set up a custom box in the room and alter a puzzle. He proposes early on in the room, she says no straight up, THEN THEY AWKWARDLY FINISH THE ROOM. Meanwhile when they got out I had to go up and weirdly congratulate them on getting out and guide them back out through the door. Worst 10 minutes of my life\n\nAnother room is a ransom type room where your child has been kidnapped. When the people (all 30's and 40's) popped open the secret room where the kidnapper was hiding, a lady literally shit herself when she saw the mannequin kidnapper. Straight up shit herself right there. I let my manager deal with it, I'm no shit toucher",

    "body": "Actual Escape Room employee here, and I have quite a bit of stories.\n\n\n1) What drives a group of people to get highly intoxicated and go do something that involves using your brain? I have no idea, but it happens a lot. \n\n\nIt was a girl's 21st birthday and everyone was drunk, but she was plastered. She ended up lying on the floor and not moving, and we didn't know if she was okay, so we send someone in to check on her and she said she was just resting and laughed it off. Later, the same girl laughed so hard that she fell down and pissed all on the floor.\n\n\n2) One guy had dip in his mouth and decided to spit in the corner of the room instead of in his bottle.\n\n\n3) One lady completely threw up in a room and they all just kept laughing. When asked if she was okay by my coworker, she responded with, \"oh, I just throw up when I get really excited!!\"\n\n\n4) Two guys were doing a room and thought the next step they needed to do \"looked gay\" so they  ended up sitting down on the floor and staring around (since you aren't allowed to have your phone) for the last 30 minutes of the room.\n\nEdit: I can't give away too much because of my employee agreement, but it had to do with blowing on something in the room. I think it was more funny because of the fact that they wouldn't do it because of their pride, rather than it actually *looked gay*.\n\n\n5) We've also had a lot of marital arguments and tests of friendship that do NOT end well. \n\nSide note: whatever you do, NEVER do an escape room for a first date. You'll more than likely have a group of strangers with you and it's also just super awkward all around.\n\n\nOn a brighter note, we've had some proposals in our escape rooms!\n\n\nIf I think of some more, I'll edit this post.\n\n\nEdit 2: There was a proposal one time near the end of the room where instead of kissing they shook hands and kept on doing the room.\n\n\nEdit 3: I don't know HOW I forgot this story because it's the best one!\n\n\nIf a group doesn't show up 10 minutes before their start time, we call to ask if they're making their way or not. Well this guy put his home phone number and when we called, his wife answered, but she had no idea what we were talking about. We asked for her name and she wasn't on any booking information, so we assumed it was a wrong number. Well the husband shows up with A DIFFERENT FAMILY. She seemed to be his girlfriend by the way they flirted in the room, and she also had kids. Then, when they escaped, he refused to have his picture taken. We called that event, \"the night of Affair Guy.\"\n\n\nEdit 4: New employee's first day happened to be a Saturday night. The lady in the room lifted her shirt and flashed the camera for the new guy and the trainer to see. Later she comes out of the room and said, \"wait, is someone really watching us on the camera?\"\n\n\nEdit 5: It's also REALLY easy to see your thong through your too-tight leggings on a night vision camera...",

    "body": "Manager at an escape room here. I have a few incidents that stick out to me the most. \n\n\n* I've had about 3 people try to change their baby's diaper on one of the tables in our room. Luckily, I would run in there in time to tell them they have to do that outside of the room while receiving death glares in the process. I told one guy he couldn't change his baby in the room, so he did it in our lobby instead, with the bathrooms being maybe 15 feet down the hall.  \n\n\n* I had a group of high school cheerleaders come in and they were going to prop one girl up with their hands to get the \"clue\" on the ceiling. \n\n\n* We have free-standing lockers in one of our rooms and we've had people hang from the top and the lockers have almost toppled over them. \n\n\n* We had a scanner that scanned a fake hand to open a door, but some guy punched the glass in on the scanner and ripped out all the wiring. Some people do a very poor job at distinguishing what is and is not important to solving the room. \n\n\n* We had an event for an AA group, but they were all on ecstasy (I don't understand, either). One guy had no shirt on, only a bow tie. He proceeded to dance on the desk in the room and later passed out on said desk. \n\n\n* Each of our rooms has two rooms. We had a group of guys (frat dudes) solve the first room, but they thought that was it. They starting screaming and sprinting out of the door they came in through (which we tell them beforehand is not the door they're trying to escape through). They opened the door to the office where I was watching them, still screaming, said OOPS SORRY through the screaming, and ran into our lobby, still screaming. I had to awkwardly tell them that they weren't done and they ran back to the room, screaming. The all happened in the span of like 15 seconds.\n\n\nI'm sure I have more but those are the ones that I remember the most at this moment. It's a doozy, but it is definitely one of the most entertaining jobs I have ever had. \n\nEDIT:\n\n\n* Had a group of engineers with Ph.Ds come do our hardest room. I explained the hint system to them, like how I will ask them if they want a hint if they look like they're stuck. They were about 15 minutes in and hadn't solved anything, so I asked them if they wanted a hint. The guy looked at the camera and said, \"Burn in hell,\" not jokingly. They only solved 3 puzzles. \n\n\nEDIT x2:\n\n\nI can't believe I forgot to mention my favorite group!!!\n\n* So these 3 guys came in stoned out of their minds. I gave them the rules and stuff and put them in the room and started the timer. The room was FBI-themed so we had a large conference table and 4 desk chairs. They sat at the desk for probably 5 minutes before starting. They only did one thing: they found a barely-hidden key. They didn't solve any actual puzzles. So, at the end, I go in and say \"Uh...times up, guys...\" They proceed to tell me that they had so much fun and they can't wait to come back and do our other room. One of the guys even shook my hand. The room took me 30 seconds to reset, LOL. They did, indeed, come back and do our other room. They were not stoned, or less stoned, and did much better the 2nd time. Never forget. ",

    "body": "Former escape room (not Escape the Room) employee--everything everyone else has said absolutely believable. People are unbelievably destructive. I've seen people rip outlets out of walls (we had to warn them not to stick keys in), dismantle furniture and electronics, pull vent covers off the air ducts, physically bend back file cabinet drawers to get around the lock. They'll write all over all the clues, even deliberately go against the rules you set because they think you were trying to trick them. We had a group reset the password on our computer so we had to wipe it and reinstall everything (lesson learned for the game makers, always have an admin account!). A woman decided to throw--literally throw--every non-clue glass object into a trash can, leaving me with 10 minutes to reset the room AND clean up a mountain of broken glass. A favorite was \"She said not to use the fire extinguisher unless there's a fire... and this says 'Warning, flammable!'\"\n\nBut the weirdest thing is the waves of groupthink*. It's noticeable to everyone, my boss even warned me about it my first day. A meaningless picture might be hanging on the wall, completely ignored by every group for months, until suddenly you have a wave of 10 groups in a row who take it off the wall and dismantle it because they've become convinced it means something. They'll drawn new conclusions from a note that have never been drawn before, and the game makers never intended. They'll follow the same, incorrect process for solving a puzzle that we haven't seen before, or make the same arithmetic/decryption errors. They'll MISREAD things the same way, even mishear audio clues the same way (as in, repeat the same nonsense words to describe what they heard). They'll physically destroy the same props, locks, or set pieces game after game.

Naturally, we declined to offer any answers and he sulked to his girlfriend, who was encouraging his dumb request but oh, that's too bad babe. \n\n\nAnother time, a couple wanted us to help them announce their pregnancy to friends by putting up a  \"We're Pregnant!\" poster in one of the rooms (we had multiple rooms per escape zone).

This is my go to memory whenever other players ask me if anyone gets really into the escape zones. \n\n\nLike previously mentioned by other employees here, I've also unwillingly participated in prom-posals (cringey-cute) and marriage proposals (why??).

    "body": "Finally I can share this story on reddit!\n\nSo, in my six months or so in an Escape Room I had the privilege to witness to the worst players ever. I'm convinced this six-man gang came from a strange cult that sees logical thinking as a capital sin or something.\n\nAs soon as they walk in and I explain them the rules, I'm met with empty eyes and a fair deal of general confusion. No big deal, had my fair share of dummies... but I immediatly identified the leader. A lanky guy, with soulless blue eyes and a dull smile. There was something odd about him, like he wasn't *supposed* to be there and just randomly walked in an escape room. I  knew he was up to no good, but i put up my best smile and I explained them the rules. The usual stuff, don't mess up the room, find the culprit and yadda yadda yadda.... after the final plead (\"And don't bother lifting the carpets, this is not a treasure hunt, you'll find nothing!\") I lock em in and go to the control room.\n\nThey immediately start looking under *everything*, ignoring the first lock of the game (a goddamned black box HANGED ON A WALL, in plain sight) and giggling like demented schoolgirls. I sigh and start giving hints via the screens in the room... it's gonna be a long hour.\n\nThere's way too much to say, so I'll just go with a bullet list of my favourites:\n\n* As I said, it wasn't a treasure hunt. There wasn't much to *find*, but a lot to *solve*, but they immediately go full CSI. \"I think you'll find nothing behind the paintings, gentlemen!\" I type. They laugh and pull all the paintings down.\n* After multiple attempts, i pretty much tell them the first, four-digit combination to open the black box, \"1030\". They start flicking the lights and counting, presumably to get to 1030. I stop them before.\n* A girl tries to climb the huge wardrobe, almost knocking out cameras, mics and shit. I stop her, she apologizes and almost rips a stove from the opposite wall.\n* When they finally find the UV light, the leader tries to shine it on the wardrobe's lock. He's visibly disgruntled that it doesn't somehow open.\n* I try to guide them towards opening the wardrobe (a magnetic lock; they were supposed to touch two pommels on the sides of the wardrobe and hold each other's hands, \"closing the circle\" and thus solving the little riddle). They're close, two of them are touching the things. I told them to hold hands. They let go and hold hands in the middle of the room, looking betrayed because it's not working. I tell them to \"close the circle\" between the two pommels. The leader tries to do so but alone, and obviously his arms are not long enough. They make the connection 5 minutes later.\n* They open the damn thing  and discover the second, secret room. The leader walks in, says that's really cool, and walks back out. They reamain in the first room, losing time until i kinda order em in.\n* They start fiddling with a chessboard, ignoring all the other games in the room. It was there just for flavor, but they seem convinced that arranging the pieces in a certain way will open a third, secret room (???). I take pity on em and explain that the chessboard isn't part of the game.\n* They struggle with the first enigma, but they seem to be learning. I'm starting to feel sort of proud, it's like watching a gorilla start to understand sign language. Fisheyes mcGee ruins everything (\"GUYS! IT'S THE CHESSBOARD FOR SURE!\") And they start fiddling with the pieces again.\n\nThey made *me* pause the game and enter the room. So at one point they need to use a little magnet they found in a previous chest to unlock another magnetic lock. That's actually kind of difficult to figure out, so I start to help em almost immediately. They still don't seem to understand, so I basically type them the solution (something I *very* rarely did, as I felt that it took away fun from the players). Something like \"OK, the little white thing is a magnet. USE IT where the laser points\". So they start looking around. What white thing? Was there *ever* a white thing? At first it was funny, then it started to become tragic.  \n\nThey fucking *lost* the magnet in a 5x7m room.  \n\nI pause the game, I go in, thinking I could help em find it. I invite them to look in their pockets and around solved chests, but the damn thing just wouldn't come out.\n\nThen an epiphany hits me. I walk to the big, metal stove in the first room and start fiddling behind it... and there it fucking is.\nOne of the baboons just fucking *stuck* it to the metal behind the stove and just *left and forgot about it*.\n\n  \nWhen the game came to an end, they had reached 60% completion. Bear in mind, the general consensus was to *force* people to reach at least 70% so players don't feel bad... but I just couldn't do it.\nAt least they had a lot of fun and even tipped me.  \n\nI'll never forget them. It was like being catapulted in the twilight zone, they had something surreal going on.",

One of theme is themed where you are escaping a zombie chained to the wall.  For that room we have two actors and here is a great example why.  I was working as the mad scientist host and one of my employees was the zombie.  \n\nThis particular group had two groups of people.  A family of four, and a group of 6 friends.  The family of four had a couple teenagers and they were really excited and asking a bunch of questions.  Both groups were excites and had 8 out of the 10 people there and we were just waiting for two people.

So I made sure to remind him to not throw things in the room, he asked to be reminded of the rules again so I did.\n\nI was keeping an eye on him and saw him make a beeline for the zombie next.  This isn't uncommon, but he decided to antagonize the zombie by asking if he wanted to take a bite out of him and posturing...beating his chest and other things.  The zombie then of course started making enthusiastic head nods and made motions like he was eating a turkey leg.  Sam apparently did not like that so he then took off his hoodie, hockey player style and threw it at the zombie.  It landed squarely on the zombie's head and he proceeded to remove it and throw it into the space that is his and growed....\"Mine....now....\"  Sam, not appreciating the fact that the zombie is familiar with doing improv and the concept of \"Yes, and\" got angry and took off his t-shirt and tossed it at the zombie next after doing his best twirls of it over his head like a Petey Pablo extra.  Screaming things like \"Oh yeah?!  You want a piece of this?!  I will break you in two! Piece if zombie shit!\" Etc and removed his t-shirt and threw it at the zombie as well.  \n\nOf course at this point everyone had stopped and stared at him waiting to see what happened next.  Upon receiving a new shirt the zombie threw it with the hoodie and said \"Thanks. I needed a new shirt too.\"  \n\nSam, of course was still angry and then continued posturing and such...and went to remove his pants.  I crossed that room so fast and told him that he was out of line, and he needed to leave.  Sam immediately smiled a creepy smile at me and said ok.  His girlfriend joined him and I escorted him out of the building.\n\nI went back into the room.  Put some more time on the clock, apologized on his behalf and continued game play.  Everyone was visibly relieved and got straight to work.  They even got out of the room, worked well as a group and had a blast.\n\nI later found out from the bouncer for the bar next door that he saw the guy kick over our sidewalk sign, pro-wrestler style with both feet.  The bouncer was kind enough to put our sign back up for us.  \n\nKeep in mind the whole thing with the clothes and zombie thing happened in a span of first contact to me kicking him out happened in about a span of less than a minute.  People taunt the zombie all the time, but he was clearly over the line.",

    "body": "Hey, I'm finally relevant in a thread now! I manage an extremely popular room escape business in western Canada. I have a few stories:\n\n1) One of our puzzles required wearing a pair of glasses to look at an LCD screen, while another player spins a dial to change what is shown on the screen. A grandma with what appeared to be her three grandchildren were playing it, and the grandma was getting very aggressive with the kids. The youngest kid ended up standing in the corner saying \"Well if you're not going to be nice then I'm not gonna play anymore.\" The grandma resolved this situation by smacking him upside the head a few times until he cried. It was awkward.\n\n2) We had a group punch a hole through the wall, and drop a bunch of magnets that were needed for a puzzle into the crack in the wall. This happened two hours into a Saturday shift, meaning we had to take apart the whole wall when we only have five minutes between our rooms to fix this monstrosity, and we ended up breaking the bottom of the wall, reaching in with our hands and grabbing them, and then covering up the whole ordeal with a bookshelf. \n\n3) The same group that put a hole in the wall came back and did another room, and they didn't understand anything that was happening. They refused assistance to further themselves along, and spent the last ten minutes of their time making out in the corner. We had to physically intervene when she propped herself up on a counter, and he started taking off his belt... We put that to an end real quick. They might rent the room by the hour but keep your damn clothes on. \n\n4) The oddest one by far however, was a guy who called and was speaking to a female employee who we'll call... 'Female Employee'. Nice. When he called from what I was told, was that he had told her that she had a really pretty voice and wanted to know her name. She told him her name (no idea why, that's weird as fuck) and then he asked when she'd be working because he wanted to come meet her. He ended up booking and paying for a whole room ($210 CAD for a single person) and when he showed up he asked if it could just be him and her (the female employee) in the room. She got really uncomfortable and called me over to deal with him. When I asked him to tone down his behavior he got really defensive and told me that I was selfish for keeping her all to myself. What? I asked him to leave or else I'd be calling the police. When we left work at 1am that night, there were only our two cars parked out front with a running car at the end of the road (cul-de-sac with Mon-Fri businesses so there should be no other cars) and the car followed her when we left. I ended up following both of them while calling the police but the creepy guy fucked off down one of our busier roads and never heard from him again.\n\n5) You cannot bring babies into the room. I don't know why you would want to bring a two week old baby into a room designed around horror and people jumping out at you, and if you try to bring your baby you will be denied entrance. I usually end up babysitting for an hour when this happens as long as the parents are nice. If you are rude, I have the power to make you not escape despite how smart you think you are. Your ability to escape is literally controlled by me, if I want you to escape with 5 seconds left I can, and if I want you to escape with twenty minutes left I can.\n\nLots of people try to have sex. Key word try. We have to shut that shit down right away because A) it's disgusting and B) I feel like there's some legal shit that could go down if that came out. Also alcohol. When groups come in that have been consuming alcohol, we have to watch them super close because they try to do a lot of stupid shit when drunk. Why you'd mix puzzles and logical thinking with booze I'll never know, but you pay me so I don't really care. \n\nA couple common questions I'll answer:\n\n\"Haha can I get the video footage so I can show my family in seventeen years at a wedding?\" No, we do not give out video footage. Some places might do it like when you get a photo on a roller coaster, but if I were to give you the one hour long video footage of you in the room, you could pretty much do anything with it and post it online, ruining the experience for those who haven't been here before. We try really hard to keep our rooms as surprising as possible because we love to scare our customers.\n\n\"Why do I have to put my phone in a locker? I'm expecting a call.\" If you're expecting a call, then leave your phone with your game master. We will come and get you if your babysitter calls. We do NOT want you to have phones in the room for two main reasons, being that you could take photos and videos in the room and spoil it all, and that we also have fairly strong magnets and don't want to chance you rubbing up against it and somehow injuring your phone. (Our only exception is Selena Gomez, she got to keep her phone on her when she came in)\n\n\"It must be a lot of fun to watch customers all the time, and laugh at the stupid thing we do hahaha\" I always respond to this one with a smile and say something along the lines of \"Haha yeah, it's really fun to find the unique ways that people find the answer to puzzles!\" I hate watching you, unless you are a fun group that makes jokes.\n\nI have lots of stories working here, and can answer any questions if you guys have any.

Anyways my roommates and I (7 of us in total) all go into the room trying our best not to stare too much or make any comments that can be overheard. We fully understand that we're probably being recorded when we get into the room since theres a TV in each that can give us hints if they notice we're struggling. So like 10 minutes into the puzzle one of my roommates who is a bit of a loud mouth just goes, \"I wonder how many times that first girl gets hit on by guys who come in here.\" To which I immediately respond with, \"I wonder how many creepy comments she hears from guys once they get into the room and think they can't hear them...\" Right after I say that we look up to the TV because we now see there's text on it. All thats on the screen is \".....\". We all laugh not knowing if that was in response to our conversation, but we all like to imagine that it was. ",

    "body": "Actual Escape Room (experience) employee / designer here. \n\nHad a participant fake a stroke / heart attack because he thought that by doing so one of our actors would help him escape, or that it would get him outside 'his own way'. \n\nDidn't react to several questions and agreed upon codewords, safewords, exit phrases, actual human panic, several employees telling him that this is not part of the experience, that the emergency services had been called, that we shut down the experience for all of the 150 (paying) participants for the emergency services to get to him... \n\nIt was not until the police, firemen \u00e1nd ambulance people told him to stop faking it that he stopped. \n\nWe got a pat on the shoulder from the emergency services, he got served with the bills his stunt cost everyone. \n\n\nSecond weirdest was when a competitor participated and started causing trouble loudly, to make us look inadequate and unprofessional. Talking about how we mistreated his father who was mentally and physically handicapped (the man in question was neither, and very embarrassed for his son's behaviour) \n\nThe son left a very negative review. \nHis father left one too, apologising for his son. \n\n\nI have a few more i could write down in the morning.   \n\nEdit: more\n\nOk some more then. \n\n* one guy took a shit in a prison cell. In the toilet (still semi - operating at the time) thank god but he was actually sharing a cell with a young woman and he was sitting somewhat in plain view. \n\n* a guy was playing with a soccer ball, keeping it off the ground for quite some time.\nHe kicked it up to face-level, kissed the round object and repeated this every so often. \nI commented : 'you must like balls', to which he replied 'if you want to play ze ball, you have to love ze ball'. \nFist time i broke character laughing out loud. \n\n* one man was not really participating, but not really causing trouble either. He was just content being there. He walked in one cell and stayed there for some time. I asked him if everything was all right, and he said: 'yeah, just visiting my old  cell. I used to be locked up here back when it was operational' \nTurns out, he was telling the truth. \n\n* we didn't have cameras yet, and i caught a few players out of their play zone. I 'apprehended' two of them and interrogated them how they got there. Turns out one guy knew how to open doors with a plastic card for a party trick, but was able to open a door early in game. \nWhen being informed them that i couldn't escort them back yet due to me still having to play out a scene, they comllied to be extra's in it, and that they would escape alongside the group of players that were next. \nIn the scenic climax, in which the players were threatened, the two unexpectedly lunged at me and grabbed me tight. We have a 'no touching' kind of rule, but i signaled a fellow actor not to interfere, and whispered to the guys 'it's not allowed, i know you said you were gonna help what are you doing'. \n'we know, this is buying the people who are not in on it to run away as planned'\nI was amazed how well it played out. \nThe players were just about where they were supposed to go, i whispered 'ok, go, run' and they bolted, joining the rest. They game proceeded as planned. \n\nWhile i don't recommend anyone overstepping the set world and decency rules, this particular weird coincidence played out extremely well\n\n* a woman once smuggled cigarettes in, by stashing it in her maxi-pad\n\n\n\n  ",

I don't have a problem with that, I've taught English before and I'm a leadership type. I *do* have a problem with people that think they can get a medal for showing up. One of my team is great. The other two...\n\nIt's week 9 of 12 and I sent an email to the team advising two members that their contributions were consistently late, incomplete, very poor quality and thus unusable, and if things continued in this manner, I would not be able to put their names on the final submission.\n\nOne student freaked. She interpreted my words as \"You haven't given me anything\". In the ensuing email-storm, the tutor said *\"OK, meeting with me after the next tutorial.\"* The situation was clarified at the meeting and it seems the tutor's private remarks have had some effect, which is good.\n\nThe 2nd trouble-student however, has so poor English that he couldn't even follow the content of this disciplinary meeting and so just sat there, as he usually does, starting at the desk in front of him and making the occasional strange noise. At one point the tutor asked everyone to confirm a point. \n\n*\"Ben...\"* the tutor prompted. \n\nSilence. \n\n*\"BEN...\"*\n\nHuh? \\*something unintelligible*\n\n*\"I need you to confirm that you understand what we're doing from now.\"*\n\nOh, OK then silence.\n\n*\"So... what are you doing from now?\"*\n\n\\*something unintelligbile\\*\n\n*\"What have we been talking about?\"*\n\n\\*something unintelligible\\*\n\n/me facepalms.\n",

    "body": "Hello 12 year old boy, we meet again.\n\n\nOkay, story time, I'll also include some observations about people in the room, it's quite fascinating. \n\n- Had somebody that tried to destroy the heating and cooling system. He got up on a chair and tried to rip it from the ceiling, I've never been in the room faster.\n- No matter how many times you say: \"The entrance is not the exit\". When people ultimately find the \"escape-key\" they all run to the entrance.\n- I had a woman who was screaming **at the top of her lungs** that my hints were making her group fail, she was the only one complaining. When I opened the door to get her group out she was super peaceful. It's like people turn into beasts when locked up, who would've thought. \n- Had a lady who in the beginning asked: \"Can I Snapchat inside the room?\" \"No you cannot\" \"But how do people know I'm  okay?\". Yeah I didn't even knew how to respond, so I didn't.\n- Had people that:\n - Ripped the wallpaper off the wall.\n - Destroyed the floor because they think something is hidden. (We tell them there's nothing underneath it, which some people actually think is a hint)\n- There is a little \"hint-door\", we put hints behind it written on paper and I tell kids all the time: **\"THERE'S NOTHING BEHIND THAT DOOR\"**. But every damn time a kid walks up to it, starts opening and closing it before putting their hand inside. This one instance I was so done with it I *shook their hand* and let go, they freaked out and never touched that door again.\n \n- People think they can get out within 10 minutes, a lot of groups think this and then fail super hard at the most simple tasks. On the other hand, some groups are super chill and calm and solve it like nobody's business. \n- One of the most **bizarre things** is how we can fuck up relaying information, you give the hint \"4376\" and people manage to say: \"HEY WE GOT A CODE, IT'S 7364!!\". Not just with numbers, I've had people forgetting to say words in sentences and just completely screw the hint up.\n\n\n\n\nIf more people are interested I'll tell some more, it's a beautiful thing. \n",

But the trick is to realize that the game is meant to be fun, solvable, and not potentially lawsuit-inducing. \n\nTangents are inevitable, because you're trying different avenues to find a solution, so the trick is to learn when to give it up. Your brain is incredibly good at finding patterns, so you have to decide which ones are likely to be there intentionally. My boss' theory was, if you haven't made progress on something in 3 minutes, set it aside. You'll have more luck if you imagine someone is trying to communicate with you (and knows you have a time limit) than if you imagine the room is out to trick you.  A good game won't ask you to have any outside knowledge or skills and should provide everything you need to know inside the room. If you notice a pattern developing but can't put it all together yet, you may not have all the pieces, so set it aside and come back to it. They shouldn't ask you to do anything that might injure or kill you, or damage their property.\n\nEventually you do develop an instinct for how strongly the room is pointing you in a certain direction, and learn how to switch focus to pick out clues. It's its own skill set that just has to do with learning the language of puzzles. ",
