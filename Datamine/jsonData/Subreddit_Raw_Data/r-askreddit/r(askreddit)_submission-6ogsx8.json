She was able to use Child support money to get herself a degree and start a career that benefited us greatly in the long run as it set my Mom up with a decent career. My Dad and his second wife were always angry when they saw we had shoes that were getting old or jeans that were getting a little short, and my sister and I would hear about how he was giving my mom \"all this money for nothing.\" As soon as we turned 18, he summarily quit paying anything and didn't offer to help with college at all.\n\nIf he had been able to use the legal system to compel my Mom to spend Child Support in a specific way, I might never have gone to college and my Mom might still be working a register at Department Stores with no hope of retirement and probably on some kind of welfare. As it is, she was able to help us with school and she'll be retiring next year because she's been a Medical Technologist working in a lab at a local hospital for the last 25 years.",

Child support is contentious on Reddit. So far, the themes are:\n\n- yes, its 2017, we should have the technology to implement this. Maybe some magic debit card or EBT style.\n- no, current child support departments are bunged up enough, this would kill them.\n- stop giving in to your ex - if she asks for money early in the future just ask what she needs specifically and buy it for her, then take that off the subsequent payment - GOOD idea!.\n- people are petty.\n- so put a law like this in motion.

I get the argument that the parent could spend all the money on themselves but there's no good way to police it. Child support is supposed to go to everything that it requires to raise a child, which includes sports and clothes for them but also a lot of shared expenses with the adult.\n\nEdit: A lot of responses saying 'put it on a card that limits purchase types'. Again how would you implement an approved list of purchase types? It takes much more than food and clothes to raise a child, the point of child support is to make sure the child can maintain the lifestyle that would have been afforded to them if both parents were together. I had a TV in my room, should child support pay for that? Well if there was never a divorce I probably would've had it anyway so child support should go towards that. What about a vacation? I only ever vacationed with my custodial parent, should child support help to pay my plan ticket? Child support isn't just to ensure that I wasn't on the street, it's meant to maintain the lifestyle that was planned for me when both parents were together. ",

The easiest way to see that your child is being taken care of appropriately is to just talk to your child during visitation and take part in your childs life as well.

    "body": "Child support worker here, and this is just insanely unrealistic. First of all, \"supply the court with proof of how the child support money is spent\", yeahhhhhhhhhh. How do you imagine that works? Monthly hearings? That's thousands of tax payer dollars spent on judges, clerks, county attorney, CSSU, to just be present. Once we are in this prove your expenses hearing, how does the custodial parent then do so? Here in Colorado child support money can be loaded onto a specific card, so I guess that can be tracked but who deems what is appropriate expenditures and what is not?\n\nWe field this question daily from non-custodial parents. Our answer is simple, and pretty logical in my opinion. If the custodial parent has a roof over the child's head, clothes on their back, and food in their belly, then the money is being spent correctly. If the CP has enough left over to treat themselves then good for them. They're raising your kid and certainly deserve to have some personal pleasures in their life too. \n\nEdit: spelling is hard, and sorry if it sounds bitter. I get this question literally daily and it drives me insane, clearly. ",

The day he gets child support, he buys a $150 pair of boots, a $60 pair of pants, and replaces parts for his motorcycle for $300.  Karen freaks out that most of her money has gone to Rob's hobbies.  Rob produces receipts that show he spent $400 on groceries, $150 on summer clothes for the girls, and $500 in day care.  It came out of his paycheck rather than her child support.  He argues that in fact he did the right thing as a father by providing for them earlier in the month and treating himself later.\n\nThe vast majority of 'wasting my child support' cases are like that.

The mother only had to pay for three. Meanwhile, I have to buy my kid new clothes, toys and pay for activities (including summer camp so I can work) - on top of the court-ordered child support. The kids' clothes are frayed if I don't replace them and if they were purchased by her mom, they come from the bargain bin of whatever the cheapest place is. I wish I could just be ordered to directly pay for my child's expenses without giving a penny to the mother. I already spend at least twice the ordered support - one stealth alimony payment - and the other to actually meet many of the expenses of my child when she is with her mother.

    "body": "All of this is true.  Let me add a bit more perspective from an insider's POV.  The state court system in basically every single state in the U.S. is already overworked almost to the point of becoming non-functional.  No, seriously.  The caseload of an individual judge in most states has skyrocketed versus what it was in the 1980s.  The budget for support staff (law clerks especially) has dwindled to the point where a number of states rely on law clerk interns who are paid nothing, or very little.  Courts, in short, don't have anything like the administrative firepower to handle the amazingly massive amount of additional paperwork this rule would produce.\n   \nAlso, if you read this post and become concerned about whether the American state court system is about to (or already has) lost the functionality essential to allow private citizens to obtain effect redress for injuries suffered at the hands of others, good.  You should be worried.  Because if we're not already there, we're damn close.  And that fact is well-known to lawyers, and to politicians, and to people who would prefer that individual citizens NOT be able to bring effective lawsuits again, e.g., giant companies that have done wrong.",

I have three kids: 2 from my first relationship, 1 from my second. \nEx #1 doesn't pay child support, hasn't seen the kids in 5 years (fell off the face of the earth - I don't even actually know if he's still alive). He is court ordered, but hasn't paid it in years. Even if he did, he was only ordered $118 a month. I support our two kids on my own, full time, and both of them have disabilities. It's hard and it sucks, but at the end of the day I wouldn't trade the kids for the world, and I hope one day the sacrifices I made enable them to be the most functional adults they are capable of being given their disabilities. \nEx #2 also does not pay child support, but that was by mutual agreement. We have no court order set up and do not need/want one. He takes our son one or two weekends a month as his work schedule allows (he works 12 hour days, 5 - 6 days a week), and I would rather he have that money to make sure his house is in a safe area for our son, his bills are paid so our son has everything he needs when there (power, water, gas, etc.), and he has enough for food, and diapers since our son is not quite 2 yet. Anything extra, I hope he spends on what he needs so he is a functional parent and an example of the type of man our son should aspire to be - decent clothing, good shoes, a haircut (he grew his hair out once - he looked like Shaggy from Scooby Doo and it was NOT a flattering look for him), etc. and/or something for the two of them to do. I know if I go to him and say \"Yo, ex #2, I'm short on x bill by $x. Can you help?\", chances are he's going to move heaven and earth to help, because he feels the same way. In the reverse, if he needs help and I've got it, it's his and he knows that. \nIf ex #1 were involved with our kids, I would in a heart beat do the same for him. My goal has never been money - my goal has always been that my children have the best childhood I can provide them. Money can't replace their father, but at least I could say he did something for them aside from help make them if ex #1 paid it. I hope he is alive out there, and I hope one day my phone rings (have had the same phone number for years for this reason) and it's him on the other end, wanting to talk to the boys. \n\nSorry, I...went off on a tangent there for a second.

Most of the responses here are of the \"It's too costly and impractical for what is actually a relatively rare problem\" -- and that's correct, don't get me wrong -- but they're missing the central point.** Child support doesn't exist so your ex can go live the high life at your expense. Child support exists because *kids are expensive* and a parent can't walk away from that responsibility even if he/she isn't the primary caretaker. What's more, from all the numbers that have emerged since divorce became relatively common in Western life, it's pretty obvious that the parent with primary custody (whether male or female) nearly always takes a larger economic hit. Child support helps, but it doesn't fully make up for the loss of a two-parent household with unified finances.\n\n**A related topic [came up on /r/ChangeMyView two weeks ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/6lr2pd/cmv_men_should_be_exonerated_relieved_or_absolved/) and I got interested enough to look at the central question: Namely, does child support approach the true cost of raising a child?** I could only find verifiable numbers that had been collected five years apart, so that wasn't ideal, but let's assume it's ballpark. According to the U.S. Census, as of 2010 [the average monthly child support payment](https://www.census.gov/newsroom/releases/archives/children/cb12-109.html) in the U.S. is $430. As of 2015, [the average cost of raising a child to 17 in the U.S.](http://money.cnn.com/2017/01/09/pf/cost-of-raising-a-child-2015/index.html) is $233,610, or $1,145.15/month. \n\nSo the average monthly child support payment is 37.5% of the average monthly cost of raising a kid. While circumstances differ considerably between families and I'd never argue that this is a universal truth, it looks like the person paying child support is -- again, on average -- getting a much better deal financially than the custodial parent.\n\nEdit: Fixed a typo.",

Would you want the court to nit pick every minute of your time, asking why you couldn't be less selfish with how you spend it?\n\nIt's often the same parents, overwhelmingly dads but not always, who refuse to own up to their responsibility and raise their kids, but then want to turn around and micro manage and judge the parent that they've left to do all the heavy lifting.\n\nIf this sounds like you, you are an asshole. Get your shit together so you can help raise your kid or pay your asshole tax and leave the other parent to do whatever they need to do in order to get by.\n\nIf you are a parent who has 50% shared custody and is miffed that you *still* have to pay child support, I get it, that can feel unfair. Try to realize that there's a very specific formula that this is based on, in order to make your kid's living situation as stable as possible across households, and has nothing to do with you personally. If you have to, consider it the \"irresponsible procreation tax.\" \n\nSource: I'm a bad ass dad with 50% physical custody and I pay child support for the privilege of making my son's life the best it can be 100% of the time, not just when he's with me.",

    "body": "This is why a card sounds like such a good idea. It's not meant to enforce every single little purchase, but it will track if it's used on places where it shouldn't be, or consistently on things that are obviously not for the child's life (alcohol, spending in bars, etc). Perhaps an interview here and there with the kids to make sure they are needing things. If the spouse is getting suspicious or worried how their money is being spent, a card could easily give a run down. You see an expensive necklace on that card, red flag- even if it's for a child, if it's not within the means, it shows the parent being irresponsible buying gifts that should be discussed with the parent providing the money (and also allow the parent to be a part of gift giving, so the other doesn't get all the credit). Vacations? Again, something that should be discussed and agreed on. There should be a way to track if a parent went off on a Las Vegas trip with some boy/girl friend, leaving the kids at home with a grandparent/aunt/uncle etc, using the other parent's money. A parent can claim it was a vacation for the kids. An easy check of the card would show where they went, and what they bought. \n\nI'm not a parent, but I grew up in a divorced family, with one parent being incredibly selfish, spending the other's money all on themself. Then custody changed, and I got to live with the responsible parent. The spending of money on new \"friends\", going out all night, sleeping all day, leaving the kids to fend for themselves, was discovered and brought up at court. \n\nI think the biggest thing for either side is- the custodial parent fears being nickled and dimed for every little purchase, while the non custodial parent worries that their hard earned money is being spent blindly, or on stuff that is inappropriate. \n\nHaving kids together should require both parents to discuss budgets and spending, because the child still has two parents, and the child support is there to help maintain the kind of life the child would have if the parents were together. I don't think it's unrealistic for two parents to speak to each other, especially when it comes to the kid's care. Plus, purchases on a card shouldn't be used as a nickle and dime threat, it should simply track spending to ensure the custodial parent isn't getting botox, or going out to bars and blowing money on weed and alcohol. It gives both parents leverage in a way. If the amount is not enough, the custodial parent can show where they are spending and where it comes up short, while the other parent can rest a little more easy knowing they can't get away with spending on frivolous/selfish/obviously-not-for-the-kids stuff.\n \n\nEdited to add:  guys, I understand somethings require cash. When you draw up the agreements in court, parents can agree to cash limits per month. Then save the receipts in case the other parent would like a record. If I gave a lot of my money to a bank or investor and they couldn't account for what it was spent on, is be pretty upset. A non custodial parent shouldn't have to blindly trust their ex to not misuse the funds. \n\nEdit 2: if something like this was passed, it should have a start date, with all previous agreements before a certain date are grandfathered in. Also. The paying parent doesn't get to monitor very purchase while it's being bought. They only get to ask for the custodial parent's proof/explanation of spending (like the receipts), when they file for another court date to up/decrease or cease support.\n\nThere is no perfect solution that makes everyone happy. Best we can do is set up systems to help keep people honest, and just fair in general. Compromise rarely leaves both sides ecstatic, but it could help the parents focus more on their children, and less on revenge or greed.",

She always had cigarettes to chain smoke and would buy nice technology when it came out like new pc, laptop, smart phone. Meanwhile, I had two pairs of jeans also known as floodpants. I was doing my own laundry at a young age because I'd run out of things to wear before she'd ever start a load. My dad would see us on every other weekend and buy the things he noticed we'd need like new shoes and socks due to all the holes in our clothes. She made us wear Hanes or fruit of the loom sweatpants outfits each weekend to avoid sending real clothes to his house. He also, outside of the 1800, paid for our sports, school field trips, and took us on road trip vacations. She didn't contribute at all. When each of us aged out of child support, she either wanted a hefty rent or to kick us out. My rent for my bedroom was going to be $525, so I unfortunately moved out into my first apartment at 18 with a shitty bf.

I did the math....I did the research in the beginning. To file/do anything it would have cost me $125 to get the ball rolling.....and, after 7 years....he owes LESS than $6000 in back child support. My son is now 13. We struggled. And got zero help. \nLet's say we were granted that money through the courts and he paid it. But! A law of itemizing support money's is in place....would I be allowed to repair my car? Buy a new washer and dryer? Buy myself new workboots, as I do renovations for a living? Take my son on the vacation he always wanted, but I could not provide? Pay our cell phones, which is lifelines for friends, family, work/income? How do you decide what is OK?

Those checks kept coming, while I was fucking destitute. Then my little brother moved out before he turned 18 as well, and the checks *still* kept coming. Think he saw a dime of it? Probably not. \n\nMy father worked his entire child support paying life under the table to avoid having to pay my mom more than the minimum child support. Seeing as how she pretty much jumped from one man to the next to support her, and after the bs about where it was actually going in the first place, I can't say I blame him. We grew up solidly lower-middle class anyway.\n\nAnyway, as I was reading through these comments, the card idea came to me too. Thank you for writing that out there so nicely. The only thing I think the idea doesn't address is school field trips. Those are usually paid in cash, but I think it would totally be appropriate to have a card reader at each school to enable use of those cards to pay for field trips, school lunch bills, etc.",

It's about control,\" Family Court Judge Gerald Hardcastle told the couple. \"Because you folks can't solve it, it takes the services of a District Court judge, a bailiff and a court reporter.\"\n\n#\n\n> \"I'd just had enough,\" said Hardcastle, who has been a Family Court judge for seven years. \"We spend a lot of time dealing with some simply unreasonable issues. They are time-consuming, expensive issues. A lot of our calendar is made up of just this kind of nonsense.\n\n> \"So I told them to bring the Beanie Babies in, spread them out on the floor, and I'll have them pick one each until they're all gone.\" Hardcastle also invited reporters.\n\n> \"If you're not embarrassed to stand in front of a District Court Judge and ask to have your Beanie Babies divided, why should you be embarrassed for the press to be there?\" Hardcastle reasoned. \"Maybe they don't want their neighbors to know. But I still think there's something to be said for people being held accountable for their actions, and (Harold) filed this motion that takes up court time.\"",

Its not just about how much you spend on the child versus how much you receive. Defining what is a benefit to the child is the problem. Is paying your internet bill covered, fixing the water heater? Can you properly care for a child without a decent vehicle?

A young breeding pair is worth over $500, sometimes more for rarer strains.\n\nAnyway he had just had 3 of his breeding fish hatch out and had moved 75 fry to their grow out tank. They got to be about 2.5 inches long when he got in a fight with his girlfriend. She stormed out that and his roommate let her in the next day, while she poured bleach in all his tanks, making the PH skyrocket. The breeding pairs stopped breeding, and she killed what could have been $10,000 worth of young Discus. This was his main source of income. He filed a lawsuit, and the judge ruled it was frivolous because he just has a few fish die. Pisses me off to this day.\n\nHe's back to breeding now, quite a few of us pitched in a decent sum of money to help him get started again. It took 2 years to get new breeding pairs sorted out and for him to start making money.",
