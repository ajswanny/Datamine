I was baffled since I never took any steps to erase its presence, and also I was very active at the time. This was during the time that I learned basic HTML so I had several shitty Angelfire pages with the name all over them, and I'm sure more shitposting on forums than I have accomplished in my entire life since then. The best explanation I can think of is that I discontinued use of that name around 2001 or so, and the Internet is such a different place now that it must have vanished into the mists of the before time.\n\nedit: While I still haven't found my old username, despite helpful suggestions like archive.org and using Bing to get irrelevant and antiquated results, thinking about this *did* remind me of a website I used to spend a lot of time on, and to my surprise [it's still there](http://www.world-of-nintendo.com/), and essentially unchanged at that.\n\nI actually did find a review I posted on this site, under what I guess was a throwaway name, but I sadly can't point it out because I also linked it to my e-mail at the time which contained a reference to my real name and that's still visible on the site.",

    "body": "A freelance artist accidently came into possession of the Coca Cola empire. \n\nIn '98 or '99 an artist was pitching a new advertising campaign to Coca Cola. He had created and submitted concept art and things seemed to be progressing well. He was almost positive that he had landed the job until Coca Cola stopped taking his calls.  They didn't decline his services saying *\"Sorry, we want to go in a different direction\"*, they cut him off completely. The people that he had been working with refused to acknowledge that he existed. An odd way to lose a job. This would have been the end of the story, the artist would have taken his work and moved on to the next client but since Coca Cola refused to recognize his existence he couldn't retrieve his artwork. This led to a bit of legal wrangling and sleuthing where the artist discovered that Coca Cola had allowed their copyright to lapse (public record) and since he was the first person to create a tangible work with the Coca Cola name and logo he now owned the copyright (the multibillion dollar empire rests not on a secret recipe but a copyright). \n\nI'm not sure if it was exactly an ironclad loss, there may be provisions and/or precedents in copyright law to reconcile such situations but I think it was a sticky position that Coca Cola tried to avoid by sweeping it under the rug.\n\nI watched the whole story unfold on the artist's website (we would call it a blog today). The story stops at this point. I came back every year for several years looking for a conclusion until the site was taken down. I haven't been able to find any trace of the site or the story since.\n\n\n",

It was Paul Schaffer sitting down to make himself a sandwich. He looks at the table and realises he's got the PB but no J. He goes to get it, Letterman jumps into frame, shakes the PB up like a can of soda, and jumps back out of frame. When Paul gets back, he opens the PB and it blows all over his face.\n\n\nI saw it on TV, and have never been able to find it since. Although, in my extensive searching, i did come across a great story about how the squib in the peanut butter nearly killed Paul.",

He brought on an MIT professor to figure out how to make his ring spin on his desk longer and set a world record.  The anticipation each time he does it, the quirky MIT's different suggestions that he literally brought equations in to prove, it was all amazing.

After a few mins, Oprah can't restrain herself any longer and picks them up WITHOUT gloves on. She then TAPPED them together a la Dorothy! At this point of the story, my whole class gasped. Supposedly, the curator had a momentary look of horror on his face. This was all caught on film and I believed aired. Well the museum field gave her a lot of shit for her actions, so the Oprah show \"fixers\" proceeded to remove any evidence of this clip on the internet.

But the fun part was just browsing the ftp server. Interesting pages, pictures, random zip files.

It's how people shared files (no one talked about it much, but we shared so much music back then since you could just select a folder to share with your friends if you were online).  Away messages were carefully curated pieces of art (aka Linkin Park lyrics) and you actually had to tell people when you were available to chat or not unlike messaging today.\n\nI sorta miss that world, but I also love where we are technologically today.",

This video has probably cumulated more views in an hour than we ever did over several years.

    "body": "When I was 14 I was really into roleplaying in msn chatrooms, it was kind of a text based version of games like vampire the masqurade coupled with D&D, you had a profile/character sheet and used /me to describe what you were doing, a whole lot of political drama played out. \n\nAnyway someone I knew back then, this was 2004-5 started writing out what we did in book format so if I missed 2-3 days I could read her daily chapters, it was both like a newsletter and a colab fic. \n\nThe webside was called Something...Seneca... Wolfmother something and due to things in my life I had to move, then I didn't have internet at our house for about 6 months, I used to download and print out the chapter at the libraries and pay for 30 minutes at a cafe every week to basically enter The Tavern and say hi to people for a bit. \n\nThen the rooms closed, I don't remember exactly when and Seneca said she'd write a conclusion to the stories based on what we wanted to happen. I used to go back and read those every few months, but the link was so obscure I basically had it bookmarked and coped into word documents etc. \n\n\nI lost it. Completely. \n\nSomewhere out there on the internet there's a 4 book length story about the adventures of my Vampire Avatar and a bunch of other people but I've not been able to find it for at least 9 years. And I never found out what happened to my character at the end of it all. \n\nI had Seneca on MSN, but she stopped logging on and now that's gone too, I have no idea what her real name is and she was older than me and in America. So, you know, if you happen to know a early 30s native america woman who lived in NY mid 00s and moved somewhere south in 06ish and wrote literally 750k words of vampire fantasy fic based of msn chat...hmu.
