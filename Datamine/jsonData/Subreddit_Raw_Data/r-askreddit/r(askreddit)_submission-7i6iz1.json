These are examples they give of stranding requiring strong forms:\n\n>a. Who did you give it [to __ ]?\n\n>b. We\u2019ll help you if we [can __].\n\n>c. They want me to resign, but I don\u2019t intend [to __].\n\n>In each of these cases, the word in the brackets has a weak form, but it cannot be used in this context because its object has been stranded. Of course, in written English, there is no difference between weak and strong forms\u2014it\u2019s only a spoken difference\u2014but clitics are distinguished in written English, and the restriction on weak forms also extends to clitics. (There are additional restrictions on clitics, but they are not relevant to this discussion).\n\n>So, thus we can say that the second is in the sentence It is what it [is __] cannot be reduced to either a weak form or to a clitic because of the restriction to strong forms in cases of syntactic stranding.\n\nedit: Since I'm apparently still getting comments two days later, I didn't write that comment from english.stackexchange.com. Also, English does have rules and patterns, if it didn't, nobody would be able to reasonably learn it as a second language. http://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-37285796 (word order)",
