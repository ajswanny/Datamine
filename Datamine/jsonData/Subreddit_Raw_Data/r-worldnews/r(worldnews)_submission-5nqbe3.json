So many, in fact, that they seem to invite workers to spend hours at their desks writing extended articles about how they should be working less.

With advances in technology, the 15 hour week is entirely possible \u2013 as our material needs are met.

    "body": "I have always told my directs that they should be about 80% committed in their schedules for project work. That leaves 20% for fires or other issues. It also means when someone's on vacation that the team doesn't fall apart or get unnecessarily burdened. People need to have that regular pattern so that when it's time they can ramp up and meet any challenges. \n\nI had a direct that was, literally, working 70 hour weeks. I told her she had to stop. If she were to leave I would never be able to replace her. she needed to work a normal week and let the train wreck happen so that we could argue for more headcount. She did leave and the whole thing fell apart eventually but it DID force a rethink of how the role was managed.\n\nWhen you work more than your 40 or overcommit you are NOT doing your employer a favor you are setting them up for the big hurt when you're out sick, leave the team or quit the company. This culture needs to start at the top. People do what their boss does. \n\nI need you frosty each day/week/month. I want your best game. Like you said, if you can't get your work done in 40 hours (or less) then it's time to consider making changes (like more headcount or process improvement) or looking at your own workflow so that we can get you back to a normal level.\n\nDuring budget time, maybe EOY reconciliation, or whatever else may come up you'd better bet I'll put in my 50-80 hours when necessary but it's not going to be the standard.  \n\nI do answer emails (and take calls and texts) after hours and I do expect my team to do the same. If it's heavy and after hours and not an emergency...it can wait unless you and I have talked and we've made an exception. \n\nMore important to me is responsiveness (within 4 hours during the work day and within 1 day outside of work hours unless you're OOO then the rules change a little.) \n\nOh, and having your week booked solid with meetings? No. You do me no good as an employee or as a leader if I literally can't get time with you. If you are triple booked your entire week then you may as well not be working. When I do get time with you (not \"you\" you of course)? You're multitasking...thinking about something else...anxious to get to the next thing I feel like I'm just a disruption. Heaven forbid that I actually need you for an approval. \n\nSo, for me, the perfect mix is 4 days in the office and work from home one day (a light day). You're available and can work if necessary, take calls, answer emails, but otherwise relax and take care of your family.\n\nSo...good on you for setting the right example!",

I wish the USA would consider some of the professional advancements taking place in Sweden. Many companies over there do the following daily work schedule: Work 8 am - 11 am, lunch 11 am - 12 pm, work 12 pm - 3 pm and then call it a day. Yes, they are trying to transfer over to 6 hour work days instead of 8 hour work days and so far the studies have shown that those companies have been more productive than ever. Happier employees means they are more likely to be motivated to efficiently contribute to the firm. ",

A long time ago people who worked in the city lived in the city. Then suburbs came into existence. As the growing middle class moved out of the city to own their own land the urban sprawl expanded to such a degree that newer housing is situated very long way away from the city. Work never moved to the suburbs to join the new middle class, so people had to commute from the suburbs to the city.\n\nAs you mentioned, cities have stopped being places where the urban poor and working class live and are now rich play pens for the upper middle class and above. Without sufficient housing, lower middle class and working class people are having to move further away. Cities were not designed for this, as such the means of travel are often very inefficient. \n\nThe solution is affordable compact housing in city areas, along with large investments in public transport to minimise the amount of traffic. Due to Western housing prices being insane at the moment and public infrastructure being a political nightmare this is very challenging.",

They will appreciate it and commend you on it in a patronizing way, like they are watching a small child tie his shoelaces for the first time. The fact is, that if you have white skin, some Japanese will act like they don't understand you no matter how perfect your speaking is - this happens to my uncle who studied in Japan for 15 years, and has a doctorate in Japanese language from Stanford, and is now a professor of Japanese at UC - my Japanese wife confirms that his Japanese is definitely spoken better than the average Japanese person, but that doesn't matter to most Japanese because all they see is a foul-smelling, dirty, hairy, white beast (when I met one of my wife's grandma's she literally said \"Wow, he doesn't even smell bad.

This assumes of course that the labor doesn't require a high amount of specialization though. \n\nFrom studies of efficiency, what we should really be doing is moving towards 30 hour work weeks. However, there are some highly skilled jobs where there isn't enough available labor to step in because the skill demands are insane. Many medical health professionals have long hours and it's practically impossible to meet the skill demand without draining highly skilled workers from some other area. \n\nTo be able to support that kind of system requires an exceptionally good education system and perhaps a society that isn't remorseful about tossing out the complete idiots that can't hope to contribute to it. Neither of those appear to be things you can just vote for or that can magically be created by government mandate. ",

My wife works 35 at her employer and it is also considered full time. \n\nIt's actually pretty confusing because we have like 5 or more different classifications of employees, some are full time at 37.5 hours and some at 40 hours. When posting new positions we have to specify which full time schedule they will have. We also give overtime to eligible employees based on which schedule they have. I get overtime after 37.5 and others not until 40. And for salaried workers who are part time, what their full time schedule would be depends on what percentage of their FTE salary they get. A salaried worker working 30 hours gets 80% of their salary if it is a 37.5 hour position but 75% if it is a 40 hour position. ",

And my free time? Well, I play video games, most of which I can pause or quit at any time, with my phone on my desk. If it's midnight, and it rings, I'll answer it. If the problem is serious enough, I'll stop what I'm doing and work on it right then. If the problem's interesting/serious enough, I'll even do it on the weekend or holiday - serious or interesting to me, means that the downtime is costly to the client, and they're super happy to pay the holiday/weekend rate to have the issue corrected.\n\nBit of a wall of text there, but just another perspective on the \"working long hours\" from a support engineer, the doctor of the IT world.",
