A major part of the Paradise Papers comprises leaked files from company 'Appleby'.\n\nThe files reveal data of over 25,000 companies owned by individuals from 180 countries, from 1950 to 2016.\n\nBelow is a comparison of Paradise Papers with Panama Papers:\n\n----\n\n**Number of politicians and public officials**\n\n* Paradise Papers: 127 politicians and public officials (14 current or former country leaders included) from more than 47 countries\n\n* Panama Papers: 140 politicians and public officials from more than 50 countries\n\n----\n\n**Which leak is the bigger than other?**\n\nParadise Papers is bigger in number of records (13.5 million in Paradise Papers vs. 11.5 million in Panama Papers) and Panama Papers is bigger in terms of size of the leak (1.4 Tb in Paradise Papers vs. 2.6 Tb in Panama Papers).\n\nDue to that, I would recommend to say \"one of the biggest leaks in the history of journalism\" instead of the biggest and then you could compare some of the different figures related to the data size between Paradise Papers and previous leaks.\n\n----\n\n**Journalists in Paradise Papers project**\n\nMedia partners, countries, journalists\n\n* Number of journalists 381\n\n* Number of media partners 96\n\n* Number of countries 67\n\nIf you just consider the number of journalists, yes. There are more journalists working on the Paradise Papers than the Panama Papers at the time of the project release (381 Paradise Papers - 376 Panama Papers).\n\nAs for the number of media partners and number of countries, there are a few less. Panama Papers had 100+ media partners and 76 countries. The ICIJ currently has for Paradise Papers 96 media partners and 67 countries.",

Take the USA as example, they seemingly destroyed Swiss Banking Secrecy in Switzerland and eliminated Switzerland as a tax heaven by applying pressure on Swiss Banks through their branches in the USA. Now on the same time, Florida is the biggest Private Banking Hub in the world, the gateway to South America, maintaining as strict Banking Secrecy laws as Switzerland did. Not only that, but you also have states that are considered tax heavens, i.e. Delaware is the most renown one there, but there are so many more.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_as_a_tax_haven\n\n>\"The United States, which has for decades hosted vast stocks of financial and other wealth under conditions of considerable secrecy, has moved up from sixth to third place in our index. It is more of a cause for concern than any other individual country \u2013 because of both the size of its offshore sector, and also its rather recalcitrant attitude to international co-operation and reform. Though the U.S. has been a pioneer in defending itself from foreign secrecy jurisdictions, aggressively taking on the Swiss banking establishment and setting up its technically quite strong Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) \u2013 it provides little information in return to other countries, making it a formidable, harmful and irresponsible secrecy jurisdiction at both the Federal and state levels.\" Tax Justice Network",

This is a state where economic and political resources are made available not by the rule of law but by privileges granted from above. Politically, it rests on a system that predates and survives the Soviet period. As Henry Hale, an American political scientist, explains in a recent article, these informal networks and personal connections take precedence over formal rules and institutions. In the 1990s these networks jostled for influence; in the 2000s they were integrated into a single pyramid with Mr Putin at the top as the chief patron.\n\nThe weakness of property rights and the rule of law are not accidental shortcomings, but necessary elements of this personalised system. The legitimacy of ownership or office can be provided only by the patron. The patron-client relationship cannot be imposed on a society, but requires its consent, which in turn depends on the popularity of the chief patron. Kirill Rogov, a political analyst, argues that Mr Putin appears both as a defender of his people against a greedy and predatory elite, and the defender of the elite against a possible popular uprising.\"\n\n[Source](https://www.economist.com/news/briefing/21730644-ignoring-its-lessons-dangerous-russia-vladimir-putin-wants-forget-revolution)",

All of a sudden you'll find yourself being harassed by building inspectors, safety inspectors, tax audits, etc., because the power of bureaucracy in Russia is intense.  \n\nBy contrast in the U.S., the corporations and other large businesses just get their pet monkeys in congress and the state legislatures to add regulations that make it expensive for small businesses to stay in compliance with, but which add very little additional burden to large businesses.

After turning down an appearance on Yiannopoulos\u2019s podcast in May 2016 (Thiel: \u201cLet\u2019s just get coffee and take things from there\u201d), Thiel invited the Breitbart tech editor for dinner at his Hollywood Hills home in June, a dinner Yiannopoulos boasted of the same night to Bannon: \u201cYou two should meet. \u2026 An obvious candidate for movie financing if we got external. \u2026 He has fucked [Gawker Media founder Nick] Denton & Gawker so many ways it brought a tear to my eye.\u201d They made plans to meet during the July Republican National Convention. But much of Yiannopoulos\u2019s knowledge of Thiel seemed to come secondhand from other right-wing activists, as well as Curtis Yarvin, the blogger who advocates the return of feudalism. In an email exchange shortly after the election, Yarvin told Yiannopoulos that he had been \u201ccoaching Thiel.\u201d\n> \n> \u201cPeter needs guidance on politics for sure,\u201d Yiannopoulos responded.\n> \n> \u201cLess than you might think!\u201d Yarvin wrote back. \u201cI watched the election at his house, I think my hangover lasted into Tuesday.

    "body": "There\u2019s nothing illegal about establishing an offshore account unless you do it with the intent of tax evasion. There are actual legitimate reasons why an individual would want an offshore account, from investment to diversification of assets. A lot of the individuals that the Panama Papers exposed as having offshore accounts had perfectly good reasons for having them. The Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) requires banks around the world to report balances and any activity of American citizens to the IRS or face fines.\n\nHowever if the corporation or individual is specifically using offshore shell companies to avoid taxation on earnings that were earned within another country, that's another issue. Unfortunately the tax codes of most Western nations is so complex that there are endless transfer pricing loopholes to exploit.\n\nJapan provides a good example of what can be done, it has a law called the [Tax Haven Counter Measure Law](http://www.financialsecrecyindex.com/PDF/Japan.pdf). It applies to any Japanese subsidiary in a low tax jurisdiction with a tax rate of 20% or less. Under this law, the Japanese parent is taxed on the undistributed earnings of these foreign subsidiaries. \n\nIn this way, Japanese companies cannot set up subsidiary companies to hold copyrights, patents, leases, etc, in tax haven countries that then lease these back to the parant company for a fee and thereby lower their taxable profits in Japan. \n\nJapan also has the concept of \"Economic Logic\" which is often used to deny special treatment to companies in tax havens. Under this concept, if the businesses could reasonably be carried on in Japan, the 'economic logic' of them being offshore is lacking, and is hence denied. \n\nThere are a few exceptions made. For example, where the subsidiary is in a country where the tax rate is more than 20%, the earnings can be excluded from current taxation only if: \n\n(i) the company has staff, assets, and premises to conduct the business, \n\n(ii) the management, control, and governance is carried out in that country, and \n\n(iii) the transactions with related parties are less than 50% of all transactions. \n\nThis approach effectively prohibits shell companies while allowing corporations to still set up legitimate businesses even in countries with lower corporate tax rates.\n\nJapanese multinational corporations are prevented quite effectively from the use of tax havens by having a very simple law which was first enacted in the late 70's. Yet Japanese companies are able to compete globally. China treats its multinational corporations in a similar way. ",

I'm not saying there's a conspiracy theory here at all, but there is no way to be sure that they can't jail US citizens due to the nature of secret court proceedings.\n\nI guess what I'm trying to say is:\n\nU.S. Citizens are (theoretically) the oversight of a trial at its core. They ensure all parties are granted their day in court and receive a fair trial.\n\nWith secret trials, the oversight is the judge and maybe a few others. One could also make the assumption that the participants of the trial are also under a gag order of sorts as well, so they can't discuss details or even \"confirm or deny the existence\" of such a trial. If the accused is sentenced, it may be assumed that their sentencing is also secret. As such, we can't be sure that we have NOT imprisoned someone during secret court proceedings so long as they exist, because the don't have oversight that is representative of the people under the government.\n\nAgain, I'm not trying to be cynical. However, using the most basic ideas of a secret court and government, you can derive that it is possible in these cases. It is within reason to say that a government is more than capable of falsifying documentation, imprisonment, and so forth, in the interests of a select few.\n\nThis all makes me sad. \n\nFor anyone who who bothers reads this: Strive to be the best and most kind person you can be. Think as a person, not as a collective. Stand up for what is right, even if unpopular. Your seeds of dissent with sow thought in others, even if they disagree initially.",

It reported that anyone suspected of being involved in nuclear proliferation, espionage or cyber-attacks, according to the court, may be considered a legitimate target for warrantless surveillance. Acting like a parallel U.S. Supreme Court, the court greatly broadened the \"special-needs\" exception to do so.[2]\n\n>**The newspaper reported that in \"more than a dozen classified rulings, the nation's surveillance court has created a secret body of law giving the National Security Agency the power to amass vast collections of data on Americans\".[2][a]**",
