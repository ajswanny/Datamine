Reports like to emphasize the number of people killed, and the number who survived, like it's failure versus success.\n\nWhen I hear news about these events and they say \"XX dead, YY injured\" (or in this case 48 survived) I immediately imagine that the YY are going to be treated for a bit, and then playing frisbee in a few weeks, hanging out with friends, going to the movies. Whew, they dodged a bullet (figuratively or literally). This is great news. Great, great news. And the medical staffs should be very, very proud. \n\nWhen I *really* think about it, many of these people have life-altering injuries (in addition to possibly life-altering mental issues). There may be amputations, a lifetime of medical treatments, etc. \n\nNow perhaps I am too optimistic or am a simpleton, but it takes effort for me to remember that most of these survivors are still not going to be the same people they were physically or emotionally after this is all over. Including spouses, family members, etc, the number of people whose lives are altered by an attack like this is far greater than the initial stats suggest. ",

The surgeons, nurses and other medical professionals should be commended, of course, but as a blood bank laboratory scientist myself, many times we are also on the front lines (albeit behind the scenes) making sure blood products are ready when needed, that compatible blood products are given, and handling the massive pile of paperwork that comes from giving out uncrossmatched products to multiple people and keeping them all straight. I have done a few massive transfusion protocols in my time and they are high adrenaline and high stress for us, and all of the nurses and surgeons we come in contact with, but rarely do the scientists working hard behind the scenes (usually understaffed, also) get any recognition for their hard work and I am positive that with as many injuries as were sustained that the blood banks were working overtime! And to have all survive is a testament to the teamwork, competency, and dedication of all involved with those patients!\n\nPlease continue to donate blood products now, and every 56 days that you are eligible! It is so critical for the safety and well being of our communities! ",

With the terror attacks, necks and abdomens were targeted, with the attackers moving together, targeting people as a group. \n\nNot all hospitals in London are prepared for these wounds. Certain institutes are designated to receive major trauma, with four hospitals receiving, along with day to day casualties. Stress on the system came from the short time frame, receiving multiple wounded at once and the types of wounds.\n\nWe are lucky we have contingency planning for this and the good will of hospital staff coming in on such short notice.

Those numbers are overall averages and vary from country to country.\n\nSo if I want to rebuild an accident black spot and apply for federal money I must prove that my costs of the rebuilding is cheaper than the economic loss resulting from the accidents. \n\nThats why there are only 3 categories in the car crash statistics.

That includes people who have insurance, but can't afford the deductible.  In reality though, this simply means your country will have much worse health outcomes and will spend more in the long term.  Preventative care costs far less than emergency care or treatment of severe/late-stage illnesses. Also, it's cheaper to treat one person that is sick, than the ten people they infected because they didn't seek treatment when they needed it.  Also, fewer people seeking treatment means fewer people needing to be employed. The UK will be less healthy, with a more expensive health care system for your citizens, and higher unemployment numbers in the health sector.\n\nTake a look at us across the pond.

Charge a minimal co-pay for follow up visits for people with chronic diseases, as long as they went to their one freebie visit, and include the medicine and drugs they need to control those diseases (e.g. the blood pressure pills, cholesterol pills, etc.)  Or allow them to have online-only refill consults for only the cost of the drug.  (That's what Kaiser Permanente does now.)\n\nMANY chronic diseases can be controlled with minimal interaction with a medical professional, but right now even that access is priced far beyond what folks without insurance can handle - and even people with insurance won't bother because the co-pays and visits cost too much.  \n\nThe result is that they miss vital annual bloodwork tests, or have cancer start and miss having it caught early when it can be treated cheaply, or don't take the fairly inexpensive drugs to control a condition that worsens and worsens until they have a heart attack or develop diabetic gangrene or have stage IV lung cancer and need a lung transplant.\n\nAn ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.
