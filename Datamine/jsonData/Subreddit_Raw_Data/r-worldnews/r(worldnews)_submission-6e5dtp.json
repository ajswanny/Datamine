I'll just say as an anecdote, I supervised a guy who was on for child porn. When  arrested they located a shed out back that was filled with bdsm restraints for little hands and legs. But no known victims, so only the child porn charges stuck. Fast forward and I'm supervising him. Search his computer and locate tons of travel info and searches regarding Thailand and other SE Asia countries. He's searching about sex offender laws and such. I highly doubt he had any good intentions with his travel, but there was zero I could do when his supervision ran up other than advise the sheriff's office. I think on a case by case basis this is a smart law and wish we had something similar. \n\nEdit: I guess I should clarify if anyone else sees this, I am a fed officer in the United States, not Australia.

The law for underage sex in Vic is set such that if you get a conviction, you *are* creepy and should be kept away from children, so this ban makes sense there. Most states have some rule that if the two kids are within 2 or 3 years of each other, and consenting, and both able to say \"No\", then it isn't criminal. Other states don't have such exemptions, and 16 year olds get records as pedophiles, no jobs, and now travel bans.\n\n[Details](https://aifs.gov.au/cfca/publications/age-consent-laws)",

    "body": "This is scary, but what's scarier is the amount of people who are applauding it.   I'm assuming it's \"because of pedophiles\"... and you know pedophiles are inhuman monsters who can neither be trusted or allowed the basic freedoms allowed to other people. \n\n\"But they committed a crime.\"  Correct, and then I'm assuming they have paid for their crime that you has been proven in a court of law with time in jail (if applicable) or probation (if applicable).  Once that is over, the government has NO right to restrict a person's freedoms.  If someone said \"We should keep in jail for an extra year after their prison sentence is up\"  I hope most people would raise an eyebrow to that.  We already restrict where they live. \n\nSo here's the problem.  If you restrict the rights of a person (it's called Freedom of Movement) that person is no longer your citizen but now your prisoner.  I won't mention other countries that do this, but almost all of them are not the type of country you want to emulate.  If you want an ultimately free society, Freedom of Movement is just as important as everything else. (And as an American, I keep trying to bring awareness to the fact that the no-fly list, TSA, and a number of other moves the government away has infringed on this right) \n\n\"But what about the children.\"  Oh of course the cry of those who want to do good but ultimately do evil.   If you think these men are a danger, then they shouldn't be free.  If you have no proof these men are a danger, their rights should not be restricted.  \n\nConsider that you have a political dissident and you find a way to mark him as a pedophile or something else equally disliked (terrorist).  You now have complete control of him if you allow the restriction of this fundamental right. \n\nListen, you can restrict someone from being in your country, and I'll support that. That's what immigration controls are for.  What I won't allow is a country that restricts the method of movement around itself (no fly lists) or restricts a citizen or visitor from leaving it if they chose.  There's obvious limitations (conviction of a crime) but the right of a citizen to leave one's country should always be available. ",

The Australian RWNJ Government can not pass laws in the Senate because the independents hold the balance of power - this is a favourite hobby horse of Australias Rush Limbaugh analog.

What is banned is depicting a minor in sexually explicit material, and \"breast size\" is just one of the factors that are used to determine whether or not something fits into that category.  The same actress could be banned in one film and not another, because in one film she was playing a role that depicted the character as underage.\n\nNot only is it illegal for pornographic material to depict an actress as under aged (regardless of her actual age), but the actress doesn't even have to be a real person.  Even cartoons and animations are banned!  Not sure if this extends to non-visual media but it honestly wouldn't surprise me.\n\nI don't think materials in violation are technically illegal to possess, or classified as child exploitation material, but they're refused classification and therefore cannot be published or distributed etc.",

So, if someone wants money for drugs and steals, it was a crime of opportunity and there's a very real possibility that they can be rehabilitated, do their time and never do it again.  Pedophiles, on the other hand, will always have a compulsion to harm children.  You can't 'do your time' as a pedo then be done with it.

    "body": "There are myriad reasons.\n\nIn Cambodia, the government is unbelievably corrupt. It's *technically* a constitutional monarchy, but it's actually a mafiocracy. \n\nThis is no exaggeration. Imagine what the U.S. would look like if the Gambino crime family or the Russian mob (I know, I know) actually ran the show. \n\nThe current prime minister, who strong-armed his way into power after the 1970s genocide and decades of civil war, has ruled for his own benefit, developing the country only enough to line his (and his cronies') pockets and pacify the masses.\n\nMuch of the commercial exploitation of children runs with protection from \u2014 or even direct collusion with \u2014 corrupt government officials.\n\nSocial services infrastructure is very weak. There are regulatory bodies and a lot of NGOs, but basically few social workers or child protection officers: no government foster care system, no \"children's services,\" pretty much nothing. Lots of kids fall through the cracks.\n\nAlso, there's sheer economic desperation among the poorest communities. Families with no access to healthcare, birth control, education or employment often are forced to send their children away to other cities or even neighboring countries to work. Once the kids are away from their communities, anything can happen. Also, many victims of sexual exploitation are undocumented immigrants from Vietnam. They have no legal status, no access to anything like due process. They can be bought and sold like meat.\n\nAdd to all of this the incredible sexual double standard: men are expected to have many sex partners. The vast majority of Cambodian men visit prostitutes. Women, however, are expected to be chaste, modest, shy and even ignorant about sex. It's still not acceptable for couples who are dating or even engaged to have sex, so there's a huge market for illicit sex.\n\nAs someone told me a while back, \"It's easier \u2014 and cheaper \u2014 to get a blow job in Phnom Penh than it is to get a hamburger.\"\n\nSo if you are a rich westerner \u2014 and all westerners are rich compared to the average Cambodian worker \u2014 and you want to have sex with a child in Cambodia, your money will find plenty of takers. And unless you happen to be caught by a foreign NGO or run accidentally afoul of some corrupt, mobbed-up government official, you're unlikely to face consequences.\n\nIn Thailand, which is a much wealthier country, there are still pockets of extreme poverty. The hill tribes (roughly analogous to First Peoples in North America) are desperately poor and perennially victimized. Because their tribal groups are transnational, existing in Thailand, Myanmar, Laos, Vietnam and Cambodia, it's very easy for the Thai government to decide that any individual hill tribe person (who is highly unlikely to have a birth certificate or any citizenship documents) is an illegal immigrant. This strips them of any rights and makes them extremely vulnerable to exploitation.\n\n",

In Sweden, a guy working as a manga translator for years was prosecuted for CP posession after police found that a handful of the thousands of mangas he had worked on was questionable. Last I heard he had appealed to the supreme court. And, yes, they literally have \"experts\" come in court and give their opinions on the depicted age of the drawings.\n\nBlanket laws like this are a big problem and an indication of a police state. When the law reaches too widely, everyone's breaking it, and the only thing seperating who's a criminal and not is where the police decides to draw the line. I know I won't be considered a criminal for going down to the local library and renting Anne Frank's Diary, but it feels fucking bad knowing that I'm technically breaking CP law doing so (the book describes a child's exploration with her genitals).",
