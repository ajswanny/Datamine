Look back not so long ago, and you'll remember the carving out of Crimea, and the feints / references to former Soviet assets like Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania as being essentially \"illegitimately\" independent. Before that, the fun in poor Georgia.\n\nThe most logical path for Putin to take, is to court and placate Trump (and through him, the United States), while using those gains to dissuade the United States from interfering with further pressure on Ukraine or the other nations I mentioned. He believes (perhaps rightfully so) that Trump would prefer positive publicity and peaceful gains with Russia, and value those above the integrity of Ukraine and NATO. At this point in contemporary history, NATO is in danger of becoming a bluff; once it's called, it will be useless.\n\nFactor in the uncertainty hovering around North Korea, South Korea, and Japan, and we have a two-front problem that Putin is intensely aware of. Trump's already vocalized insane thoughts about how Japan needs to build its military back up, and even create nukes itself. Never mind the fact that Japan went from an Allied power to a genocidal imperialistic war machine in the span of less than 3 decades, telling South Korea and Japan \"You guys are on your own with that crazy shit up north\" is a terrible decision.\n\nI can't help but realize that with Brexit and Trump, the UK and US have dealt themselves a pair of bitch-slaps that upset the balance of power and will lessen our allied standing on the world stage.",

Yes there are NATO troops on Russia border already but they are limited due to various agreements. Also Crimea had naval base.\n\nRussia don't want nuclear exchange and logic of MAD says that if anti-missile system is being build then Russia should strike just before it happens.\n\nAlso anti- missiles need to be close to border of Russia because anti-missiles can intercept rockets only on start.\n\nSo Russia annexes Ukraine and making sure Ukraine has a territorial dispute with Russia therefore not being able to join NATO and host anti-missiles.\n\nYes sanctions and Cold War 2.0.

That's only according to my sources, which admittedly are not particularly vast. \n\nAlso, I'm pretty sure Qatar and the UAE have taken a stance on involvement directly related to ISIL, and not so much about Syrian liberation specifically. \n\nKeep in mind that apparently Turkey is also \"on our side\" in the conflict but is also funneling money, resources, and safe spaces to ISIL operations at the same time. So the Gulf states are having to posture themselves against ISIL to be militarily involved, but are also technically sharing the same side in the larger conflict with Turkey, who is sheltering the very target they are setting out to eliminate. \n\nWorld politics are fucking complicated. Concessions have to be made. Compromises. Negotiations. Sometimes you have to ally yourself with entities you might otherwise dislike or disagree with. It's a delicate chess game with many competing interests involved, with lives and entire nations at stake. \n\nThen there's the whole business about the pipeline, which ties into European politics, and our relationship with Russia.\n\nEveryone love to demonize the Middle East but have no concept of global Politics.

    "body": "More than that. For the past 70 years the U.S. military has been the default military around the world. There have been a lot of cons that come with that, but one pro is that countries in NATO, for instance, have largely been able to get away without large militaries. \n\nAside from the UK and Canada, most NATO countries don't have the militaries one might expect given their populations and economies, because it's assumed that if any of them were attacked the U.S. overbearing military might would crush the attacker. This also applied to countries not in NATO, but in whose conflicts the U.S. has taken a concrete side.\n\nThe world has seen an unparalleled level of peace in general, and international peace in the last 7 decades, as war between countries has almost completely disappeared (excepting some outliers and the ones the U.S. is involved in). If the U.S. position on conflicts around the world or its commitment to defending it's interests are put into question, a lot of possibilities open up.\n\nWe've already seen that happen in Ukraine, where Putin wagered that the U.S. wouldn't stop him from seizing Crimea, and Syria, where Assad has used chemical weapons and violated the Geneva Convention, and in so doing destroyed the secular sects of the rebellion, leaving only a faltering ISIS to fight him.\n\nThe U.S. spends way more on its military than is in its best interest, but in so doing it helps make the world prosperous. The U.S. navy, for instance, is the de facto force against piracy on the open seas. Absent the U.S. filling that role, countries around the world aren't going to be able to spend as little on defense as they do now, and world prosperity is likely to decrease.",

The first is unique to the civilization and shown in the diplomacy window. For example, Egypt likes powerful military allies and America likes peace on their home continent. The second is randomly selected and hidden. You can use spies, diplomacy, and other tools to uncover this hidden agenda. The AI attempts to follow these agendas throughout the game.\n\nAfter playing several games, I feel the AI is a lot less random and the game now revolves around a set of competing Agendas.",

If Russia is allowed to expand it won't just upset the EU, it will make us and by extension our President look weak. It's entirely possible that he will demand that Russia stop its push to restore the Soviet bloc in exchange for removing the missile shield and restoring normal diplomacy. Even from a strategic standpoint, if Russia reclaims former levels of power they could team up with China and pose a serious threat to the US, it's in everyone's self interest not to let Russia run wild.\n\nPresidential candidates have a history of talking a big game to get elected, especially people who are as clueless as Trump. But once they're in power and they learn what our goals and motivations are, not to mention the sudden responsibility of being held personally accountable for what happens by hundreds of future generations all around the globe, they tend to change their tune. Just look at Obama, he had grand and optimistic plans for reducing the military and increasing transparency, right up until he got into office, learned how the world actually works, and did the exact opposite.",
