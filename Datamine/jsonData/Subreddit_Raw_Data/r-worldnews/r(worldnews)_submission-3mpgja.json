It is a particular temperature and pressure where water is between all 3 phases.  If you leave this point, either with a different temperature or different pressure, water can still be between 2 phases, like liquid or solid, or gas or solid.\n\nIf you look at that plot, you'll note that for low pressures, water can no longer be liquid.  A phase change merely goes from solid to gas.\n\nPure water under Martian conditions (-23 C, 0.01 atm on a good day/good location) cannot exist.\n\nHOWEVER, dissolved salts can shift the triple point of water.  Perchlorates, which have been shown to be abundant on Mars, can greatly move this triple point such that under ideal circumstances, liquid water can be stable on Mars.  This has been shown in scientific papers before this year, but not to this scale.  I believe in one case, there were frozen droplets on a lander (Pheonix?) leg that were shown to have melted and dripped.\n\nIt is still a surprise that all of these things have come together...the right mix of perchlorates, warm enough temp, and high enough pressure, but there we have it.\n  ",

If you were to add any more water vapor, it will would into a liquid because the air can't \"hold\" any more water vapor. Changing the temperature changes the maximum amount of water vapor that can exist. At lower temps, the air can \"hold\" less water.\n\nTechnically air doesn't \"hold\" water, but this an extremely simplified way of looking at it and hopefully that makes sense.\n\nI will come back a little later and explain this in more detail.",

When a journalist asked how likely they think life is on Mars with this new announcement, the NASA guys sidestepped, but the French scientist outright said that he thinks and has always believed that it's highly likely that there's microbial life on Mars, even if it's sub-surface.\n\nThe thing that he pointed out that has swayed my opinion as well, is that we know for a fact that chunks of Earth have became meteorites that have landed on Mars (just as Martian rocks, etc have been blasted onto Earth in the past as well). Considering that we've had life on Earth for billions of years and some microbes can survive significant trips through space, some may have hitched a ride over there ages ago and are still thriving in some environment.",
