The reality is that people will need to make sacrifices that they will never benefit from.\n\nI agree with Hawking, but have serious doubts that we will ever be able to actually make forward progress towards this goal on a meaningful enough timeline before local variables wipe us out (climate change, war, famine, water shortages, viral outbreaks).",

As it stands people on this planet are divided by, to be perfectly honest, rather unimportant things, from an entirely pragmatic point of view. New horizons bring a growth in awareness throughout a population of just how beneficial it can be for everyone to profit. It's happened before on smaller scales, and WILL happen again on larger scales, the most likely of those being spacefaring, hence Mr Hawking pushing that particular pathway as the one he advocates most. It's really more of a study in psychology and anthropology than anything about science or economics.",

Things like the civil rights movement, women's rights, and even over the last few decades the heightened consciousness towards how we protect our planet. \n\nThere will always be those who are greedy and turn to negative actions in order to further their own goals, but ultimately the field on which they play is determined by the people, not the player. We are the ones who tend the grass, paint the lines, maintain the nets and kick the ball. We are the ones who cheer, who watch on TVs built by more of us. They are the ones who sit atop the tall towers, worried about the outcome of the game not because they care who wins in the abstract, but because they know that the team they own winning means increased probability of future returns for them. \n\nFor a paradigm shift to happen, to reach the tipping point and re-engage the masses into space exploration, there needs to be something truly inspiring taking place. As impressive as it may be to meet an astronaut today, most people don't necessarily think too highly of them beyond that interaction. There aren't posters of astronauts who visit the ISS on the walls of children's bedrooms. There aren't parades in major cities showcasing the astronauts who go up there. Why? Because it has become routine for us. Boring. It's the same thing. We don't even know why they go up there any more, what good does any of it do?\n\nLanding humans on Mars, building space stations orbiting the other planets, landing on Europa or Titan... These things are not common. Building cities on other planets... This is something that would reignite the flame of adventure in the heart of mankind, and I truly believe that. \n\n[I'll leave you with this video, with words from my favourite human ever, Carl Sagan, and some absolutely beautiful imagery.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwXqoaThGvA) ",

There's nothing [habitable] out there for millions of miles.\n\ne: It's kinda like how people gain perspective when they travel. Even staying in your hometown, irrespective of how big it is, it's hard to really gain new perspective when you see the same things over and over. But the minute you go out and see a world you haven't ever seen before with your own eyes, it's an entirely different experience, one that puts your existence, and the existence of other's, into perspective.",

He is the master of mankind by the will of the gods and master of a million worlds by the might of His inexhaustible armies. He is a rotting carcass writhing invisibly with power from the Dark Age of Technology. He is the Carrion Lord of the vast Imperium of Man for whom a thousand souls are sacrificed every day so that He may never truly die.\n\nYet even in His deathless state, the Emperor continues His eternal vigilance. Mighty battlefleets cross the daemon-infested miasma of the Warp, the only route between distant stars, their way lit by the Astronomican, the psychic manifestation of the Emperor's will. Vast armies give battle in His name on uncounted worlds. Greatest amongst His soldiers are the Adeptus Astartes, the Space Marines, bio-engineered super-warriors. Their comrades in arms are legion: the Imperial Guard and countless planetary defence forces, the ever-vigilant Inquisition and the Tech-priests of the Adeptus Mechanicus to name only a few. But for all their multitudes, they are barely enough to hold off the ever-present threat to humanity from aliens, heretics, mutants -- and far, far worse.\n\nTo be a man in such times is to be one amongst untold billions. It is to live in the cruelest and most bloody regime imaginable. These are the tales of those times. Forget the power of technology and science, for so much has been forgotten, never to be relearned. Forget the promise of progress and understanding, for in the grim dark future there is only war. There is no peace amongst the stars, only an eternity of carnage and slaughter, and the laughter of thirsting gods.\"",

His stubborn mindedness keeps the Imperium in conflict to protect mankind, while the actual men are pragmatically using chaos and the warp to work around the Emperor's sheer force of will and keep the thing ticking over. In doing so they make the Emperor more powerful thus increasing the pain.\n\nThe whole exercise is one of self-mutilation. Confronted with reality and finding our anchor - the Emperor - wrong has broken us. Eventually something has to give. Either they win and destroy *Chaos* through force of arms as the Emperor wants, or his light vanishes forever and he swallows his pride and takes his place with the thirsting gods.
