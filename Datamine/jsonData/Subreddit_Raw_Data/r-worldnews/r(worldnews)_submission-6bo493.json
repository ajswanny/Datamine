Due to then having diplomatic immunity they can not even be detained by the police for questioning due to being considered technical staff. \n[See the chart here. ](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomatic_immunity)\n\nThe cops aren't cowards they know the law and know they can't do any more than break up the fight and keep people separated. This is something that a DC cop can't handle and has to be handled by the state department. I'm pretty sure these guys have dealt with foreign diplomat details and thus know about the law more than someone online.\n\nEDIT: To everyone pointing out the foot note claiming it allows the officers to detain them for public safety, how would detaining them be any different than what they did? The officers were all attempting to stop the attack with one officer being seen using his asp to strike a body guard. Detaining the guards would not have accomplished anything more than just separating them and actively stopping any further attacks. The officers did the best they could given the political status of the attackers and any more could end up not with the officers being fire but the state department being in a worse situation now. At max the guards have their immunity revoked and asked to leave and that's the most the state department can do. This is a horrible thing to happen against American citizens on American soil, but unfortunately our hands are tied when it comes to what we can and can't do about it. I feel the officers handled it the best way they could short of causing more problems between the US and an ally/NATO member. ",

Fearing clashes between different Turkish groups, the mayor of Rotterdam banned the rally, the government revoked the landing rights for the plane of a Turkish minister who was supposed to speak at the rally.\n\nThe Turks insisted on holding the rally and speaking to Dutch-Turkish supporters in Rotterdam and sent the minister of a family affairs, who was in Germany at the time, to speak in Rotterdam. In the afternoon several Turkish convoys crossed the Dutch-German border, with one carrying the Turkish minister and the others serving as decoys for the Dutch police.\n\nDutch police at first stopped one of the decoy convoys, but just in time they realised another convoy was headed for the Turkish consulate in Rotterdam and blocked them in in an alley behind the consulate building.\n\nAt first a regular police unit supported by a small number of riot police blocked the alley leading to the consulate and requested she took the shortest route to Germany, with a police escort. [She refused and a stand-off ensued.](http://nos.nl/video/2162637-turkse-minister-stapt-uit.html)\n\nAt the same time several hundreds to a few thousand Turkish protesters gathered on the square in front of the consulate and [the situation became more serious](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59b-F_glt2I), as people from the consulate whipped up the protesters waving Turkish flags and chanting loudly.\n\nThe stand-off on both sides of the consulate, both between the Turkish guards and the police, and between the AK-party protesters and the riot-police, continued until well into the night. Eventually, [the riot police started to clear the square](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7Dpws2MQgU) when the protestors refused to leave and ignored an emergency law prohibiting the rally.\n\nAfter hours of the Turkish minister refusing to leave, it was decided the situation had taken long enough. However, physically detaining the guards and the minister was deemed too dangerous for regular police, as they could not rule out the guards' willingness to use violence. More importantly, it was also suspected that the guards carried fire arms.\n\n[So they called in the Special Intervention Unit](http://nos.nl/video/2162686-speciale-politie-eenheid-arriveert.html) and arrested the guards. The minister, however, locked herself in her armoured Mercedes and it wasn't until they threatened to cut open the car or deport her and the car to Germany whole, that she finally gave herself up. [She was put into another vehicle](https://twitter.com/NOS/status/840722134028627968/video/1), and along with her guards and cars, she was driven to the German border and deported.",

The article makes no mention that these were bodyguards or security personnel, only \"supporters\". \n\nFox News, of all places, is the only one that has it even remotely accurate and prominently displayed on the front page, with the headline \"Violent clash breaks out between Turkish president's bodyguards, protesters\", and the article accurately portrays the events. \n\nHowever, every single one of these sites had articles about onesies for men and a man suing his date for $17 for texting in a movie. Clearly topics of national importance. \n\nEdit: I missed NBC, NBC actually has a headline down the page \"Violence Flares at Turkish Ambassador\u2019s Residence in D.C.\", which is just a video of the incident with captions saying protesters were attacked by supporters.

Although they are in most cases immune from prosecution, they are not immune from arrest and temporary detainment for investigative purposes.\n\n\n**Edit:** This has gained a lot of attention and most people replying don't really understand the scope of the [different levels of immunity](http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/what-is-diplomatic-immunity.html) that the US provides to foreign representatives. [This publication](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/150546.pdf&ved=0ahUKEwi16aSxuPfTAhUCymMKHcZIAH0QFggsMAE&usg=AFQjCNESRpKPl2s_BXhCnKIBkusPxh3u0w&sig2=fKG0G-o5S_4F-1T5MwYfyQ) (PDF warning) from the US department of state explains the breakdown of different levels of immunity. Contrary to popular belief, not everyone foreign representative enjoys full diplomatic immunity. That level of essentially complete immunity from virtually any crime is only reserved for top level diplomats and heads of state. Most foreign agents fall into category 2 or 3. Category 2 is immunity for technical and adminstrative staff who provide essential services to the foreign diplomatic or counselor mission. These staff members enjoy legal immunity from actions performed in accordance with their official duties, however they are not protected from civil liability and their family members do not share any form of immunity like family members with diplomatic immunity would.\n\nFinally we have a third category of immunity. This is for members of the staff. People in this category would include people in roles such as security, cooking, cleaning, etc. Neither they nor their family members are afforded no personal inviolability, no inviolability of property, and no immunity from the obligation to serve as a witness to the courts. Essentially their protection from prosecution only extends so far as it immediately pertains to their ability to perform their job role, and even then it is somewhat limited. So to everyone saying these security guards enjoy complete diplomatic immunity from any interference by the police, you are absolutely wrong. So seeing as to how beating US citizens  who are exercising their 1st amendment right could not have  possibly been justified by any official diplomatic mission, the police had every right in this case to interfere and stop the senseless actions of these guards and even arrest them if charges are warranted.\n\n\nTL;DR These  security guards do not enjoy full diplomatic immunity and should be prosecuted to the full extent of the law.",

    "body": "to be fair to the police I'm sure they were confused, but that one in the white uniform looked like he was hitting a bodyguard (the guy in the brown shirt with a holstered gun, so I assume body guard) to get him off the person he was attacking. And the officer in the black looks like he's pushing some of the guys in suits who also look like security back. \n\nAlso around the 20 second mark when the body gaurd just casually kicks someone on the ground the shorter black officer with a blue helmet on yells at him to \"get over here\" and it looks like the guy bolts away. and near the start of the second video it looks like one of the officers in white pepper sprays one of the body guards. \n\nMy guess is the body guards went into the residence afterwards or the police were wearing about arresting them on the spot due to what you mention. Generally in these situations they would arrest everyone involved in the fight if they were going to detain someone.\n\nThe body guards can and more than likely will be expelled if it's found out who they are. \n",

The bodyguards do not have full diplomatic immunity. These staff, I believe, fall under the umbrella of \"functional immunity\" which essentially means that any crimes committed in the process of doing their jobs can not be prosecuted. \n\nIf these staffmembers had run into Kurdish protestors in a bar and fought there, they would be able to be prosecuted. However, since the encounter occurred during work, this would be protected by functional immunity.\n\nNow, this was kind of a shitshow. The US would not be overreacting to ask Turkey to waive immunity, but if Turkey refuses, the bodyguards in question will be declared *persona non grata* and be forced to leave the country within 24 hours or face prosecution.\n\nSource: [Department of State *Diplomatic and Consular Immunity: Guidance for Law Enforcement and Judicial Authorities*](https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/150546.pdf) pp. 6 & 20",

He had taken the children, ages 7, 9 and 10, as they played outside, and he later called his wife to tell her that he had the girls at an amusement park in Denver.\n\nMs. Gonzales conveyed the information to the police, but they failed to act before Mr. Gonzales arrived at the police station hours later, firing a gun, with the bodies of the girls in the back of his truck. The police killed him at the scene.\n\n",
