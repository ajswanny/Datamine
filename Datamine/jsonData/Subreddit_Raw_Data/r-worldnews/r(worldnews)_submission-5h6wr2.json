    "body": "That's a very bad example. Gravity is much easier to observe and predict due to celestial bodies only interacting through it. (If you don't assume dark energy and dark matter to be quirks of gravity). Climate change on the other hand is a mechanism within a chaotic system. New effects can pop up, others can be over or underestimated.\n\nEdit:\nFor those, who think, I'm disputing climate change, an answer to a comment from one of you:\n\nI'm not disputing the change of climate induced by man. I mentioned climate change being an effect in a chaotic system. Chaotic systems are characterized by smallest changes in initial conditions fundamentally changing the macroscopic behaviour. I'm disputing that computational models deployed to QUANTIFY this effect and extrapolate the climate into the future can be accurate as they are flawed by climate being a chaotic system. Gravity does not operate within a chaotic system. Interactions between its agents can be isolated and thus QUANTIFIED (earth's orbit around the sun etc.), while a thermometer can be rising due to multiple reasons.\n\nA better comparison would have been, disputing climate change is like disputing, that airplanes can fly. Both mechanisms operate in a chaotic system and can only be quantifiably understood by accounting for Turbulence via a model in the Navier Stokes equations, in the case of flying.\n\nEdit 2: Those pointing out, that celestial movements are also chaotic, as soon, as multiple bodies are involved: Of course that's true, the entire universe is a chaotic system. However, for the scope of the general public, most relevant questions regarding gravity can be approximated by collapsing it to a 2-body problem, which is non-chaotic (You're not evaluating the moon and the center of the galaxy, when you're calculating, how a dropping apple accelerates). For climate, you have to do that. So comparing it to gravity removes the complexity of the matter for the understanding, that the general public has. And the general public are the ones, they are trying to convince here. Hence, in my opinion, this comparison is misleading.\n\n",

Mr Pruitt has said the science behind climate change is \u201csubject to considerable debate\u201d (which I personally don't believe is a controversial statement)\n2. [He] regularly conspired with the fossil fuel industry to attack EPA protections. (I'm willing to believe this, but they don't really give any details. Kind of lame)\n\nThe rest is basically just climate change copypasta.\n\nEDIT: I completely agree on the \"Climate change denier\" too. I am skeptical, not necessarily of the science, but of politicians who might see this as an opportunity to extend their reach. But people have called me a denier. There was another thread a month or two ago, where I was merely trying to explain why people might be skeptical, and even this got me labeled a denier. In that thread I didn't even say what I thought personally!",

    "body": "Not really. The big change started happening long after the industrial revolution, around 1900 or so. Since then, the rate has been mostly increasing. The industrial revolution is usually something described as happened in a few locations in the world and mostly much earlier. But if your point is that CO2 levels are increasing with the spread of industrialization, then I agree.\n\nEdit: Ok then, sources.\n\nhttp://cdiac.ornl.gov/trends/co2/lawdome-graphics.html\nin particular: http://cdiac.ornl.gov/trends/co2/graphics/lawdome.smooth75.gif\n\nSo if you look att the CO2 levels here, it might at first seem like it was incrasing as early as 1750. But look over the whole thousand year period. You will see that the levels around 1850 are not really that extreme, at most slightly above the peaks of the last 1000 years. In other words, that might be natural. 1850 is late or ending industrial revolution. By 1900 or so, the wavy changes goes away, from there it's just a linear increase to what we have today. The graph sadly does not show how we the last 16 years are getting even faster increase, but you get the picture.",

Right now the developing world is dependent on fossil fuels for growth.  They have far less capability of harnessing renewables, more dependency on non-renewables, and less ability to regulate.  If you actually got serious about enforcing a transition to renewables globally, you would create an imbalance in which developing nations either get shit on for using non-renewables, or they get away with it and gain a competitive advantage (the latter is what's currently happening to a lesser extent).  That competitive advantage undercuts the incentive for nations to commit to non-renewables, as they give in and turn back to fossil fuels for short-term advantage in the global market or watch their economy suffer.  \n  \nHonestly what it comes down to is lack of global governance.  Without any ability to regulate or enforce on a global scale, this kind of problem is impossible to address.

At some point you are right that it gets time-averaged over longer periods, but for several thousands of years it's not an issue (I know annual tree rings go back more than 5000 years).  A bigger problem is how variable the data is at an individual site and that the data is typically smoothed even if annual-scale data is available because weather fluctuates so much at that finer scale.  This is why annual-scale data from a variety of sites around the world is normally lined up and \"stacked\" to average out local variability.  It is analogous to what goes on when we take average temperature of the globe today.  We don't take it at one spot.\n\nAs an acknowledgement that you are right in principle, about mid-way through the chart (between 16000BCE and 15500BCE) the presentation makes the same point that you do about the possibility of time-averaging being a factor in whether a transient change is detectable.  However, from that a few years to decades might be possible.  Century-scale, not really.  And more than a century is the scale of what the uptick at the bottom is.\n\nThe [sources](https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1732:_Earth_Temperature_Timeline#Sources) for the chart are supplied if you want to look at the original data.  Even there, in the \"spikier\" data, the big spike at the end shows up very distinctively different.\n\nAbout the most dramatic thing that shows up is the Little Ice Age or the Younger Dryas, and those are still weak and relatively smoothed out by comparison in the rawer data in the primary sources.",

The entire world economy runs on fossil fuels, we need to replace almost everything and it may not be possible to give everyone the life they're accustomed too on diffuse renewable energy sources. \n\nRemember that discussions about energy renewables vs nuclear vs gas are generally about electricity. Moving things like transport and home heating to renewables is a whole other ball game. \n\nI've been involved in climate change, renewable energy etc for almost a decade and I'm coming to the conclusion that the task is simply too difficult for humans to achieve. When I got into this, I expected that as we approached the 2020's we'd be well underway with a war like effort to change our energy system. Despite great progress with renewables and especially their cost, it simply isn't happening fast enough.

There are no answers to these questions. Its just that liberals didn't like Trump and he seemed generally intolerant of things liberals usually think are important so therefore he gets the vote. No need to worry about anything else since SJW feminazi tumblrinas are the most pressing issue in America. You have this guy talking about how he voted for Trump because the biggest issue in America is that people exist who have different beliefs about American culture than him, and then in the same sentence complains about identity politics. The lack of self awareness is mind blowing. \n\nCan you imagine asking someone in real life what they thought the most pressing issue in America was and they said \"well it's far and away PC culture and feminazi tumblrina SJWs who hate America\"? You would laugh in their face if someone tried to have a serious conversation with you that way. These types of posts are pathetically hilarious, and reek of someone who spends too much time reading tumblrinaction and thinking that's how the real world is. What's even more hilarious is now these people think they won the culture war or whatever. Like what do they think Trump is going to do? Ban Tumblr? Shut down gender studies departments? Of course not, the President cannot change how people behave in society. What's sad is that these people have so much hate that Trump could spend the next 4 years personally draining their bank accounts and as long as liberals were upset about it they would be happy. \n\n",

This is the scientific paper that draws the conclusions that anthropogenic climate change likely contributed to the mass migration we're seeing in Syria http://www.pnas.org/content/112/11/3241.full.\n\nKey points:\n\n* Syria underwent a severe drought in 2007-2010, which included its driest winter (2007/2008) in observed records\n* While multiyear droughts are common in Syrian history, this drought in particular was exacerbated by many things:\n * Disproportionately higher demand for resources\n * Population growth both in Syria and from Iraqi migrants fleeing the Iraq war (2002-2006)\n *These 2 factors combined to grow Syria\u2019s population by over 50% in just 8 years*\n * Steep declines in groundwater supply, unable to be recharged by the low rainfall\n * Syria never fully recovered from its severe drought in the 1990s, and in fact was in moderate-severe drought from 1998-2009, with 7/11 years receiving rainfall below the century-long average\n * Poor government policies that emphasized upping agricultural production without regard to the above factors\n* Up to 1.5 million people were internally displaced by the drought, and the population migrated from farms to already overburdened cities\n* By 2010 internally displaced peoples and Iraqi refugees made up 20% of the urban population\nAssad\u2019s government neglected the decaying, overcrowded, under-resourced urban centers, which developed unrest that escalated to the full out Syrian civil war\n* The authors found strong agreement between observations and climate model simulations in century-long trends in precipitation, temperature, and sea-level pressure. This added confidence to the conclusion that in this region, the anthropogenic precipitation signal has already begun to emerge from the natural \u201cnoise\u201d and that the recent drought had a significant anthropogenic component. It also implies that model future projections of continued drying for Syria and the Fertile Crescent are reliable.\n\n\n[Here's another interesting article](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/aug/18/mass-migration-crisis-refugees-climate-change) that references the same paper but also discusses (through opinion) how areas that are being flooded with migrants now are likely to become migration zones themselves once heat/dryness reach them.",

This definition works well enough for animals such as mammals, but when you get down to the level of bacteria, reproduction is usually asexual, but then DNA can be shared between individuals \"sexually,\" but that has been observed to occur between individuals in different genera, which is a level of classification higher than species. \n\nOnce we consider the fact that a \"species\" is more of a man made construct which is useful to us, and less of a natural one that organisms always adhere to, then the adaptation versus evolution distinction becomes less of an important argument.

That's what fossil fuels are great for - consistent 24/7 power generation.\n\nNuclear power is an alternative for that \"baseload\" power generation without constant CO2 emissions. Fission is pretty good but there are concerns about radioactive waste and accidents like Chernobyl. Fusion has the same benefits, but does not have the same drawbacks. The worst fusion byproducts have half-lives of years and decades instead of centuries and millenia, and \"melting down\" is not possible. Plus, fusion fuel can be extracted from seawater, and estimates have that supply being good for millions, if not billions, of years.\n\nThe problem is that the process of fusion is really hard to sustain. We need more research funding to solve it, but governments have been loathe to commit any more than token resources.    \n\nEdit: Minor clarification",

    "body": "The others have covered it well, but the key points are thus: \n\nFusion provides a reliable, compact, and highly efficient energy process - comparable to the efficiency of fission (aka \"nuclear\" though both processes are technically nuclear reactions) power. The resources are among the most abundant in the universe, depending on what method/design of fusion you use. As humanity expands off of Earth, it's by far the most effective way to power our civilization (in conjunction with storage and solar, which is just a sneaky way to collect the sun's fusion output). On Earth, it means an end to the use of fossil fuels and a permanent, indefinite power source to remediate our environment - most of the blockages in reversing climate change founder on the high energy costs of pulling CO2 out of the air, which winds up creating more CO2. The value is just too huge to pass up. \n\nOn the other hand, the technology is not yet economical. We've been chasing reactor efficiencies and plasma designs for decades on the scraps of money that governments provide for this research. If we invested in fusion with the same determination as we've expended ignoring climate change or destabilizing inconvenient dictators overseas, we'd be well on our way to a Diamond Age of plenty by now. But hey, I guess people have other priorities than that.",

Could climate change have been a contributing factor? Certainly...especially when it comes to employment since agriculture is a fairly large industry in the country.

I'm not an expert, but there's a couple points your a little off on.\n\n> The worst fusion byproducts have half-lives of years and decades instead of centuries and millenia, and \"melting down\" is not possible.\n\nMy understanding is that radioactive byproducts of fusion are basically negligible.  In other words, it just doesn't produce enough byproduct to even really worry about, it's not like there's enough of it for us to collect, just a few atoms whizzing around.\n\n> The problem is that the process of fusion is really hard to sustain.\n\nThis is the bigger error.  It's not so much that it's hard to sustain, it's that it's hard to sustain the reaction without putting in more energy than you're getting out.  That's basically why we're stuck right now.  We can create fusion reactions, and they do produce energy, but the energy it costs us to sustain that reaction is more than we're getting out.  The popular tokomak model works by using electromagnetic fields to sustain plasma, but it's under such high pressure that we spend more energy maintaining the field than we can harvest.\n\nThat's why cold fusion was such a big deal back in the 70s.  If cold fusion was possible (i.e. we didn't have to keep the plasma at like 115 million degrees C), we would have a net positive on energy generation.  That's pretty much been debunked though.  So at this point, we either need to find a way to reduce the energy we have to feed in (achieve fusion at lower temperatures and/or lower pressure), or we need to increase our ability to harvest energy from the reaction.  There was an experiment with using lasers to start the reaction, and the energy absorbed by the fuel was less than the energy harvested from the reaction, but the fuel only absorbed a tiny bit of the total energy the laser put out.  If they could make the fuel absorb a higher percentage of the energy the laser was putting out, it could theoretically result in net positive energy generation.",
