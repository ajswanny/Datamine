And he is doing so through the Internet, which connects today's youth more than anything else.\n\n\nI'm always glad to find threads like this on Reddit, because the discussion here proves an old adage we have:\n\n\n\"People don't dislike the Church for what it teaches. People dislike the Church for what they are told the Church teaches.\"",

I suspect that a lot of the so-called \"Francis effect\" is really a belated \"Benedict effect\" as young Catholics and prospective Catholics continue to be drawn to the now-legalized and ever-more-popular Latin mass.\n\nI may have only been baptized and confirmed this year, but I still consider Pope Benedict to be \"my pope\" (though I am still loyal and supportive of the Holy Father Pope Francis of course).",

However, the Qur'an's use of the Gospel metaphor involving a camel and the eye of a needle (Matthew 19:23\u20134; Mark 10:25; Luke 18:25) applies this metaphor not to a \u201crich man\u201d as do the Gospels but instead to the man who fails to recognize God\u2019s signs. \n\nIndeed this seems to point to the oral transmission of biblical traditions, and not to the citation of a written text.",

Apparently, he did some crazy brave things that stopped Russian invasions and kept Europe as we know it alive.\n\n\nBenny was a scholar, who reminded everyone what it means to have the faith of a Catholic and to do good to all people. Many of the bad Christians we point and scoff at hated Ben because he stressed a Christian cannot do non-Christ-like things (or at least not attempt to do them).\n\n\nAnd of course Francis is a humble man of love and compassion, who went out and cared for the poor of the world, as well as reaching to the more stubborn folk of this time: first-world young adults.\n\n\nI'm glad to have lived in a time with three Popes, each strengthening our core values of Hope, Faith, and Charity.\n",
