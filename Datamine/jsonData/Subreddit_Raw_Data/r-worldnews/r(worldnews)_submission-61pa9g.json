    "body": "This legalization is going to be a mixed bag. The good news is Canadians can grow up to 4 plants. Assuming this means 4 female plants in the flowering stage (so that you could have 10-12 seedlings or plants in the vegetative stage) then this means that basically any household that wants to smoke for their own personal use up to about 3 adults on a pretty heavy 2-3 g a day habit would be able to at no additional cost save electricity and soil. Marijuana flowers take about 6 months from cradle to grave (from germination until they are ready to smoke) accounting for both stages of the life cycle and a modest cure period.\n\nThe reason why the personal use growth exemption is so critical is because efforts are already well under way to carve out grants of oligopoly production in the lucrative marijuana growing industry. The best solution would be to simply have an unregulated free market in marijuana. That is to say allow anyone to grow, produce, buy or sell marijuana. There is absolutely no legitimate reason to allow only a few large and powerful corporations to have strict control over the legal marijuana industry at the expense of potential smaller competitors. The marijuana industry is a powerful case study in the actual role of regulations in the market economy, which are not, contrary to popular belief, a means of ensuring companies act in the public interest but rather a method by which established business interests can smash their smaller competitors through the imposition of high fixed costs on an industry. Without the personal use growth exemption Canadians would be forced to subsidize these powerful business interests but with them the can simply grow their own which is a very simple process.",

    "body": "> Electoral reform is a lot harder to implement than marijuanna legalization.\n\nIt's not, really, they're both very simple decisions for the government to implement, although legalizing marijuana puts more onus on the government to form regulatory guidelines, and study and come up with the correct guidelines (funny how there's no \"how do we best legalize pot?\" committee), whereas electoral reform basically just involves picking the system you like, then asking Elections Canada to implement it, which according to them takes about 2.5 years.  \n\nThe real reason for backing out of electoral reform was because Justin Trudeau hates proportional representation.  He's been speaking against it since 2012.  The Liberal party's platform was to enact IRV ranked ballots (then at the last minute changed to \"consider all options\"), and the moment the electoral reform committee concluded IRV was worse than FPTP and PR was the only way to go, electoral reform was dead.\n\n>Nobody cares about reform,\n\n120,000 and counting signed onto the largest petition our government has ever received.  The 2005 BC referendum not only got 57% of the vote for STV (but required 60% to win), it got more people to the polls *than the actual election itself.*  Which is pretty strange for an issue that supposedly no one cares about.\n\nBut I do hope people like you keep reminding us how hard it is and how nobody cares anyway, because that just lights the fire underneath people's feet to push even harder on the issue, and punish those that lied to us about it.",

Eventually a tent greenhouse appeared in the backyard of one house and then the whole neighborhood knew. A nextdoor neighbor called the cops when the greenhouse was blooming. The cops took down the greenhouse (grows have to be inside) and informed the landlord, who immediately had the tenant evicted (Colorado landlords usually have a clause for this in the lease).\n\nPersonally it didn\u2019t bother me because I was down the street. But living next door to that must have got old quickly. And it\u2019s nothing compared to the commercial grows. For a while there was huge warehouse growing skunky weed and it reeked of skunk for half a mile in every direction. They\u2019ve changed strains, so now it just smells dank for a half mile in every direction. \n\nThis is becoming normal in Colorado. Many office and warehouse complexes have one or more grows that anyone with a nose can find. It can be really gross if a complex has a weed grow and a few breweries all taking turns stinking.",
