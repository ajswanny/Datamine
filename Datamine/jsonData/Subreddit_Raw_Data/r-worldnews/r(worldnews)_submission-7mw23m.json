Some would argue China has a moral right, as a state, to hold onto its few allies in the region in order to maximise its future survival.

This is the ugly truth of international relations, and pretty much routine. To equate China and North Korea with an unprecented attack on the efficacy of the US position in international affairs would be wrong. \n\nIf your problem is that China has misrepresented itself to other states...well...that has never happened before in international affairs.

Their phone number is (713) 483-3111. Explain that it's very important you get away as soon as possible.\n\n2. If they do not cooperate, phone any friend you may have in the White House - (202) 456-1414 - to have a word on your behalf with the guys at NASA.\n\n3. If you don't have any friends in the White House, phone the Kremlin (ask the overseas operator for 0107-095-295-9051). They don't have any friends there either (at least, none to speak of), but they do seem to have a little influence, so you might as well try.\n\n4. If that also fails, phone the Pope for guidance. His telephone number is 011-39-6-6982, and I gather his switchboard is infallible.\n\n5. If all these attempts fail, flag down a passing flying saucer and explain that it's vitally important you get away before your phone bill arrives.\n",

You want to talk about nation security, but heres the president, *trying* to provoke NK into doing something crazy. \n\nYou want to know how you get a scared, insecure, unstable kid to shut up and stop being a bully (NK)? Ignore all of the antics hes using to cover his insecurities, and try to help the guy (obviously easier than said given how brainwashed/fucked the NK propaganda machine has made its citizens, but still). The last thing that you do to the insecure, unstable kid is fucking edge him on ... something something shootings. \n\nYet, here we are.",

So the bald eagle PAC constantly works to keep the turkey man down. \n\nSo that \u201ccrime\u201d turkeys are guilty of?

    "body": "While I agree, it seems naive to expect others to do the right thing.  There are decent people in the world, a lot of them, but they tend not to climb political ladders.  Politicians have to make questionable moral decisions to succeed (bad mouth rivals, ignore the bad in people because of funding, pass a bad law because the majority of voters want it, etc), which makes it easier to keep making those decisions.  \n\nThe decent folk that try to do the right thing and be honest tend to not win elections at local levels, or burn out fighting a system designed to impede them, which means that almost all national level politicians are there to serve themselves.  But, there is usually wiggle room between self serving and as a secondary effect benefiting society.  I think that's where the inefficiency of government comes in, because very few of them are acting with the people's interests above their own.\n\nTake the Democratic party, my party, are they selfless?  Hell no.  They push for equality, safety net for the poor, etc because their constituents want that.  And it means they get votes that their Republican colleagues don't.  If 80% of americans wanted tax breaks for the rich and trickle down economics, it wouldn't be an election platform - both parties would agree on it.  But, and this is the important thing, the stuff they do for the purposes of getting elected, CAN also be good for the country.  It's just not the primary reason they do it.\n\nSo what's the solution?  Well, it's convincing that 30% GOP base that they are wrong, that what they want is not what's best for the country.  The political parties will shift and adapt to voters, or not get elected and be replaced.  Yes, money from the wealthy plays a part, but money alone doesn't win elections, it just sways the minds of voters.  But that's another option, get the money.  And then use it for good, back politicians and causes that benefit people.\n\nBut what can you do if getting the money is not an option?  Focus on the people around you.  Vitriol and hate does not change minds, and without changing minds nothing will change politically.  Educate, illuminate, sympathize, understand, listen...  and do it without expecting a result, because there likely won't be any - at least not visible.  But if even half of everyone stopped attacking, the other half might stop defending, and then a dialogue can develop...\n\nI'm sorry, not sure what I was trying to say, just started rambling\n\n",

If the North Korean regime collapses, the nation will go into chaos. No other nation would be able or willing to accept the millions of refugees pouring out of the country. America or South Korea couldn't just enter the country and \"liberate it\". Just like another person pointed out, that might give the opening for a group like ISIS to rise. What would happen to the nuclear weapons the North Korean regime possesses? What would happen to the army, or the brainwashed population?\n\nThere are so many problems that would need to be solved. No matter how terrible the North Korean regime currently is, the collapse of it might lead to a catastrophe larger than anyone could have imagined. ",
