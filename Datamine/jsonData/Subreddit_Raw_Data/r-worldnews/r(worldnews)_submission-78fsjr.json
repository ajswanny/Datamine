Joe and his wife donated money to Trump and the RNC. \n\nI'm not really too concerned with that sort of connenction, as it seems tangential at best really.\n\n>Joe Colonnetta is not the only Republican connection to the controversial Whitefish contract. On Monday, The Washington Post reported that Whitefish Chief Executive Officer Andy Techmanski is friends with Trump administration Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke. Moreover, Whitefish is located in Zinke\u2019s hometown of Whitefish, Monatana.\n\nThat seems a bit more suspect. That seems like crony capitalism. \n\n>Zinke isn\u2019t the only member of the Trump administration with a connection to the Whitefish contract. In addition to the Colonnettas\u2019 contributions to Trump\u2019s presidential campaign, Kimberly Colonnetta\u2019s Facebook page contains a photo of her with Ben Carson, Trump\u2019s secretary of housing and urban development. Another photo appears to show Kimberly Colonnetta with Trump Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. Both photos were posted the week of Trump\u2019s inauguration.\n\nPictures together at a ball/gala of sorts don't really bother me either. Donors trying to get pictures with people they donated too doesn't really raise any red flag. \n\n>The Colonnettas\u2019 contributions to the Republican Party precede the Trump administration. For example, in October 2011, Joe Colonnetta contributed $30,000 to the RNC; in 2008, he gave $26,200 to the RNC and $28,500 to the McCain Victory Committee. During both years, Kimberly Colonnetta also contributed thousands to various Republican campaigns.\n\nSo it seems like more of a Republican thing than Trump himself. ",

Joe is connected to Whitefish because he is currently a general partner with HBC Investments, as well as one of its founders, which is an equity-firm that finances Whitefish. Joe also did work with the state of Texas as a trustee, chairman, and adviser.\n\nThen you gots the Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke who's hometown is Whitefish, Montana where the company was founded, and he's buddies with the Chief Executive Officer (If there is only two people, does that make the only other person an executive officer?)\n\n------------------\n\nWhat I don't get is why this matters?\n\n>Whitefish officials have said that the company\u2019s expertise in mountainous areas makes it well suited for the work\n\n>Whitefish said Monday that it has 280 workers in the territory, using linemen from across the country, most of them as subcontractors, and that the number grows on average from 10 to 20 people a day.\n\n>Spokesman Chris Chiames dismissed criticism about the company\u2019s qualifications. \u201cWe are taking personal risks and business risks working in perilous physical and financial conditions,\u201d Chiames said. \u201cSo the carping by others is unfounded, and we stand by our work and our commitment to the people of Puerto Rico.\u201d\n\n>Zinke\u2019s office said he had no role in Whitefish securing the contract for work in Puerto Rico. Techmanski also said Zinke was not involved.\n\n> He said he had been in contact with the utility two weeks before Maria \u201cdiscussing the \u2018what if\u2019 scenarios\u201d of hurricane recovery. In the days after the hurricane, he said, \u201cit started to make sense that there was a need here for our services and others.\u201d\n\nEnding finally with a description of what the Department of Interior actually does: \n\n>The U.S. Department of the Interior is responsible for the management and conservation of most federal land and natural resources; \n\n----------\n\nThe Interior Secretary is in charge of federal parks, not whom a US Territory's power authority contracts during a natural disaster.\n\nJoe has been donating to the RNC since 2008 with John McCain. He's a republican. Are you not allowed to be Republican and employed in this nation? Or in this case, a Republican who is a general partner to a company that has invested in a company who just so happens to be from the same hometown as the guy in charge of parks.\n\nHBC Investments holds investments in 12 different companies valued at between 10-50m. Their site says the following about Whitefish:\n\n>HBC co-invested with Dallas-based Flat Creek Capital, LP to invest growth capital in Montana-based Whitefish Energy Holdings, LLC (\"WEH\"). WEH is an electrical utility service company focused on power line transmission and distribution, substation, renewable, and transformer manufacturing projects.",

The contract is the biggest yet issued in the troubled relief effort.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puerto_Rico_Electric_Power_Authority\n\n> The Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA) \u2014 is an electric power company and the **government-owned corporation of Puerto Rico** responsible for electricity generation, power transmission and power distribution in Puerto Rico.\n\nAnd to be clear - it is not federal govt owned - it is owned by Govt of  PR. So yes ... this seems highly screwed-up/corrupt ... but this is not something Trump would have any say in unless the Governor and ~~State legislature~~ territorial legislature (EDITED) of PR is taking their marching orders from Trump - which I'm not clear on why they would. So I'm not sure the fingers should be pointing to Trump here. Ultimately it is PR screwing PR ... ~~like~~ as is tradition.\n\nEDIT:\n\nTwo people have quoted this from the daily beast article:\n\n> However, PREPA spokesman Carlos Monroig Aceveda told weather.com that its contracts \u201care evaluated and awarded by the U.S. Corps of Engineers in coordination with FEMA, which disburses the money.\u201d\n\nThe thing is though, from WaPo article - this does not seem to be the case:\n\n> The power authority, also known as PREPA, opted to hire Whitefish rather than activate the \u201cmutual aid\u201d arrangements it has with other utilities. For many years, such agreements have helped U.S. utilities \u2014 including those in Florida and Texas recently \u2014 to recover quickly after natural disasters.\n\n> [...]\n\n> PREPA\u2019s executive director, Ricardo Ramos, and a spokesman did not respond to emails asking why the utility didn\u2019t activate the mutual-aid network. On a tour of the idled Palo Seco power plant, Ramos told reporters that Whitefish was the first company \u201cavailable to arrive and they were the ones that first accepted terms and conditions for PREPA.\u201d\n\n> Ramos said that the utility is \u201ccompletely content\u201d with the work Whitefish is doing. \u201cThe doubts that have been raised about Whitefish, from my point of view, are completely unfounded,\u201d he added, saying that concerns about Whitefish were probably spread by jealous competitors.\n\nEDIT Also, from the daily beast article:\n\n> Federal agencies like FEMA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which are ordinarily responsible for evaluating contracts for disaster responses, have attempted to distance themselves from the Whitefish contract. FEMA did not respond to The Daily Beast\u2019s request for comment on the contract. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, on the other hand, told The Daily Beast that it \u201cdoes not comment on contracting decisions made by external organizations that do not involve USACE.\u201d",

In fact, he was in the first Basic UDT/SEAL (BUD/S) class to graduate under my command in 1985. I remember him well and thought that he would have a stellar career.\n> \n> \n> \n> He did have such a career until he showed a defect in his moral make-up, and the Left is already well aware of what he did, although perhaps not in so much detail as I go into. They will, however, before the general election, so I have decided to anticipate them by providing this statement.\n> \n> \n> \n> This information was provided to me by sources personally known to me and to those who were directly involved in the actions involving Ryan.\n> \n> \n> \n> What did he do? Simple\u2014he used Navy (taxpayer) travel funds to make multiple trips from Norfolk, VA, to his home in MT, ostensibly to scout out training sites for his squadron. The truth was that he went to work on some family property and, apparently, on one occasion, took two or three other Navy SEALs with him.\n> \n> \n> \n> These trips not only involved airfare, but they also involved per diem and personal use of Navy time. To his credit, Ryan, when confronted with his transgressions, admitted his culpability and paid back the funds he had expended.\n> \n> \n> \n> Ryan\u2019s moral failings, in my opinion, do not end with his being separated from his SEAL team over the travel scandal. His political career has some questionable acts associated with it, to include his creation (with some heavy-hitting New York and Boston lawyers and PR people) of Special Operations for America (SOFA), a Political Action Committee, back in early 2012. At that time, I sought out Ryan to work with me in establishing an umbrella organization of Special Operations Forces from all the services.\n> \n> \n> \n> After looking carefully at the situation in which he was involved, I just didn\u2019t feel comfortable getting hooked up with what was clearly going to be a high-donor operation and possibly geared to Ryan\u2019s future political benefit. That has turned out to be the case, as evinced by the fact that, almost immediately after Ryan declared his candidacy for the US House, he resigned as SOFA\u2019s chairman and was given a grant from the very Political Action Committee he established. That, to me, is not \u201cconflict of interest;\u201d it is \u201ccoincidence of interest.\u201d\n> \n> \n> \n> The account of what I have read about SOFA having its headquarters in property owned by the Zinke family that is across the street from the Zinke family home, further validates the \u201ccoincidence of interest\u201d hypothesis.\n> \n> \n> \n> As a retired Navy SEAL officer, I also take exception to the looseness with which Ryan described his Navy career. Depending on which bio one reads, he was \u201ca\u201d or \u201cthe\u201d commander in a certain high-capability Navy SEAL Team. He was never a commanding officer and was bypassed for possible consideration for promotion to captain as the result of his travel transgressions.\n> \n> \n> \n> He also has stated that former Cong. Allen West has endorsed his candidacy. I spoke with Colonel West personally and learned that, while he spoke kind words about Ryan, he did not endorse him. Subsequent to my conversation with him, Colonel West has made clear that that was not the case and will not be the case during the primary.\n> \n> \n> \n> Having seen a heavily redacted copy of Ryan\u2019s DD-214, which is a summary of his military career, I noted that, unlike his claim to have received two Bronze Stars for combat, he actually received them for meritorious service. Neither had the Combat \u201cV\u201d for Valor, which would have been the case had he earned the awards for combat.\n> \n> \n> \n> The statement by a retired Navy SEAL Master Chief sums up the essence of Ryan\u2019s character. The man told me personally that Ryan is PNG (persona non grata) at his old SEAL team, primarily for the misleading statements he has made about his rank and importance at that \u201cspecial\u201d team. That is a sad commentary on a man who had all the potential in the world and has, instead of coming clean about himself and his mistakes, tries to re-write his personal history in order to achieve political office.\n> \n> \n> \n> I am certain that Ryan would have acquitted himself well if he had led his men in actual combat instead of being a theater manager of the combat units assigned to him.\n> \n> \n> \n> I am sure that Ryan will do his best to rebut these serious allegations. He can prove me wrong by making his unredacted DD-214 available for public examination. I would like nothing better than to have been shown that I was wrong, but that won\u2019t happen.\n> \n> \n> \n> Why do I, a transplanted Texan living in NC, want to rupture more than one friendship over Ryan Zinke\u2019s candidacy for the US House of Representatives? Simple\u2014Ryan\u2019s ambitions will not stop here. He has shown by his dissimulation of facts regarding his career that he is willing to do whatever it takes to reach the next level\u2014in his case, the US Senate. I cannot abide that prospect, because THEN he is representing ME and every citizen of this land as a member of one of the world\u2019s most prestigious deliberative bodies.\n> \n> \n> \n> Larry Bailey\n> \n> \n> \n> CAPT (SEAL), USN (Ret.)\n> \n> \n> \n> Chocowinity, NC*\n\ncredit to /u/WestwardHo",

Then they hire subcontractors to do the work if they don't have that actual expertise. \n\nNow, apparently this contract is irregular as all hell to begin with so it's apples and oranges to compare this to that.

I don't know the specifics but Whitefish may have actually been ready and willing to do the work while others have resources tied up elsewhere. Also consider that Whitefish may not actually be doing the work, they are probably just organizing other small companies to come in that have high availability. None of those smaller companies could win a contract of that size but banded together under one management, it's much easier to win.
