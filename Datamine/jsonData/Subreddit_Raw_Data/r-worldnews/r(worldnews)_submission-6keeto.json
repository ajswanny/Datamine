At the last election the government in power, The Liberals, ran saying they would hold a plebiscite/referendum on the issue if they won. This was largely opposed by the public and the opposition party, Labor, as the 'Marriage Act' could be changed with a standard bill in parliament without a plebiscite saving $160 million. Another aspect to it was that the plebiscite The Liberals wanted was non-binding meaning parliament still would have to vote on it after the public vote but the politicians wouldn't need to follow the public vote, many politicians said they would disregard the public vote and this further made people oppose it. The Labor Party said if voted into power they would push a bill straight through parliament however in the end the Liberal party won. They tried to hold a plebiscite after the election except the Labor party and the other parties in parliament blocked it. So now on one hand we have the Liberals who won't pass a marriage bill in parliament without a plebiscite however Labor and the other parties won't let them hold it so it has all grounded to a halt and most probably won't be talked about until the next election in 3 years.

You had to write \"verpartnert\", which was basically a mandatory outing in several situations. So a partnership not being a marriage was a pretty big deal. Until 2012 (I think) in Baden W\u00fcrttemberg you couldn't even finalize your partnership at a Standesamt, where state weddings usually take place.

Keep in mind though that that aren't just new people but also people who live here for years and only got there \nresidency permit extended, but let's ignore these people.

Seen from the EU, the US just does not have an actual left-wing party or candidate. They are all different degrees of right-wing.\n\nConversely, seen from the US, the EU has some crazy communist shit, such as single-payer healthcare, free higher education in many countries, and a great enphasis on being able to get everywhere with public transport, while taxing cars and gasoline. \n\nAlso, in the EU there is no war on drugs, and there's more emphasis on rehab than on punishment. And you don't get a bigger sentence just for trying to escape jail, because trying to escape jail is just human nature, we are not made to be confined.\n\nThere's a long list of differences.

He would be lost in a SPD (despite them being pretty central for a left party)\n\nBecause those are all fantastic ways to lose a presidential election in the United States. Hell, it may not even carry you through the Democratic primary, as we saw with Bernie Sanders. Americans skew much, much further right than Europeans. Mainline democrats are European centrists, American moderates are more akin to European conservatives, and the gigantic American right  at upwards of 35% of the voting population is akin to the various right-wing fringe parties that get a half dozen seats here and there. Mainline left wing European parties are represented by a handful of the most liberal Democrats and European fringe left parties are basically unrepresented at any level of American government. I have little doubt Obama personally believes in all those things, however he's pragmatic, like most left-wing American politicians, and knew the American voters weren't ready to embrace those policies at the time. Remember he was quick enough to embrace the gay marriage ruling once it made it through the Supreme Court.\n\nCDU isn't really a good comparison to others anyways, at least in the Anglosphere and most of Europe, as it's one of the few conservative parties that has maintained social justice as one of its tenants, presumably because of its role as a Christian (-ish) political party.",

Some countries (the Netherlands, Portugal) have a crime reduction approach and others are crawling towards that direction (Denmark), but this is not even close to the majority. \n\nFor instance Sweden has almost parliamentary unanimity on the zero tolerance policy towards drug use. Only the Socialist party with like 5% of the vote and some liberal youth sections with no power are against the current dogmatic policies. You can't even have needle exchange programs without the mainstream parties arguing that those \"encourage\" drug use.     \n\nEdit: Here is a pretty good debate (in English) on the state of European drug policy.
