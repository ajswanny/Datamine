This would be the first time they do it with a ballistic missile, which is of course quite provocative. \n\nEdit 3: ~~[SK's JCS](http://www.yonhapnews.co.kr/bulletin/2017/08/29/0200000000AKR20170829011600014.HTML?source=twitter) says it was a submarine-launched ballistic missile. If true, it could be the [Pukkuksong-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pukkuksong-1), which has been tested before. It could also be the Pukkuksong-3, a prototype [which has received some attention recently](http://thediplomat.com/2017/08/something-new-something-old-north-koreas-next-missiles/) and is assessed to have a higher range.~~ (as /u/gaedaegari has clarified, the JCS does not assess the test to be an SLBM launch anymore) Edit: However, it has also been reported that the launch was from the vicinity of Pyongyang, and [US government sources](https://twitter.com/nktpnd/status/902286999855476736) mentioned preparations for a Hwasong-12 intermediate range ballistic missile launch earlier today. \n\nEdit 4: ~~According to the Japan, three missiles were launched: https://twitter.com/W7VOA/status/902283161257656320~~ (edit: follow-up reports mentioned below suggest a single missile is more likely). \n\nEdit 5: Missile(s) apparently landed ~1,200 km off Hokkaido's coast (so no threat to Guam): https://twitter.com/martyn_williams/status/902283213791305728\n\nHere is the approximate flight path: https://twitter.com/Joshua_Pollack/status/902313375308369920\n\nEdit 6: [Reports suggest](https://twitter.com/CNBC/status/902284461512966144) it was one missile that \"broke\" into three pieces towards the end of the flight (some experts speculate if it was a test of multiple reentry vehicles; too early to tell - it doesn't seem too likely, given that NK has never made any claims about working on that technology and is more likely to try to prove the capability of its standard reentry vehicles on its first long range launch). [Initial Pentagon statement](https://twitter.com/jseldin/status/902291268369305600) also mentions only one missile. We should have a pretty clear picture of the technical details once [PACOM](https://twitter.com/PacificCommand) releases its assessment. \n\nEdit 7: [Missile(s) flew ~2,700 km, with a 550 km apogee](https://twitter.com/YonhapNews/status/902288957857161216). [Looking  at the probable launch site] (https://twitter.com/nktpnd/status/902290243642064896), the Hwasong-12 IRBM is a [likely candidate](https://twitter.com/nktpnd/status/902290845382180864) (edit: something the [Japanese defense ministry](https://twitter.com/Rover829/status/902331290598293504) now believes as well), suggesting earlier reports of a SLBM launch might have been inaccurate. \n\nEdit 8: [An analyst's thoughts on what this test means:](https://twitter.com/nktpnd/status/902298351332405248)\n\n> The reactions from both Japan and the United States will be critical in ensuring the frequency of launches like this, overflying Japan.\n\n> Last year, after years, North Korea splashed down a Nodong in Japan's EEZ; Tokyo spoke out, but did little else. EEZ splashdowns continued.\n\n> Similarly, if North Korea assesses the costs of overflying Japan to be *anything* but intolerable, we'll see more of these kinds of tests.\n\n> That's the nightmare scenario that Japanese defense planners have feared for years now. Today is really quite a horrible day for Japan.\n\nEdit 9: [Here's an article](http://thediplomat.com/2017/08/why-north-korea-is-planning-long-range-missile-flight-tests-over-japan-and-toward-guam/) on what NK has to gain from long range tests overflying Japan. One point is that it allows them to test reentry vehicles on normal trajectories (unlike the lofted trajectories of launches into the Sea of Japan, which expose RVs to higher structural stresses). [The CIA](http://thediplomat.com/2017/08/us-intelligence-north-koreas-icbm-reentry-vehicles-are-likely-good-enough-to-hit-the-continental-us/) already assesses the Hwasong-14 ICBM RV to be good enough for a minimum energy trajectory targeting the continental US. NK might want to test its ICBM at a long range to demonstrate this capability. \n\nEdit 10: [The Hwasong-12 IRBM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hwasong-12), which was likely used for this test, is estimated to have a range of over 4,000 km. When NK threatened to launch a salvo into the waters off Guam earlier this month, this is the missile they intended to use. Obviously they didn't go that far with this test, instead launching just one missile in a different direction at a shorter range. \n\nEdit 11: [Cheong Wa Dae says U.S. considering deploying 'strategic' defense capabilities to S. Korea](http://english.yonhapnews.co.kr/news/2017/08/29/0200000000AEN20170829005100315.html?sns=tw). A similar statement followed NK's first ICBM test in July, could mean something like the deployment of more THAAD batteries. \n\nEdit 12: Some ask why the missile wasn't intercepted. [This article](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/11/world/asia/guam-north-korea-missile-defense.html?mcubz=0) was published after NK threatened Guam and examines the capabilities of various missile defense systems in a scenario of an IRBM overflight of Japan towards Guam. The trajectory displayed in today's test leaves the US and Japanese SM-3 interceptors as only viable system. Successful interception would depend on several factors, including the position of Aegis destroyers in relation to the missile's trajectory. It could be done (though probably not consistently), but it doesn't look like it was attempted today. \n\nEdit 13: Some early analysis of today's launch and possible responses: [5 Takeaways on North Korea's Ballistic Missile Overflight of Japan - North Korea carries out what is likely its most provocative ballistic missile test to date](http://thediplomat.com/2017/08/5-takeaways-on-north-koreas-ballistic-missile-overflight-of-japan/?utm_content=buffereff47&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer)\n\n____________________________________________________________\n\nNorth Korea really stepped up its provocation game today, opening the door for future overflights of Japan, possibly at even longer ranges and flight paths closer to Guam. Tomorrow, with the release of PACOM's assessment, we will have a better idea of what exactly NK launched and how successful the test was. ",

    "body": "ITT:\n\"Why didn't they shoot it down? What about the missile shield!\" - Shooting down a ballistic missile is hard and those systems are less than 50% effective. Using them on a test missile would expose their locations making them vulnerable to destruction before an actual attack.  \n\"No video? Clearly fake\" Except it's a ballistic missile that went in a parabolic arch over Japan, reaching an altitude 100 miles higher than the International Space Station. It's not something you catch on video.  \n\"Well obviously now we have to go to war before they make a first strike and kill thousands\" Except that if we did attack them, the first thing that would happen is hundreds of thousands of people would die in Seoul. Immediately, impossible to prevent. The follow up would be a short but brutal war wherein millions of South Koreans, thousands of U.S. soldiers, and millions of North Koreans (some of whom are not complicit in their government's actions) would die. The global economy would tank due to the huge disruption to technology manufacturing in South Korea. There'd a huge refugee crisis on the border with China. And there'd be the potential for a China/U.S. war. An attack on North Korea would end the North Korean threat, and spark millions of deaths and a long lasting economic and humanitarian crisis.  \n\"Send in spec ops and take out Un that'll stop this\" First, this assumes that the NK government wouldn't enact the above scenario in retaliation. On the slim chance they don't retaliate, now you've got a likelihood of multiple warlords trying to claim control of a country in possession of chemical and nuclear weaponry. Now you've got the possibility of terrorist groups purchasing/stealing those weapons, and one of those warlords using those weapons for a chance to consolidate their own power.  \n  \nThere is no easy solution to the problem that is North Korea. Any solution that involves war WILL result in millions dead and a significantly altered global landscape. If you think that a preemptive strike on NK or an assassination of NK leadership will magically fix this problem, you're either ignorant or an idiot. World governments have spent decades trying to figure out how to resolve this problem. It's not easy.",

    "body": "Here are tips for reacting to a missle attack like this in the future for people in Japan like myself that didn't really know what to do this morning.\n\nI hope people will still be able to see this comment among the others:\n\n&nbsp;\n\n[WHAT TO DO WHEN A MISSILE HAS BEEN FIRED]\n\nWhen a missile has been fired, there is only a short amount of time between\nfiring and impact, so action must be taken immediately. If you receive an\nemergency alert containing the phrase \u30df\u30b5\u30a4\u30eb\u767a\u5c04 (misairu hassha), please\nrespond immediately, follow the instructions of any authorities and await\nfurther instruction and information.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIf you are INDOORS:\n\n1. REMAIN CALM.\n\n2. SHUT DOORS AND WINDOWS. TURN OFF GAS, WATER AND VENTILATORS.\n\n3. DO NOT GO OUTDOORS. While you may feel the urge to head to the nearest\nevacuation area or to find a bomb shelter, the safest thing you can do is\nremain indoors.\n\n4. STAY AWAY FROM WINDOWS. If you are able, head to a room in your house or\napartment with no windows. If you are able, head underground or as close to\nthe ground floor as possible.\n\n5. BRACE FOR ANY POTENTIAL IMPACT by covering your head and face and putting\nyourself between or under STABLE objects (tables etc).\n\n6. TURN ON YOUR TELEVISION or stay close to your phone so that further\ninstructions and information can be transmitted.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIf you are OUTDOORS:\n\n1. REMAIN CALM.\n\n2. HEAD INDOORS IMMEDIATELY: Head to the nearest robust building or\nunderground shopping arcade. Follow instructions above now that you are\nindoors. **OR** IF YOU ARE DRIVING A CAR: Stop the car and leave it off of the road. If\nyou must leave your car, park it unlocked on the left side of the road so\nthat it does not obstruct emergency vehicles.\n\n3. IF YOU ARE UNABLE TO MAKE IT INDOORS: Drop to the ground and cover your\nhead and face.\n\n4. REMAIN CLOSE TO YOUR PHONE so that further instructions and information\ncan be transmitted.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n[AFTER TAKING THESE ACTIONS]\n\nFollow instructions issued by administrative agencies for further\nevacuation.\n\nIF YOU ARE TRAPPED\n\nIf you are trapped under debris, it is important to keep the following in\nmind:\n\n- Do NOT use a cigarette lighter or any other open flame to illuminate your\nsurroundings.\n\n- Do NOT move around unnecessarily - cover your mouth or nose with a\nhandkerchief or other cloth item to prevent inhaling dust.\n\n- In order to inform people of your whereabouts, beat the plumbing or take a\nsimilar action.\n\n- Only yell out as a last resort, as this can lead to inhalation of dust.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nKeep an emergency kit in an easily accessible area. Always keep it\npre-packed (for example, in a backpack). Remember to keep it maintained and\ncycle perishable items out.\n\nMost important items to keep in an emergency kit:\n\n- WATER: 4 liters per person per day (=1 gallon)\n\n- FOOD: Min. 3 days worth of non-perishable, easy-to-prepare food. (Canned,\nshelf-stable - some food items such as Calorie-Mate have special\nnon-perishable versions - look for \u4fdd\u5b58\u98df - Hozon-shoku)\n\n- IDENTIFICATION: Copy of passport, copy of residence card, copy of driving\nlicense, copy of my-number card, etc.\n\n- FIRST AID KIT: Essential medication and prescriptions, bandages.\n\nOther important items:\n\n- Plastic wrap and paper cups, plates, plastic utensils\n\n- Manual can opener\n\n- Flashlight, include extra batteries (a wind-up flashlight is also a good\nidea)\n\n- Portable radio with extra batteries\n\n- Filter mask\n\n- Whistle\n\n- Wrench, pliers, other tools to help turn off utilities\n\n- Personal hygiene items\n\n- Garbage bags\n\n- Space blanket (reflective plastic blanket)\n\n- Cash (Around 30,000 yen should be enough)\n\n- Family and emergency contact info\n\n- Map of the area\n\nEdit: Removed irrelevant information\n\nEdit2: Also, from when I received the emergency message about the incoming missile to when I received the message saying it passed, it was 12 minutes. Therefore, it seems you would generally have about 10 minutes to react for Japan. I did not have sirens go off in my city probably because its pretty small and so I don't think they have any, therefore I don't know how early those went off.\n\nEdit3: I thought I would add that I received this information 2nd hand from a participant in the JET Program. The program is supposedly very good at emergency preparedness for their employees. However, this was a rushed message during the crisis and not an official statement from the program and is instead advice from one of their prefectural advisors, but still great advice none the less. I would recommend looking to other sources for further information on the matter.\n\nEdit4: Formatting\n\nEdit5: I want to clarify that this is not meant to instill fear in anyone. I am not trying to say \"prepare for an attack\" but instead \"this is a general idea of how you can prepare for this situation or act in this situation if it happens.\" I myself was woken up by the alert this morning and had no idea what to do about it. I've prepared for earthquakes and other natural disasters since I live in Japan but never something like this, so I got some good tips and figured I'd pass it on. That is all this post is meant to be. I also hope I don't have to remind people in 2017 of the possibility of Japan manipulating media in order to push for certain decisions, instill fear in their own citizens for a greater goal, or what have you. Not saying that's what I believe but it's certainly not something to just ignore either. I apologize if this post has affected you in a negative way. I made it in hopes of being helpful to people like me not knowing how to act in the situation.",

We are technically still at war with NK, no treaty was ever signed, just a pause to military actions.\n\n2. The US and Allies are relucant to cause military conflict with NK, due to the sheer humanitarian disaster it'd be. NK has mass artillery pointed at South Koreas capital and most populous city, Seoul which would cause thousands of civilian deaths in the first few minutes of conflict. Also if the US and allies defeat NK they have to deal with the tens of millions of refugess from NK, which no one wants to deal with as its also very expensive.\n\n3. There's no real economic benefit from attacking NK. Its purely a war over failed diplomacy and diverging idealogies. It'd probably be a lot more justifiable to take on all these civilian casualties and refugees if NK had mountains of gold and oil. But they don't so there's no real economic incentives either. \n\nEdit: for those saying we arent at war, i guess you can say you're right on a technicality. But the point still stands, that the conflict never ended with a peace agreement\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_Armistice_Agreement   ",

A pro is that you get a free test of your missile defense system.  A con is that you give the other side a free test of bypassing your missile defense system, depending on whether you think they can monitor you.  If you don't think they can monitor your test then it is less harmful to try.  I'm sure NK had telemetry from their own missile, but I'm not sure how well they could track it on radar once it left their airspace, or whether they would be able to detect interception attempts, unless they had ships with sufficient equipment at sea in the area.",

They also have a huge food shortage issue, with most of the food they do generate or have donated goes towards feeding the rich, then the military, then whatever is left. So there is a huge incentive to \"serve\" your country which usually means accepting the propaganda else putting yourself as \"different.\" \n\nSo Kimmy is struggling to keep power. With all the \"free information\" being smuggled in, his people are starting to wise up that they aren't at war with the west nor is the west trying to destroy them. Which leaves them asking, \"Why are we spending all this money on middle programs if we aren't at war? I can't afford to eat!\" Well, it's kinda two fold for Kimmy. He has to find a way to maintain control, otherwise the country will shift democratic really quickly and he will be outed and will no longer have the extravagant lifestyle he does now. But he also can't outright start a war, knowing full well that he would lose. So his *best* option is to provoke his enemies into attacking him. He would then be able to down play the missle thing as something other than an act of war. This would rally his countrymen by his side again and buy him another decade in power.",

They risk a number of scenarios from absorbing a humanitarian crisis to having US/US Ally occupation on their border (which they desperately do not want). Their strategy is, hope NK stays fixated on US. I believe to fix this, China needs pressured on an international front, outside of the UN, since they simply don't enforce UN sanctions. This would likely take a lot of bargaining from a very, very influential Sec of State. Given the current intentional understaffing at the US State Dept., the manpower to even attempt a project this large is laughable, at best. ",
