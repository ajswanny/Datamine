China apparently uses about 5.9 million GWh of energy per year. 1% of that is 59,000 GWh. That corresponds to 1.44 hours per day at peak capacity.\n\nThe above calculation demonstrates the difficulty of going completely solar. If the percentage of power produced by solar is low, its relative lack of reliability isn't really an issue. Any shortfall can be made up for through the use of conventional sources such as coal. However, for a country like Germany which produces roughly 6.5% of its energy from solar and another 13.3% from wind, lack of reliability is a much bigger issue.

Once panel development and power output has hit practical upper limit then major adoption would follow. The uncertainty of govt. subsidies have now become a hindrance more than actually driving adoption. Earlier it used to be that people incl. myself would be enthusiastic about calculating subsidies and such now its just one more thing you have to take care of yourself when considering solar. It'll happen, just not at a pace that everyone else is pushing it.",

In the US, [WWS accounts for 13% of US electricity generation.](https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=427&t=3) This is primarily due to hydropower being used far less in the US than in China. For example, wind power in China produced 240.8 Twh of electricity vs. 228 Twh of electricity in the US; since China produces far more electricity overall, wind power makes up a larger share of electricity production in the US than in China.\n\nAnother wildcard is that nuclear power is a far stronger force in US electricity generation. Nuclear accounted for nearly 20% of US electricity generation vs 3.3% of China's generation. While nuclear is not technically renewable, [most estimates suggest with modest technological advances, it could power human civilization for centuries at least.](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-long-will-global-uranium-deposits-last/) If nuclear was added to renewable categories of both nations, China would produce 28.8% of its electricity from renewables while the US would produce 34.6% of its electricity from renewables.\n\nFinally, the vast majority of China's nonrenewable electricity comes from coal while over half of the US's nonrenewable electricity is produced by the cleaner and greener natural gas.",

India wants to buy plants from them. All good except historically the country of operation is responsible if it fails. Which is a huge deterrent. Would you buy a brand new car if the company you were buying it from told you that if anything went wrong YOU were entirely liable?\n\nNow recently though, India I think managed to make the manufacturers liable, at least to some extent, which I believe has allowed the french company to move into that market.

That's an improvement, but currently solar power [only contributes 0.7%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renewable_energy_in_the_United_States) of the total power generated in the US.  10 times 0.7 is still only 7%.  An increase for sure, but not in the 6 year timeline projected by the comment above you.\n\nItaly is [ranked first in the world for solar power production as a percentage of power consumed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_power_in_Italy), at 7%.  That figure is projected to double by 2030, 13 years from now.  Doubling energy production every two years is an absurd prediction.\n\nThere is no reason to believe that China will outperform every other country in regards to solar power production.  In fact, it is even harder for China than it is for smaller countries like Italy or Germany.  China is just taking its first few steps down this road, and it will be a long time until solar power contributes any meaningful amount to China, or the world.",

Part of the argument is that as electric transportation takes off, the share of fossil fuel usage will decline, and demand for electricity will further increase.\n\n[The EIA and other agencies have consistently underestimated growth rates](https://www.vox.com/platform/amp/energy-and-environment/2017/8/30/16224582/wind-solar-exceed-expectations-again), in part because their models don't account for tech synergies like the above, or sub-national policy incentives. \n\nI agree that exponential growth isn't likely, but certainly something above linear will continue for a while now, especially as companies start working on reducing other cost components (e.g., design and installation costs). I wouldn't be surprised if solar ended up being 20% or more of the energy mix by 2040. California has already pushed it to 14%, and is just now running into grid issues.

Nothing matters because of course \"there's fake news on ALL sides\" and \"both parties are the same\". There's no objective reality anymore because the facts you don't agree with are probably just as biased as the facts you like, so you might as well just go with your gut and remain apathetic or support the status quo.\n\nAsk Trump supporters how they feel about the mountains of examples of Trump lying to their faces, or outlets like Breitbart and Fox following suite. They don't care. Its not because they think Trump is trustworthy or Fox/Alex Jones/Milo Yiannopoulous are factual, they just think everyone else is just as partisan and biased as their alt-fact, alt-right, alt-reality daddies are. Consistent arguments are for the opposition! We'd rather win first, then decide what's real later.\n\nJean-Paul Sartre noticed this trend in the rise in anti-semite groups in the 20's and 30's. They couldn't be reasoned with, he argued, because they reveled in bad faith arguments. Its a chilling parallel to the state of our neo-fascist political system today.\n\nIt's not that these people are necessarily uneducated or unaware - they know what the facts are, they just don't care. Because your \"facts\" simply must be just as biased as my alternative ones.",

Median income is generally a better estimate than GDP per Capita but the economic structure of the Soviet Union makes median income pretty hard to measure and arbitrary. Life expectancy, completion of primary school, alcoholism, crime rates and suicide rates can also be used but each one gives only a partial glimpse into a country. These are often very hard statistics to come by especially for a place like the Soviet Union. ",
