The Criminal Code of Canada is the federal statue which will be changed by the bill, and will mean Marjuana is legal in all of Canada, period. Provincial laws cannot overrule Federal law. Our criminal code is the law of the land when it comes to  criminal laws.\n\nHowever, provinces will have control the distribution, sale and control of Marijuana, same as with Alcohol. Provinces will get to decide when, where and how it is sold and consumed. They cannot say that it is illegal in their province. \n\nAll provinces appear to have their own varied approach to how they will do this; some plan to sell in already existing liquor stores, others will have their own specialty shops, much LIKE liquor stores, but for weed.\n\nCanadian Federal laws address seperate issues than Provincial laws. Provices have control over things like highway laws, healthcare and education. Provinces have no say over Federal criminal law, we are not the US.\n\nI work in the field, and the lack of understanding is outstanding. Also, there is a TON of things left to sort out which is not addressed in the Federal bill.",

However Richmond which is a city next to Vancouver doesn't want store fronts so apparently will be pushing for it to be sold in Liquor stores there. So it's down to a municipal level as well on how it's being sold. I assume this puts enforcement to a municipal level, which will create issues similar to what we have now in B.C. where municipal police forces enforce/interpret current pots laws differently than that of towns that use the RCMP.\n\nOn top of this various health organizations don't want Pot sold where alcohol is sold and so there will be some push back from that. \n\nThe B.C. liquor stores would also need to create different warehouses to store merchandise which will likely increase it's cost as well. I remember listening to an interview with a private Liquor store owner about how these warehouses work. A 750ml(26oz) bottle of Vodka was something like 2 bucks, then once you add in the warehouse fee, shipping, the taxes on Spirits and so forth, the bottle then becomes 22 bucks or so for \"cheap\" vodka, then because you're a private store you need to add your running costs on top of that so the bottle becomes 25 bucks.\n\nSo while Pot will apparently be sold or available to sell in private stores as well, it will likely be more expensive than if you were to buy it in a Government liquor store which would further drive their liquor sales since why would you not buy your alcohol there as well. This is bad for the smaller stores who already have a disadvantage of having to buy their stock from the competition and thus sell it higher, and they get by on the convenience of location which they still will I suppose, but I think it'll be a little more of a struggle for them for people that are going to shop for both products the price difference will start to beat out the convenience by a larger margin.\n\n\nI don't smoke anymore, and won't even when it becomes legal. Despite this I really don't like the Liquor branch distributing it. I don't like how it increases the prices, and I don't think it's the right direction to go in terms of cutting into Illegal sales. Which I think are going to continue to thrive off younger people especially so since it'll be , at least in B.C. 19 years old to purchase, if it's confined to liquor stores, which is going to force teenagers to get it some other way.",

Despite it being legal in some states, they are getting the power to outright ban you from the states if you admit to have even smoking it... 'Cause why not, they've already had attempts at banning people for having mental disorders like depression (There was an old article from the Toronto Star I believe where they pulled a womens medical records, records they legally didn't have the right to, saw she tried to commit suicide years back and they banned her as she was trying to go through security), so it's likely they'll crank this up just because they can.\n\nSource: Plenty of articles around, but [Macleans did one earlier this year](http://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/if-youve-ever-smoked-marijuana-beware-of-the-u-s-border/)",

Provinces will get to decide when, where and how it is sold and consumed.\n\nAnother way to say what you claimed there is that provinces can decide which ways it is illegal to own and sale (and we shall add growing) marijuana. So, the next claim:\n\n> They cannot say that it is illegal in their province.\n\nYou should rather say they cannot say that it is a **crime** in their province. In short, the federal government is in charge of criminal law and the provincial governments are in charge of the civil law.\n\n> I work in the field, and the lack of understanding is outstanding. Also, there is a TON of things left to sort out which is not addressed in the Federal bill.\n\nVery understandable. Even the law makers argue about who is in charge of what! Sometime, when you have an issue in Canada, you can contact a provincial government representative and he says\"I can do nothing for you, contact the federal government\" and then, you contact the provincial government and he says \"I can do nothing for you, contact the provincial government\".\n",

You can regulate the wallets of consumers and if they choose to partake then they are helping the province as a whole and not hurting by burdening it with subsequent health problems in the liver, lung, throat, etc. Which are a result of activities like smoking cigs to liquor and even smoking pot. I just don't see how that is bad, our society isn't perfect and humans don't always make the best decisions for themselves at least this way they aren't making it hard on all of us. Again, this is from a Canadian perspective and how our Universal healthcare works. Now the degree of tax should also be looked into based on the long term data with a couple of metric which is probably another discussion. ",
