A 15% corporate tax rate is really fucking low. This means a good portion of US based corporations which set up to take advantage of the large portion of EU skilled workers will be making to move back to America, Ireland specifically is extremely worried, as a good portion of their economy in early 80's-2000's was built around undercutting American corporate tax rates. \n\nAlso the 10% tax rate to bring overseas money from American corporations back into America will also drastically hurt the EU banks. Which is not good at all, Deutsche bank, like Lehman Brother's, took on a bunch of toxic derivatives and is on the brink of collapse. On top of all that Merkel has refused time and time again she will not bail them out if they declare bankruptcy. A major shift in liquidity heading back into US banks will surely spur a collapse. (Interestingly enough Trump owes Deutsche bank 300 million, he has a personal incentive to see them fail.)\n\nClimate aside the political elite in the EU know that, Paris deal or not, a Trump presidency will hurt them. This isn't on top of the fact that Trump seriously want's to increase EU spending on defense and essentially want's to pull out of NATO, or at the very least reduce the US's role. All these reason's are ultimately why Putin loves Trump also, Putin benefits the most from a weakened EU. \n\nThis is the EU telling the President-Elect that they have some political leverage to fight back. The EU by itself really doesn't have a chance with Trump but with the Paris Climate Pact they can also get China involved which is a whole different story. There is alot alot more going on here then just the climate. \n\nFYI not a Trump supporter. ",

Each car is around 400SF of space that developers need to find on site - often the minimums are far more than what is needed so we usually end up with massive surface lots serving small buildings.  However, if you are a developer and you want to generate more value (and, if you are a government, tax-revenue) for a site, you want to maximize leasable SF and minimize the amount of parking (as an aside, in expensive cities, hard cost for underground parking has surpassed $150k per space - you tie that to a dwelling unit and there's no way an average person can afford to live there - parking is almost always considered a loss-leader - additionally - while car infrastructure can have a lower initial cost, the long term cost maintenance per user is much higher than with other modes).\n\nTo generate more value in more places we need much greater investment in non-car modes of transportation (typically transit, walking, and biking) - which just happens to be better for the environment. The trade-off is you need to provide space for these options - something that is difficult when the government refuses to spend money on something other than cars, and the design standards ignore other modes - especially bikes and walking.\n\nWhat really bothers me is that the GOP likes to claim that transportation choice is somehow \"social engineering\" - which is bizarre because forcing everyone to drive everywhere (and forcing the back-end of this infrastructure on developers) seems more like social engineering to me.  Trump of all people knows this and is very likely why trains and subways are in his platform since it's the least cost to developers. He's not really enlightened on bikes yet - but many property owners are starting to take bikes seriously as they are much easier to find space for and provide more development opportunities in locations further away from transit.   But bikes also require safe, connected infrastructure to effectively start making an impact on car use and it's very hard politically to get people to give up a few on-street parking spaces for physically protected lanes. However - if that money starts flowing from the fed, people change their tune real quick.\n\nTL;DR - I use climate change to sell transportation choice to certain audiences.\n\nedit - I can also talk about solar and electric cars in a similar fashion.",

Putting the price [upstream](http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424127887323611604578396401965799658) where the fossil fuels enter the market makes it simple, easily enforceable, and bureaucratically lean.

Enacting a [border tax](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2026879) would protect domestic businesses from foreign producers not saddled with similar pollution taxes, and also [incentivize those countries](http://ageconsearch.umn.edu/handle/205761) to enact their own carbon tax (why would the U.S. want to lose that tax money to Europe if we could collect the revenue ourselves?) \n\n[Conservative estimates](http://rdcu.be/cLYO) are that failing to mitigate climate change will cost us 10% of GDP over 50 years. In contrast, carbon taxes may actually *boost* GDP, if the revenue is used to offset other (distortional) taxes or even just [returned as an equitable dividend](http://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2014/jun/13/how-revenue-neutral-carbon-tax-creates-jobs-grows-economy) (the poor tend to spend money when they've got it, which [boosts economic growth](https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/sdn/2015/sdn1513.pdf)). We [won\u2019t wean ourselves off fossil fuels without a carbon tax](http://news.mit.edu/2016/carbon-tax-stop-using-fossil-fuels-0224), and the [longer we wait to take action the more expensive it will be](http://rdcu.be/cZjG).\n\nSince over a hundred nations signed an agreement in Paris last year to limit emissions to 2 \u00baC (and preferably 1.5 \u00baC) the rest of the world will most likely be taxing carbon, which would give them the legal right to impose a carbon tax border adjustment on U.S. goods. It would be bad for the U.S. economy for Trump to pull out not just because of the benefits we'd lose out on by failing to institute these policies (innovation and economic growth), but because we'd basically lose revenue to other nations' border tax.\n",

By ignoring pollution, American industry would be able to undercut Europeans by reducing operating costs across the board.  In response, Europe imposes an import tax to penalize American industry for failing to abide by the agreed upon level playing field of the treaty.  Europe does this so that cheaper American products don't put European industry out of business because it suddenly becomes cheaper to import from America than it does to produce in Europe.\n\nThis is the intended purpose behind import taxes and tariffs.  Ideally, governments use it to control trade and encourage business that aids their country.  However, extra taxes reduce profits, and discourage business overall.  It's a careful balancing act.",

For example, nations could invest in high voltage DC lines to make it easier to get renewables to population centers. Nations could invest in mass transit and distributed EV charging stations to reduce carbon emissions from transportation. Nations could subsidize retrofits to reduce the heating and cooling needs of buildings. The idea is that if a nation uses the proceeds to also help cut carbon, the carbon emissions drop faster, and therefore the necessary tax to achieve the carbon cuts goes down. It's a \"pay me now or pay me later\" idea, with the understanding that for some kinds of carbon emissions reductions, a large program or single large projects can achieve carbon cuts that the market of a million smaller participants can't achieve collectively.",

Le Pen has the deck stacked against her much harder than Brexit and Trump.\n\nFrance has this system where there is an election to determine the two most popular parties, that then go head to head in a presidential election a few days later. This is useful because you can vote third party first election without wasting your vote in the second.\n\nTraditionally, this has been a right wing party (Les R\u00e9publicains) and a left wing party (Parti socialiste). However, this time Le Pen has been getting bigger, and the left wing party is tanking very hard (their current PM has like 13% approval amongst the voters) so it is very possible that Le Pen will beat the left wing and make it to the second election.\n\nWhen that happens though, she is basically screwed. The left wing party will officially support the right wing partys candidate no matter what (the french parties can actually get their shit together and fight what what they feel is the common enemy, in fact they already tried this in the regional elections in 2015, where it worked) and most voters of both parties hate Le Pen to vote against her. The hate for Le Pen is also expected to bring out non-voters to vote against her.\n\nThis can be seen in polls as well. While Trump and Brexit were both within or close to the statistical uncertainty, but Le Pen is more than 10% off, even with her better polls and best possible result within the statistical uncertainty.\n\nThis means that the person that Les R\u00e9publicains nominates as presidential candidate has basically already won. If Le Pen doesn't make it into the second election, they are also projected to beat Parti socialiste. Currently Juppe and Sarkozy are fighting for the nomination. Juppe seems to be winning, but Sarkozy isn't far behind.",

A negative externality of a factory happens when the company doesn't bear the full cost of production because it pollutes and lets others bear that cost. A carbon tax forces that firm to bear the full cost (and also leads to a higher price of the product and a lower quantity produced).\nA carbon tax is basically used to fix the market failure caused by pollution. \n\nWith climate change, because the effect is global, if the US doesnt get its act together, Europe will feel its consequences. So one way to force the US to pay its share is by imposing a tariff. A tariff is a tax charged on imports. A tariff will make US products less competitive.\n\nThe EPA has to regulate ghg emissions but the latest plan, which is for power plants is on hold until the supreme court can look at it. If the new justice is anti climate, they need a new plan.\nCongress could pass climate legislation and has tried but failed to do so. Last attempt was a long time ago.\n\nWhat to do with the tariff is up to the country. In general when countries start imposing tariffs or getting out of agreements, other countries retaliate. That is why trumps China idea is only appealing to people who don't know about hoover and smoot hawley legislation.",

While air pollution is dangerous for people in the neighborhood, carbon emissions are dangerous for future climate and are what this agreement is intended to address.\n\nMexico's carbon emissions are quite small in comparison to the U.S. They're killing their own citizens in Mexico City, but they're not a major contributor to climate change.\n\nI took a trip to Morocco a couple years ago. Lots of people there get around on two-stroke mopeds. Those things spew pollution but they don't burn much gas for every mile ridden.

I'll just throw out two: \n\n1) Crops we eat are mostly C3 plants and weeds are mostly C4 plants. Without getting into the chemistry -- C3 plants need cooler nights. This means that our crops aren't going to like \"warmer nights\" like the \"more carbon is better\" crowd thinks.\n\n2) The east coast sea level is many feet lower than the rest of the country's coastline. This is because of trade winds. If the trade winds shift, you could suddenly get an increase of many feet of water -- not having to wait for the Antarctic to drop icebergs.\n\nOK, one more; acidification of the oceans. Might have to do without fish; but what about the epic red tides that are created as more and more sea creatures perish. And the more red tides, the more the ocean chemistry will change, causing more death. It's a feedback loop scenario I don't think we want to mess with.",

That's ignoring the other states that make up the EU, and also ignoring the fact that Russia does not have any reason nor ability to invade France. \n\nWhat threat do you think makes it so we should keep up such a large agreement? No, contrary to the belief of many Americans, you do not pay for our militaries, and for our protection. Your government pays and shells out money in the form of NATO in order to influence our governments and keep us in their sphere of influence. \n\nThe nations that are under the threat of Russia and have legitimate reason to be scared are the Baltic states, which even US military generals remarked would be indefensible if Russia launched a full invasion of the states, and poland and the other Eastern European nations that are part of NATO which are also all part of the EU and would receive our protection, which as stated earlier, is more than enough against Russia. Outside of the Baltics, all of it is protected, not to mention that Russia does not border any of the NATO members outside of the Baltic states anymore anyways. \n\nYou get influence and a voice at our tables far greater than you would without NATO, we get additional security and greater cooperation across the Atlantic. If you don't like the agreement then fine, but don't pretend it's a one way relationship and that the Americans are just being good little saints protecting us. \n\n\n\nNo, the relationship that has formed because of NATO is not a parasitic one, or even a commensalistic one. It is a mutual benefit relationship. Just not in the way the Americans want, or see. \n\n",

The artillery and cavalry branches have been reduced to a skeleton. The infantry is barely holding up, but is currently affected to bullshit tasks and is slowly losing it's core competences.\n\nWe do have best-in-world advanced defense programs.
