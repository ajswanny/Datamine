US is allowed to build military bases in Qatar, increasing military readiness in the region and increasing our intelligence community's ability to perform their job. If we do not provide Qatar arms, they will go to China or Russia, and one of those countries will receive these benefits instead of the US.\n\n\n* If China/Russia receive these benefits, it will increase their influence and hold on the Middle East. This will further their objectives of reducing the influence of Western democracies across the world. This is not a good thing if you support Democracy. \n\n\n* F-15s are easily traceable. They will not fall into the hands of terrorists. The important technologies in our F-15s are stripped out of the Qatar version as well. This means there is little value if our adversaries (Russia/China) reverse engineer them.\n\n\n* Our intelligence community is aware of which officials in the Qatar gov't have ties with terrorism. This is why Trump blasted them on Friday, because he likely has already been briefed on it. Obama was aware of this when signing the deal as well.\n\n\nWith every decision comes pros and cons. I just wanted to highlight the pros of this one. Reddit can help me fill in the cons.",

Sure they're Islamists, but of a sort that want a sort of democratic Islamism a la Iran. Qatar wants to become a constitutional monarchy and likes this strain of Islamism, they're playing a long con there. The other Gulf states support ISIS type Caliphate Islamists as they're absolute monarchies and strive for a religious kingship type of deal. Qatar supporting an anti-monarchist organization not just in the Gulf region but throughout the Arab world is a big problem to the monarchs of SA, UAE, Oman and Kuwait. \n\nIn addition to this Qatar shares the largest gas bubble in the world with Iran and they sell gas through Iran. This is also problematic to the other Gulf states, in particular Bahrain as they are a classic Sunni monarchy but their population is mostly Shia as is Iran. Qatar sees how when the oil money is gone all of the peninsula is going to turn into what Yemen is right now and Iran and Turkey will be the big players again. That's long term but neither now or in the future does Qatar have a real reason to further antagonize Iran. \n\nHowever, Qatar is in a EU-type situation with the rest of the Gulf. That's where the accusations come from. The other Gulf states want Qatar out not because Qatar supports terrorism. It's because they support pro-democracy terrorism, basically. Everybody knows SA supports ISIS big time..\n\nThe US have no reason to break with the larger allies, or support Qatar which is now mostly allied with Iran. This is why Trump joins the accusations waged against Qatar.\n\nSource:, lived in Kuwait, know my Middle-East well enough. ",

The Muslim brotherhood scares the shit out of the Saudi Royals because to quote Ayatollah Khomeini \"There are no kings in Islam.\u201d They're extremely afraid of some egalitarian or generally non-monarchical political movement will crush the Saudi Royal pyramid scheme. When the brotherhood were deposed quite brutally I recall, some of them fled for Qatar.\n\n[To quote a few other reasons why the Saudis don't like Qatar:](https://www.juancole.com/2017/06/arabias-aristocratic-hegemony.html)\n\n> Qatar stands accused of using the Al Jazeera satellite t.v. station to promote the Muslim Brotherhood. (Religious Palestinians have long been important in its management and staffing). When the Muslim Brotherhood came to power in Egypt in 2011-2012, claiming Islamic authority based on its populism and elections, that posed a severe threat to the Saudi monarchy, which suddenly had a religious and not just secular rival in Egypt. The Saudi elite was afraid Brotherhood influence would come over and challenge the monarchy.\n\n> Hamas in Gaza is a distant branch of the Muslim Brotherhood (it is organized by country, so there is no common reporting line). That is one reason the Saudis dislike it and back the secular PLO.\nQatar, from Riyadh\u2019s point of view, is just not a team player. It has supported the Muslim Brotherhood and kindred movements in Egypt and Syria. It is allied with the pro-Muslim Brotherhood Turkey. Qatar\u2019s traditional policy is to keep lines open to Iran and to remain on speaking terms with the ayatollahs, while Saudi Arabia\u2019s deputy crown prince Muhammad bin Salman wants to isolate Iran, cut off its government, and kill it. Qatar is on the exact opposite side from Iran in Syria, where it supported the Muslim Brotherhood rebels, some of whom morphed into radicals. But it doesn\u2019t support the Salafis such as Jaysh al-Islam, who are backed by the Saudis.\n\n> Both Qatar and Saudi Arabia have lost in Syria to the Iran-Russia coalition. But since Qatar has no ambitions to be a regional hegemon (it is too tiny for that), they can live with that defeat and still hope to be influential among the Syrian Muslim Brotherhood-linked groups in any post-war settlement. The Saudis are furious about their defeat and inability to dislodge Iran from Syria. The Saudis are on a war footing in their quest for hegemony, and so abhor grey areas. Everything is black and white to them, and Qatar is not following that logic.",

I dun have any experience running casinos but mayb tht's what dis casino needs did u evr thinked abt that? thx.\"\n\nObviously the current CEO doesn't worry at all about this idiot but several weeks later he somehow finds himself at a board meeting to vote on who should be CEO of the casino. \"How the fuck did this happen?\" He asks himself, still convinced noone could be stupid enough to actually hand this guy the keys to place and still convinced that somehow all of this is some kind of joke, surely it can't be serious.\n\nWell, it is serious and Trump wins ownership of the casino in a close split decision and is now in charge of the casino's finances and day to day operations. Almost immediately reports come in that he is taking money directly out of the casino's business accounts and putting it directly into his own. When confronted about this by the board of directors his go to explanation is for them to stop being 'Playa Hataz'. This goes on for a couple months until present day where his actions are becoming more and more criminal on a daily basis but everyone seems to be waiting for someone else to do something about it first before they step up themselves. Meanwhile, the casino gets closer and closer to going bankrupt with each passing day as all of it's profits go directly into Trump's pockets.\n\nWill Trump ruin a once great casino? Will the board of directors stop him in time? Do I have too much free time on my hands?\n\nFIND OUT NEXT WEEK ON THE NEXT EPISODE OF DRAGONBALL Z!",

They're simple creatures, but with a very steadfast recognition of their nature and their actions, it's quite clear how their nature, with a very *deep* emphasis on their nurture, is why they are what they are. My sister's cat, who is in our house, was raised with pure affection and never punished, and because of that, it loves everyone. She will hop up on the couch and rub faces with a stranger, and walk around large groups of family during our Christmas Eve get-together or whenever. Meanwhile, the cat we have that grew up stray is afraid and under a bed. And the cat we have that was put around large dogs as a kitten is horrified and completely avoidant.\n\nPoint being, humans are exactly this simple when you tear us down to our base elements. \n\nEnd circumcision. It's a fucking detrimentally illogical practice that harms natural male bodies and introduces us to pain and irritation when we're probably in our most sensory state of learning, and this shows up in pain responses for boys who were circumcised. I was, and I'm horribly against it now.\n\nLikewise, end anything systemic that harms children physically, and provide full universal healthcare. \n\nTeach compassion over competition. End the ideological units I bring up. Each one creates a hierarchy of competition that has no actual sense to it. We don't need people to live in a constant state of stress over units of ideology. We don't need them to feel irrational pride in their righteousness/grades/wealth, or the inevitable rebelliousness that forms to oppose it. Motivation is inherent to the human animal. We don't need senseless pressures to deteriorate our minds in ways that aren't natural to basic, almost meditational, survival in wilderness. And this idea extends very deeply into each thing I mention. I believe spreading the information of *why* these things are harmful is what needs to be done in order to fully understand the unnatural and mentally damaging pressures we put on ourselves in modern society.\n\nSchooling, for example, should not involve grades. It should be a more casually enforced location for \"students\" to meet every day with a full assortment of rooms with art supplies, productive machines, technology and computers, sports equipment/areas, social settings, mentors to help students specifically to learn what they *want*, and in the process, we promote a guiltless desire to learn and have a sincere pride, without the competition, in intellectualism. And the primary focus of those mentors, through the entire thing, would be to promote exercise, health, cooperation, communication, and bring people together.\n\nHave you ever played an instrument? If so, have you ever played with someone else? I played guitar for a while. I go to a new friend's house, a guy I'm still a little uncomfortable around, and he starts playing drums. Asks me to pick up his bass and play whatever. I was afraid, but I picked it up and started playing some Brain Stew, by Green Day. The sounds synchronized and I suddenly felt naked and weird, like it was just so *strange* that we were playing together. I was all up in my head and got nervous, but it was so *cool*. We need to teach children *that feeling.* There is a pleasure in cooperation and agreement that comes naturally. \n\n>If you want to build a ship, don't drum up people to collect wood and don't assign them tasks and work, but rather teach them to long for the endless immensity of the sea.\n\nChildren raised like that, I believe, could form a world better than I could ever imagine possible.\n",

His smile seems genuine though, and when I see him interact with other comedians it almost seems like when he laughs he's breaking character and that somewhere in there is a funny fun loving guy playing a heel.\n\nHe's made a lot of valid points as well, but then he's also said a lot of really fucked up stuff... but then so has Kathy Griffin...  I dunno, I think a lot of it is just the comedy industry.  Even Kramer has bad nights & loses his shit occasionally ;)\n\nThen you have depression; tears of a clown, robin williams' situation, jim carrey's situation, richard pryor's situation, they're all surrounded in negativity a lot of the time and expected to always be funny.
