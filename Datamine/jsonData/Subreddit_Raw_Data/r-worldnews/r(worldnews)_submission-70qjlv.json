Typically, Russian submarines armed with the \"Special Weapon\" only required the captain to get authorization from the political officer to launch a nuclear torpedo. However, due to Arkhipov's position as flotilla commander, the B-59's captain also was required to gain Arkhipov's approval. An argument broke out, with only Arkhipov against the launch  \n  \n*edit* As someone pointed out, Arkhipov got indirectly honoured by being portrayed by Liam Neeson in the movie K-19:The Widowmaker. Perhaps not a \"good enough\" reward for avoiding potential nuclear war, but still, better than nothing.",

I brought up in it how it can be useful, but we should limit the extent to which we use it. I made a point of explaining why it shouldn't be used for nuclear protocol and cited a few situations similar to this one as situations where an AI might respond too drastically, depending on its programming. It's also worth noting that, while it's easy to say that putting an AI in charge of the nuclear launch would be a stupid idea and we'd never do that, we did. More specifically, the USSR had a system, known as Dead Hand in English, that was meant to function as an automatic response in the event that the Soviet government was decapitated by a US strike. Now, while it never did happen, the potential for something to go wrong was there and it's worth remembering that AI are far from perfect, regardless of how much detail we put into the programming.\n\nI went off on a bit of a tangent there, but TL;DR: We need people to watch over things. AI aren't good enough for situations where you benefit from intuition, especially when the stakes are very high, as is the case with nuclear war.",

It was a rare event of sun rays reflecting off icy clouds matching a missile launch track. It was later found to occur about once a year. At that time the system was less in a year in service in experimental mode. It wasn't supposed to be actionable at that time.\n\n\nThe system had digital lines running to the command center in another city near Moscow and to the radars run by independent military units thousand kilometers away. The information about detected launches was instantly and automatically transmitted to the radar bases and to the command center. Petrov's responsibility was actually to be a backup in case automated digital transmission fails. The radar site in Latvia at the west end of Russia was immediately put in red alert mode regardless of what Petrov said and the decision was made in the command center to wait for a radar confirmation because I said above the infrared satellite system was in experimental mode at that time. Once the radar didn't confirm an approaching missile the alert was called off.\n\n\nEDIT: another additional comment. The infrared detection method is so imprecise that it cannot provide a good estimate of trajectory. Remember that it works only while the missile engine is firing. And the infrared image is extremely low resolution 2D picture. Even after the system was deployed later in mission mode it was always used to alert radar sites and command center not actually trigger a response right away. It cannot reliably tell if a missile is just a test flying into Atlantic ocean or into Russia.",

NORAD computers then placed the number of incoming missiles at 2,200.Strategic Air Command was notified, nuclear bombers prepared for takeoff, and intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) crews were presumably placed on alert. Within six to seven minutes of the initial response, satellite and radar systems were able to confirm that the attack was a false alarm. **It was found that a training scenario was inadvertently loaded into an operational computer.** ",

Despite being in international waters, the Americans started dropping signaling depth charges, explosives intended to force the submarine to come to the surface for identification. There had been no contact from Moscow for a number of days and, although the submarine's crew had earlier been picking up U.S. civilian radio broadcasts, once B-59 began attempting to hide from its U.S. Navy pursuers, it was too deep to monitor any radio traffic. Those on board did not know whether war had broken out or not. The captain of the submarine, Valentin Grigorievitch Savitsky, decided that a war might already have started and wanted to launch a nuclear torpedo.",

He had a bad need for money as a poor and ill retirement, and he got help for now when voluntary contributions flowed in. The letters of support contained everything from grateful schoolchildren's pennies, to relatively modest $ 500 from actor Kevin Costner. \n\nPeople are inferring \"Kevin Costner gave the man $500 after starring in a movie about him\". The truth is Kevin Costner gave $500 as part of a fundraising drive, along with a letter - possibly one of many causes he donated to. A decade later the filmmaker played up this connection for the movie. It looks like RT has a pretty fitting tagline, \"Question More\".",

McNamara really drives in the point that we were at the brink of annihilation, and in a later meeting with Castro did he find that America GRAVELY underestimated how many nuclear warheads were in Cuba and how close they were to retaliation. The entire world would have been devastated, not just the two belligerents. To even think back at what Curtis Lemay was saying now is nothing short of insanity. ",

    "body": "The background is 12 days of cuban missile crisis (the incident happened on the day before it was resolved). The US fleet had imposed a naval blockade of Cuba. The US was threatening invasion; with a possible escalation to nuclear war. (which everyone on the US side - except the president - was advocating, unknown to the sub). [The US had already sponsored an invasion before - the bay of Pigs and was threatening the Castro regime (which was newish at the time)]. Headlines abounded.\n\nThe 3 submarines had orders to break the blockade ... by evading it underwater. While underwater, the subs could hide but could not communicate (similar reasons to why you can't get GPS signals in a tunnel). \n\nThe US destroyers were hunting them down and forcing them to surface, where they would be vulnerable (mission fail at the minimum). The sub was at the very edge of it's endurance (batteries running out, carbon dioxide high, heat high). And now the US destroyer is depth charging them (they were signaling depth charges, with only a small amount of explosives,- but the sub didn't know that). \n\nEvery piece of evidence they had was consistent with war.  \n\nSurfacing allows the sub to communicate but would ensure that it was detected and would be hapless before the adversary - and turned back. If it was war (\"and why would you depth charge me, if it wasn't war\"), the sub would be destroyed.\n\nEdit : You should also note that it was a tactical nuclear torpedo; one which would take out a ship, and not a city. (the fear folks had was that any nuke could lead to escalation, that would not stop there)\n\nThat's the context.\n\ntldr; The peak of the intense cuban missile crisis (12 days into it), no communications 'glitch' but expected lack of communications underwater, a depth charge attack on the sub by a US destroyer, after a naval blockade, time (battery and underwater life support) running out,  surfacing implied mission failure at best, and destruction possibly, plus this was a tactical nuke to kill the ships 'attacking' them and not a strategic city killer",

Thought this would be a casual comment that only op and a few other people would look at, gave it like 5 seconds of thought.\n\nTo ease your jimmies...\n\n# Here's some simple math... #\n\nThe surface area of land on earth is ~57,500,000 *miles^2*; ~24,700,000 *miles^2* of which is habitable.\n\nLets say the average yield of a nuke is 4-5 megatons (I'm guessing?), a blast radius of ~10 miles. So each blast covers a surface area of 314.169 *miles^2*.\n\nThe all time high of active nukes was in 1985 at 68,000.\n\n68,000 nuclear blasts * 314.16 miles^2 = **21,362,880 miles^2 covered in nuclear blasts**\n\nSo enough to: \n\n* *melt 37.2% of the surface land on Earth*\n\n* *melt nearly all habitable land*\n\nSo no, we never had enough nukes to literally melt the surface of the earth many times over, that's correct. Though, we almost had enough to melt the only parts we care about? \u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af\n\nTake this math and be happy \u0ca0_\u0ca0\n____\n# Here's another fun one... #\n\n**Average temperature of Ocean water:** ~4.4 \u00b0C\n\n**Boiling point of sea water:** ~102 \u00b0C\n\n**Specific heat of sea water:** ~4 kJ/(kg*\u00b0C)\n\n**Water in ocean:** ~1.37 * 10^21 kg\n\n**Energy needed to evaporate the Oceans:** 4 kJ/(kg\u00b0C) * 1.37*10^21 kg * (102-4.4)\u00b0C = 5.348*10^23 kJ\n\n...\n\n**Heat energy from nuclear blast (~50% of total):** 10,460,000,000 kJ\n\n10,460,000,000 kJ * 68,000 total = 7.1128*10^14 kJ total\n\nThat's enough to completely evaporate... **0.00000000133%** of Earth's oceans, land untouched.\n\nSo if the nukes ever start flying, head for the bottom of the ocean... \n",

Its possible to do both. That's what the Allies did in WWII's aftermath. While they did rebuild the defeated nations and formed close economics ties, they also ruled absolutely for about a decade in both Japan and West Germany. The USA essentially wrote Japan's Constitution. Both countries were also occupied for decades. The British Army of Occupation, for example, did not leave Germany until the end of the Cold War.\n ",

Germany on the other hand suffered a complete collapse of her government.
