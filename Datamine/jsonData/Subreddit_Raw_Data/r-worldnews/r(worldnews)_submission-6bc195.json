    "body": "Depends what you mean by \"Canada\".  The current governing Liberal party?  They're certainly a lot more left wing in American's imaginations than they are in real life.  For starters, as an Australian, you guys have proportional representation in your senate I believe, right?  Well our PM Trudeau campaigned on a promise that \"This will be the last ever FPTP election in Canada\".  \n\nThen he basically said \"Oh shit you guys thought I meant proportional representation?  Lol no, I think that would bring about a dystopian nightmare, no I meant IRV ranked ballots\".  And then when the committee concluded that IRV ranked ballots is even worse than FPTP, he said \"Fine, nobody gets anything then\", and scrapped the whole promise, citing fears about PR that were disproven with expert testimony and evidence in his own committee.  \n\nIf you're an environmentalist, you might be a little pissed at how the government's stance on pipelines seems to be \"Get that oil out of the ground, we'd be stupid not to\", and not \"Pipelines are bad\", which for some reason some people got the impression that's what he'd think.  \n\nMaybe you're a scientist, sick of all the anti-science and evidence denial in politics.  Our previous government, Stephen Harper, became infamous for actually muzzling publicly employed scientists from basically saying anything in public without government approval - if a geologist who worked for Environment Canada went on CBC to talk about global warming, without getting the government's approval first, they'd be fired.  Well Trudeau promised to end that.  They didn't really - they just selectively allowed *some* departments to talk freely - the ones whose findings they're not terribly worried about.  They also promised to actually start listening to science and expert consensus, instead of the previous governments that would pick and choose whatever science they could find that was convenient for them, but the aforementioned decision on proportional representation seems to prove they're not fans of expert consensus either.\n\nIf you're a young person sick of corruption and cronyism in politics, you might be a little annoyed at the \"cash for access\" program, where anyone wealthy enough to afford tickets to a fancy dinner for a few thousand dollars can buy the ear of any of the important ministers, or the PM himself.  Basically in-person lobbying.  Or how he continually seems to take vacations with wealthy billionaires.  He was raised very rich, after all.\n\nIf you're in favour of legalizing pot, you might be annoyed at how it appears to be taking 100x longer than it took the Canadian government to legalize alcohol at the end of its prohibition - they keep reassuring us that \"these things are complicated and take time\", but it really seems that they're trying to line it up to be legalized and ultimately available in stores just months before the next election.  It also appears they're trying to shut out small business and enforce large distribution laws to try to create a cannabis oligopoly, similar to the telecom industries in the US and Canada.\n\nMy own personal impression is that voters thought they were electing a Bernie Sanders-type character, but instead got more of a Hillary Clinton type character.  But he's so much better than Stephen Harper.  And looks great in comparison to Donald Trump.  Our bar has been set so low that people are willing to forgive all of this.  And forget the fact that we have another, 3rd left wing option.  I think our version of The Daily Show, Rick Mercer, summed up Trudeau and his relationship with Trump quite well:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ti5e6Rh_I3E",

When they do have partisan wrangling its over annoying shit like \"Hey did Trudeau elbow this woman?\" (No joke) which for as irritating as it may seem is ultimately harmless.  Our mainstream conservatives support gay marriage,  abortion, universal healthcare, refugees and immigration.  I guess when a party's principles and values are derived from a constructive mentality they are open to compromise when presented with evidence. We had issues in the Harper years of the Republicanization of his party but I'm glad evidence based policy is a thing again.  \n\n*I should add a caveat that for sure you can find examples of MPs who oppose some of the issues I listed above but in our system its much harder for a Freedom Caucus equivalent to exist. Vast majority of Canadians support these issues so their party makes them shut up and not reopen the debate.",

I'd put it down to three things, an insanely high importance on education (e.g., our teachers are all paid extremely well), a strong legal framework that places a high value on human rights and a hard-to-pin-down notion of Canadian values, in which everyone should be respected and we should help people in difficulty if we can. \n\nI should add that I don't think we're unique in any of this, and I consider a few of our Scandinavian friends to be our ideological cousins.\n\nEdit: One of my favourite 'This is Canada' moments: http://www.cc.com/video-clips/skmxbz/the-daily-show-with-trevor-noah-exclusive---prime-minister-justin-trudeau-welcomes-syrian-refugees-to-canada",

It's likely constitutional and doesn't punish regional parties.  The NDP and Green however aren't willing to compromise and the Conservatives don't want electoral reform at all.

Otherwise every party would just change the rules to suit them when they're in power. He ran the surveys and I know people didn't like how they formed the questions, but at least we took that step.

Trudeau never once said he was against pipelines, in fact he was very open about being *for* pipelines. Would you rather the oil be shipped by rail (much larger spills) or just up and abandon the oil sands? If it's the latter, I would love to hear how you would make up for the massive dent in our economy and Alberta jobs. Also as an environmentalist, Trudeau isn't just sitting on his ass.

It's a way to fight the rampant greenhouse effect and it's worked well everywhere else that it's been implemented. \n\nAlso I'll admit I didn't know much about carbon tax until a few minutes ago, so I read up on it in wikipedia: \n\n> Carbon tax offers social and economic benefits. It is a tax that increases revenue without significantly altering the economy while simultaneously promoting objectives of climate change policy. The objective of a carbon tax is to reduce the harmful and unfavorable levels of carbon dioxide emissions, thereby decelerating climate change and its negative effects on the environment and human health.[6]\n\n>Carbon taxes offer a potentially cost-effective means of reducing greenhouse gas emissions.[7] From an economic perspective, carbon taxes are a type of Pigovian tax.[8] They help to address the problem of emitters of greenhouse gases not facing the full social cost of their actions. Carbon taxes can be a regressive tax, in that they may directly or indirectly affect low-income groups disproportionately. The regressive impact of carbon taxes could be addressed by using tax revenues to favour low-income groups. [...] Many large users of carbon resources in electricity generation, such as the United States,[11][12] Russia, and China, are resisting carbon taxation.\n\nWhat are your concerns? ",

    "body": "How did we get into the state we're in? Well, it's a heady mixture of classism and abstinence-only thinking. \n\nDuring the 19th century drug and alcohol abuse was rampant. You could buy cocaine at the corner shop. You could buy opium for a headache and laudanum to help you sleep. Everyone drank. All the time. People used to be known as a \"two bottleman\" because he drank two bottles of wine with his meal, and no serious contender to become a politician would dream of being anything less than a \"three bottleman\". I know this is going back another century, but it still gives you an idea of just how much people used to drink. In 1758 George Washington supplied 28 gallons of rum, 50 gallons of rum punch, 34 gallons of wine, 46 gallons of beer and 2 gallons of cider royal to just 391 people during an election, and thought perhaps he had offered drink too \"sparingly\".\n\nThe Temperance Movement grew steadily throughout the 19th century in an attempt to stop the nationwide lack of sobriety. At one point they even advocated people switch to cannabis as it didn't make people violent and could be grown at home - eliminating the two primary problems of alcohol and other drugs, violence and cost. Millions of people saw their families destroyed by drugs and drink and vowed not to do it themselves, and instilled that in their children as well. Not one drop, no moderation, just complete abstinence. It was the only solution they could see to the society-wide damage. And the movement got popular. Really, stunningly popular.\n\nAt the same time, the on-going mechanisation of the nation was incompatible with a nation of drunks and drug users. The machines of industry needed men who operated with the same efficiency and reliability as the metal mechanisms they operated. They also advocated for drugs, briefly. They would give out cocaine and amphetamines for free to help people work cheerfully and without tiring - until they realised that people became addicts and addicts were just as unreliable as drunks. Even just being hung-over could threaten the reliability of the machines. Better to ensure they had only sober employees. \n\nSo the two factors come together. The Temperance Movement explodes in popularity creating an entire generation of the middle and lower classes who believe that alcohol and other mind altering substances should be entirely and utterly abstained from, and a wealthy upper class who have good economic cause to want their workers to abstain from any and all mind altering substances. Sober men could get a high paying job with Ford, while a drunk would be stuck on his farm, or have no job at all. It created a self-fulfilling prophecy for the Temperance movement that drunks would never prosper. \n\nThis creates a society were the drunk and the druggie are demonised. And its self perpetuating. There are no longer industrial reasons to want a sober society but there are still economic reasons for the wealthy elite to maintain their war on drugs. There is also a lingering social fear of descending into the drunken, drug-fueled haze that came before. Even if it is rarely actualised into thought, it is felt. The old stereotypes of the town drunk, or the pothead stoner refuse to go away.\n\nMy personal hope is that the recent push into understanding mental health will help prevent us falling into that old society where the man of the house got drunk every night just as the lord of the manor smoked opium, to drown out the demons in their mind. \n\nEdit: This is of course, a simplification. Entire volumes have been written about the history of alcohol and drug use. There were many factors that led us to where we are, but I consider these to be the two primary reasons. ",

What probably does happen, and happens across the country, is having a known substance abuse problem makes it harder to get opiates from a family practice doctor or pain management clinic and means that they're going to be more suspicious and need to monitor you more closely. But not getting pain meds ever again? That's torture in so many cases. If you come to the ER after rolling your car and your drug urine screen came up positive for cocaine, or meth, or heroine, or any other drug or combination or drug on your possession, those doctors still need to treat you for your pain from your injuries. It's going to be harder to treat you if you have a history of substance abuse, because the drugs don't work quite as well because of tolerance issues. But to not treat you is ridiculous and makes it much harder for you to get out of bed, work with PT, keep your blood pressure and heart rate under control, and get out of the hospital in a reasonable amount of time.
