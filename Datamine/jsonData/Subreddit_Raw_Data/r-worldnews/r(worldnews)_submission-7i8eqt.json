In other words, you don't keep them locked up unless you legitimately believe that they'll have the resources to flee after posting bail, or you're afraid that the serial murderer will go murder another person while out.\n\nHell, prior to the 1980's, federal law only allowed them to withhold bail if you were a flight risk. It wasn't until the mid '80s that the \"or an imminent danger to the community\" part was added. This opened it up so violent offenders, repeat offenders, crimes with especially high maximum sentences, etc could be held without bail. And even then, there is a meeting with a judge specifically to decide whether or not bail can be withheld - The judge needs to classify them into one of those specific groups in order for bail to legally be withheld.\n\nSo, in this case, (at least in the US,) they absolutely could be held without bail; They're all repeat offenders of violent crimes, and could legitimately pose a risk to the community if released on bail. But, considering the fact that Malta will have different laws (and that the judge could very well be one of those corrupt people the reporter was reporting on,) it's not really surprising that they're out.",
