The thing is Trump won in a few states that were within the margin of error, and thanks to the US electoral college system, that was enough. There was a concept called the \"blue wall,\" where given prior electoral performance, it was difficult to think that Wisconsin, Ohio, Michigan, and Pennsylvania would ALL go Republican. But they did, and took Florida with them.\n\nOne of the biggest issues was using the likely voter methodology, ~~because Trump did inspire a lot of first-time voters~~^1, moreso than the models were giving him. This meant that those margin-of-error states were not as solid as most major polling models had them, and why betting market models (like David Rothschild's PredictWise) were somewhat critical of 538's model, which had Trump with the best chances.\n\nIt's also important to remember that a 66-34% chance or a 75-25% chance (where the Trump/Clinton matchup sat most of the time) means in either 1/3 to 1/4 of the matchups, Trump wins. Our election night have Trump less-than-ideal chances, but not impossible chances. Everything that needed to happen for a Trump EC victory just happened -- in the \"blue wall\" states (and Florida) first-time rural voters were energized and came out, and traditional Democratic constituencies did not turn out in great enough numbers in those states to win, whereas in other states, Clinton was an almost overwhelming victor (like California), giving her a large popular vote margin, but a relatively weak EC map.\n\n^1 retracted statement",

This is a great summary, and I'd just add that the Founding Fathers did in fact *try* a very EU-like system of government way back in 1776 with our first constitution via the [Articles of Confederation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Articles_of_Confederation). Basically they gave the federal government (called the Continental Congress at the time) extremely little power and no chief executive head (no President). This was based primarily out of the fear early Americans had about being governed and taxed by a faraway power (having just exited the Revolutionary War); thus they wanted their government localized where it was accessible.\n\nPretty soon after (1787), after a series of events including an [armed rebellion in Virginia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shays%27_Rebellion) people realized that a bunch of little states all competing with each other over everything with basically no federal/national oversight didn't work quite as great as it sounded, and they added in things like a chief executive (President), a federal court system and federal taxation powers in 1789.\n\n",

So when the leaks came, people were already primed for it, so many accepted it.\n\nWhereas in France there were very little attacks against Macron, because quite frankly nobody thought he'd do that well.
