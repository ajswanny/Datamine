He had his right leg forward and he was standing with his left leg back. He was holding up to his left shoulder a long automatic machine gun \u2013 I saw it had a magazine beneath it.*\n\n>>*Everything he was wearing was tight, either boots or shoes and the trousers were tight, the jumper he was wearing was tight, no zippers or collars. Everything was toned black.*\n\n>>*If you think of what a combat soldier looks like, that is it \u2013 just without the webbing. Just a man in military uniform, black jumper, black trousers, black shoes or boots and a machine gun. Maybe a woolly hat.*\n\n>>*He was left-handed and shooting in bursts of three or four shots. It was fully intentional, professional bursts of three or four shots.*\n\n>>*He killed three or four individuals who were sitting in the chairs in front of the cafe. We saw them get shot down. They fell off their chairs on to the ground.*\n\n>>*He then swivelled and shot through a car driver\u2019s window.*\n\n>>*We then saw him walk into the cafe. He swivelled right and then swivelled left and opened fire. That is when we dived for cover.*\n\n>>*We heard a total of maybe 15 or 20 shots, then everything went quiet.*\n\nJesus.",

The groups market an agenda of defending an Islam that is ostensibly under attack by the state. He said such disillusioned youth are more susceptible to being persuaded to join a \u201cbigger cause.\u201d    \n\n* [\"Young Muslims lag behind in two-speed France\"](http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/2d00f9ee-9d6b-11e4-8946-00144feabdc0.html) (Financial Times):\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;    \n>Madani Cheurfa, an academic at Sciences Po in Paris, argues that the widespread availability of the internet also differentiates young Muslims from their parents, providing an open channel for those who, often frustrated and feeling rejected by their own country, discover extreme religious views that address their alienation and criticise their parents\u2019 way of life.\n&nbsp;    \n\n* [\"Crisis in France Is Seen as Sign of Chronic Ills\"](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/15/world/europe/crisis-in-france-is-seen-as-sign-of-chronic-ills.html?_r=0) (New York Times):\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;    \n>Nearly everyone agreed that the fallout from the Charlie Hebdo attacks, including a heightened security response by France and its allies, was a distraction from a larger problem: a sense of increasing social and economic marginalization that many cited as a root cause of young people drifting toward extremism.\n\n&nbsp;    \n\n*ETA: Altered to say \"European Union\" to deter confluence with Russia's experience with its own Islamic population.

Even if you are able to \"reinterpret\" these (and many more) passages to mean something more benign, it should still be apparent that not all muslims do the same - as evidenced by all of the senseless killings occurring in the name of allah. I don't know how to stop jihad, but I do know that we will never get to that point if we can't even bring ourselves to honestly describe what is happening. Muslim extremists are not extreme in how they interpret their religious texts. They are actually just doing what the book says. The only thing extreme about this are the words in the Quran, and the fact that a human being is actually capable of living by those words. Any person or idea that is immune to criticism has the potential to be very dangerous. Islam falls into this category. These jihadists TRULY believe that they are doing the right thing. Can we admit that beliefs guide behaviors? Can we admit that the plethora of terror attacks we have in this world are the RESULT of true belief in the canon of Islam? People are DYING and we are so worried about hurting feelings that we won't even let ourselves TALK openly about the root of the problem.",

    "body": "This is the story post from a redditor in /r/france\n\n\nI was in the bataclan tonight.\n I went home an hour ago but I can't find sleep anyway. I don't got the full story, the situation quickly made that we didn't had any visibility on the terrorists objectives, the room, etc. I give my feelings, \"my\" version.\n When we heard \"fireworks\", I was in the pit close to the stairs when terrorists entered and i directly ran towards the scene on the right side, by reflex. In my \"space\", everybody was wrapped around in non-probable positions et painful for everybody, face against the floor, the head set on anything close, a leg for exemple. With on the bottom a bloodbath. And it's how the worst game i every played began. The waiting game. An harmful silence in the room only broken by erratic gunshots. No timers, no logic, nothing. Just, sometimes, a gunshot. And you're wondering if the next shot is for you.\n Waiting the arrival of the police, without any notion of time (no watch, cellphone unreachable). Feel people stand up to get slaughter immediately. And again, and again... No right to move because a single movement rise the pains -yours and the other ones (we were really wrapped up). No right to walk, to whisper, nothing. Somebody start crying? This person is welcomed by collectives \"ssshhh\". Terrorists didn't said anything, except at the beginning something about Syria, Hollande (our president) and the fact that it was only the beginning. At the start, they're \"exploring\" the location, shooting randomly lying people. Then we didn't see them. Then we heard gunshots. Impossible to stand up quickly and to run away from me, all my muscle are asleep and no way to have a view of the room without potentially cross a terrorist eyes, a chance i didn't dare to take. I bet everything on the police. \nWe say to ourselves that in a case like that, the whole army should be running even the Charles-de-Gaulle (our aircraft ship) on the Seine, that somebody if going to enter and do something. We obviously have no idea of the simultaneous events in R\u00e9publique and the Stade de France. And nobody comes. Gunshots continue. And we keep waiting, playing lottery with the terrorists. With awful thoughts like: \"please, not me, aim the other side of the room\". These thoughts are interrupted by gunshots\n. At a moment (let say the \"middle\"?My time notion is more than corrupted), an explosion blew. By other witnesses, it's a grenade they threw on the pit. I can't confirm, only that it was an explosion. And that's when the waiting game take an other side. They got explosives. Fanatics armed with explosives without revendication... Your brain as the gift to directly think of the worst: we aren't a trade value. I'm naturally wondering if the goal isn't simply to blow the whole building or at least us. The waiting isn't the same at all. Time become longer. Pain intensified. People panics/suffers more and more. Phone rings more and more because close relatives try to have news, an other stress bringer (no noise!). We're looking to comfort in eyes-games with the few people we see to finally find the same fear. \nWhere is the police? What is she doing? We start to really desperate interiorly. Finally, somebody whispers \"police is here\". Then everything change. Time become even more longer because she doesn't intervene right away (scouting, etc). At this time I think that terrorists went up somewhere in the bataclan because policemen came in without shooting. Then a herd of policemen come in. When standing up, helping other to stand up, seeing policemen in armor storm the bataclan... It was an undescriptible release. We're looking to each other, blessed to be alive. We stay obviously cautious. Police doesn't know if terrorist are with us or elsewhere (I couldn't tell). \n\nFinally they went elsewhere according to intel. We start walking, hands in the head, closely happy interiorly. It's again quickly stopped by THE vision of NIGHTMARE. Dozens of bodies, people agonizing, a sea of blood in the pit. Awful. Horrible. I look the zone in which I was before running to the bottom and I see several bodies. It could have been easily me. I go out quickly, still having my hands on the head, seeing the entrance personnel of the bataclan lying on the floor (the \"fireworks\" we heard before terrorist came in). A few steps and I collapse. A torrent of tears. I don't even remember last time I cried before tonight, but no way i stop. I'm shaking. But i'm alive. Finally, we are regrouped in caf\u00e9s of the next street, blessful to had make it and take our cellphones to give some news. And we learn about all the other things. R\u00e9publique, Stade de France, etc. What a fucking pity. All this for what? I don't bring any essential news through this text but it feel good. It's \"frustating\" to be in the event and be helpless, stay face on the ground/leg/arm/etc. During 2-3 hours not helping.\nTranslation stop here. I hope I delivered the same emotion.",

They seemed to be in very close quarters with the terrorists. Unsure source.*\n\n- *18 people dead.* \n\n- *11:15 PM GMT +1 2 dismembered bodies have been found near an explosion site. Gas canister found on the pavement. A pedestrian received a bolt (frag) in his phone, confirming it most likely is a make-shift bomb.*\n\n- *\"This is for Syria!\" heard from a terrorist during an attack. France previously took part in the bombing of Syria, these terrorist attacks most likely being a retaliation.*\n\n- *\"The making of a kamikaze\" said a journalist on TV talking about one of the bombing attack. Unsure source.*\n\n- **RAID (equivalent [FBI RHT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostage_Rescue_Team)) started operating on the Bataclan hostage situation, apparently 4 terrorists taken down so far, no more details. Operation is either still on or already finished.** Side note, we have one of the most efficient task force in the world, I fucking admire them. To illustrate their actual efficiency, they're basically Batmans.\n\n- *00:45 AM GMT +1 Almost an hour old news though, highest threat level reached, the president announced the shut down of vehicle circulation in Paris, the authorization of control and search (ceasing) on any citizen by police forces, and the shut down of frontiers.*\n\n- **00:55 GMT +1 \"One of my unofficial but very sure source\" says the RAID assault on Bataclan is over, and there are tenths (multiple 10s) of deaths inside ; said a journalist on TV**.\n\n- *01:40 AM GMT +1* **For the whole night, the last death count is at least 118 people**\n\n_\n\n\n- 2 AM GMT  +1 11/14 **24 hours later 129 dead, 352 injured.** It's a calm night outside Paris, mostly mourning, grieving and anger, you can see candles by the windows in the streets in support to Paris.\n\n- **Dad and brother of identified kamize (1 out of 3) detained by the police for interrogation. Another father of a second kamikaze is also being interrogated. This french kamikaze has been identified by finger prints from a severed finger.**\n\n- Thanks to cameras in Paris, two vehicles have been identified, leading to another suspect. **This new suspect has been controlled near the Belgium border in a third vehicle with two other people in it. This is the third arrest in the case.**\n\n- **Two suspects apparently crossed Greece to come in Europe and are wanted by the police forces. A Syrian passport has been found near the stadium, a 25 year old male, unknown from the police.**\n\n- The terrorist attacks are said to have been perpetrated by three coordinated groups dispatched to the attack areas.\n\n- There is said to be 8 suspects in yesterdays attacks.\n\n- France has asked Belgium for help and intelligence gathering, the suspect trail is leading to a jihadist cell in Belgium which would've helped prepare the attacks.\n\n- **French PM \"We are at war against the islamic state.\"** Marine Le Pen extreme right politician \"We need to deport the imams extremists from french soil.\" Very stong and martial speech heard in the right wings of the government. \n\n_\n\n*Written before the edits* PS : **I need to state my opinion on the whole thing cause I'm mad**, this is clearly a coordinated terrorist attack, I'd say muslim extremists, similar group (same motives) or even same to the one that brought the January 6th attacks. I'm fucking pissed of this shit man, sorry for cursing and all but damn, why the hell doing this, and a hostage situation ? Jesus. \n\nPS 2 : Why I mean in 'why doing this' is not about the cause and effect (bombing in Syria and retaliation from ISIS), I mean it as 'why do bad shit'. Anyway, fuck this in a general way. Spread love, educate yourself, try to enlighten others, and stay clear in your head. Man we're on a rock drifting in space, take perspective and don't waste time on anger. ",
