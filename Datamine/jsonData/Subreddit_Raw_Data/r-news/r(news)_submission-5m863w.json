A crime of passion that happens to include racial or other slurs should not constitute a hate crime.\n\nFor example, someone gets into a bar fight and in the moment calls someone something derogatory based on protected status, that is not what the law is about.\n\nIt is designed to protect people from being targeted. This fits the bill, and I am in no way saying it doesn't, but I also see a lot of discussion that is worrisome regarding hate crimes where people seem to think that if race is involved at all, it qualifies.",

Also many do hear things being said about \"the poor disabled\" and end up noticing discrepancies in the treatment between the regular students and themselves.\n\nWe are aware of the divide, even those with mental disabilities. Students often get depressed due to the loneliness and self-esteem issues, some act out trying to disassociate themselves with special needs program to look normal, which makes them fake their educational levels and pretend all kinds of stuff, very demotivated to learn because there is no exit. They will never be normal or as good, is what they hear.\n\nIf you are in school and have special needs program, say hi or something. Maybe invite them to basketball or such.

After a night of drinking, while I slept, he took my card and walked to MY bank (roughly 2 blocks) and withdrew cash...twice!  It just so happened that one day we had planned on going out after work, stopped off at my place...got on my computer and checked my balance and was like wtf are these 2 withdrawals?  He straight up asked me if I'd gotten drunk and withdrew the money. Contacted my bank (still clueless he was responsible) and they investigated.  Got a phone call, at work, saying they had pics from the ATM at the time of withdrawals and wanted me to come in.  I let everyone (the work freinds) know what's up and was heading there first thing after work.  The mf'er never said anything.  I went to the bank, they showed me the pictures and asked \"do you recognize this person?\" I said yes and they gave me two options. Try to recuperate the money or file charges (there was a deadline).  I gave him until like a few days before the deadline to repay me.  The very last day, before my deadline, he slid an envelope under my door.  I haven't seen the dude's face since I went to the bank to look at the pictures.  ",

When I was a young adult (see: 2004 - 2011 if we're being generous), stupid mistakes included getting drunk and going to class with a hangover, smoking pot in my dorm, not completing an assignment on time,  or letting my phone ring in class. Other stupid mistakes I can conceive of would be asking a policeman to hold your beer while you search for your license and registration during a traffic stop, sending a Reply-All for a personal communication between two people, or locking your keys in the car.\n\nStealing a car is not a stupid mistake. Luring a mentally challenged kid into it is not a stupid mistake. Tying up said kid is not a stupid mistake. Involving a handful of friends is not a stupid mistake. Cutting someone is not a stupid mistake. Beating them is not a stupid mistake. Rubbing a lit cigarette in their wounds is not a stupid mistake. Live-streaming the whole thing for a national audience is not a stupid mistake. Releasing a mentally challenged individual who is wearing only shorts into Chicago alone during winter is not a stupid mistake.\n\nThe only stupid mistake here is that, approximately 18 years ago, four men failed to wear condoms, and as a result, these shitheads were convinced. \n\n*Edit*: I spelt conceived as convinced.

And in turn he would steal, lie, and threaten to get what he wanted. At one point he chased my mom around our yard threatening to kill her with a 2x4. That was when I could no longer see him as someone who I cared about like I once did. I still love him, and wish the best for him but so many times he's \"cleaned up\" and he's \"back\" but he just keeps going back to his old ways. He's been rehabilitated for several years now but those years of hard drugs have done permanent damage to his mind. He's not the same brother I remember playing need for speed with when I was 8, and I wouldn't and haven't hesitated to articulate to people that he's not a good person.

When I was a young adult (see: 2004 - 2011 if we're being generous), stupid mistakes included getting drunk and going to class with a hangover, smoking pot in my dorm, not completing an assignment on time, or letting my phone ring in class. Other stupid mistakes I can conceive of would be asking a policeman to hold your beer while you search for your license and registration during a traffic stop, sending a Reply-All for a personal communication between two people, or locking your keys in the car.\n\nI, too, have done stupid mistakes like these. Them others you listed, nope. I guess I'm really, really smart not to be a sadistic psychopath.",

You see these guys always say \"I'm trying to turn my life around. I'm trying to be a better dad to my kids.\" But they always end up going back to jail. They end up selling drugs, getting in fights, not actually changing their lives at all. But they get caught, and the script comes out. \"I'm gonna do it this time. I'm gonna change. I'm trying.\"\n\nNo you're not. Saying you're going to change is not you changing. Saying you're trying is not trying. *Actions* matter. Words don't mean shit.\n\nWatch the show COPS to see the mentality. You'll have  guys caught red-handed selling drugs, with crack pipes and drugs *on them* and they'll say with a straight face \"I didn't do nothin'!\" You have guys caught red-handed robbing a house. The police will literally barge INTO the house, catch them *inside*, *with* stolen materials, and the first thing they say? \"I didn't do nothin'!\" They'll get caught after the police chased them in a stolen car. \"I didn't do nothin'!\"\n\nSomebody taught a generation of kids that words matter more than actions. Somebody believed their kid over the teacher when they got in trouble at school. Then they believed their kid over the cops when they got picked up for shoplifting. They taught their kids that people will believe them if they can make themselves a sympathetic character. Unfortunately for them, part of a police officer's job is to see through sympathy acts.",

Then the law punishes their victims, as backwards as anything I can think of. We are all a sprained knee away from becoming heroin addicts. \n\nEdit: It's technically wrong that we are all a knee injury away, my point was that people often don't know how they are going to react to such drugs or what level of addict they may be. I'm also not saying every doctor who prescribed these drugs are bad, we just live in a society where the only mistake folks make is to increase their dose to walk a little easier and they are sentenced to the life of a drug addict and lose everything. We have such a stigma about folks going into rehab that it is easier to try and treat your own addiction in secret than to seek professional help. If you are willing to say \"I've taken those drugs and I didn't abuse them, that's what they get.\" You need to work on your empathy and spend more time putting yourself in other people's shoes before you judge them. I'm constantly amazed at how selfish people are and how unwilling they are to help another person. Does it allow people to feel superior knowing that they don't have those problems? I just don't understand the resistance people have to helping addicts and not treating them like criminals. ",
