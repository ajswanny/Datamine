Once the summer help had been there for a few weeks we'd buddied up with the more seasoned workers and started taking their smoke breaks with them, not smoking just hanging out and chatting. Eventually the project manager happened by and asked what we were all doing, they're like \"Smoke break, and it only seemed fair these guys take a breather too.\" He goes \"Whatever\" and didn't say anything then but quietly started assigning non-smokers to indoor and finishing jobs and smokers to jobs either outdoors or in the pre-drywall buildings where there was no reason they couldn't have a cig and keep working.

This not only meant that non-smokers ended up doing the majority of the work, but also that all of the smokers got favoritism because they spent literally hours a day hanging out with middle management.\n\nAlmost enough to convince a healthy young guy to take up smoking.",

My LPO, a smoker, just could not understand why we felt entitled to the same amount of extra break time that the smokers were getting.

Original post is now in the quote below.**\n\n>[Another Japanese CEO took a massive pay cut, dropped all his benefits, and started riding the bus to work to keep from firing more employees.](http://www.wdrb.com/story/9283503/japanese-airline-president-and-ceo-shares-the-pain) A basic tenet of Confucianism is filial piety, which at it's most basic form says that the parents take care of the children, so the children will also take care of their parents. This has been translated into political and economic life, so it can be read a little more like this: The powerful will take care of the weak, so the weak should also take care of the powerful.\n\n>CEOs take care of their employees, and in response, employees give their best.\n\n>It's an abuse-able agreement for certain, as has been seen throughout history, but generally speaking this is credited as being one of the reasons that the pay and wealth disparity is much lower in Japan than the US.\n\nEDIT: A few people have said this, but before idolizing confucianism we do have to acknowledge that when I say \"It's an abuse-able agreement\" I really mean \"It is an agreement actively being abused.\" Powerful people can and do frequently abuse this understanding. It has contributed to a host of issues, not the least of which is the infamous workaholic work culture of Japan. This is a real problem, not to be discounted, dismissed, nor made light of.\n\nEDIT2: Additionally, I did not mean to imply that this was the sole reason for lower wealth gaps. There are many others. But this is an underlying principle to Japanese culture that does curb some of the excesses of capitalistic ventures. The bankers in the US would have been social pariahs, as would their children and grandchildren. The long term payout of \"Fuck you, got mine, PEACE!\" would have been very small, as they would have been ostracized even if they got off without criminal charges like they did here in the US.",

At times an eight hour shift had no breaks at all for me while the smokers would have them all through the day.  They would just drop what they were doing and go.  I would then have to pick up the slack.  Some were worse than others.  Then of course they would come back smelling absolutely awful.  As a customer I hate being served by a smoker who recently smoked.  My state outlawed smoking in restaurants years ago, one of the best things they ever did.  \n\nIn the professional world now I will see people go out to smoke an hour before the end of the day.  But in reality it kills the last 90 minutes of productivity.  \"Oh, it is almost smoke time, better stop what I am doing and just goof off for a bit.\"  Then of course the 10 minute break is closer to 30.  So they get back with 30 minutes to go \"Oh man, only 30 minutes left, might as well not start on anything else since it will just get interrupted with quitting time\".  Might as well have just sent these people home 90 minutes early.  Same would happen leading up to lunch.  They blow 3 hours of productivity because of two 10 minute smoke breaks.  They then cry about how they dont have time to get all their stuff done and want to pass it on to other people.  ",

The smokers on the night shifts were way too liberal with their breaks, even after repeated reminders that they were there to work. At one point we were backed up during the bar rush and I had nobody in the kitchen because they all decided to go for a smoke during the busiest point of the night, so I locked them out and took over the kitchen myself. They were pissed off, banging on the doors the entire time (so it was ten degrees below freezing, that's not going to kill you, I know for sure one of them had truck keys because that's where they smoke). Once the rush cleared out I handed them their stuff through the drive thru window and told them to go home and take it up with the store manager in the morning.\n\nI'd rather have no staff than unreliable staff. Smoke breaks were a strict 15 minutes twice a shift at pre-approved times after that, same as the coffee break time all the other workers got.\n\n*Edit because people are confused: this was at 2am, the lobby had been shut down since 11pm as it was a drive thru only overnight location so they couldn't just come in the front door. And I wasn't expecting this to blow up this much, so to quell the hate mail I'll just say this wasn't the first incident with my overnight employees abusing smoke breaks, and I'd received numerous complaints about fairness from the non-smoking staff. This is how I chose to handle it, nuance and situation aside, feel free to come up with some imaginary situation in which your hypothetical response is objectively better. Unfortunately I have better things to do this afternoon than defend how I handled a stressful situation over a decade ago to a bunch of wound up strangers on the internet, so I'm done here.*",

The same for late-night dinner and drinking sessions -- if you would rather go home to spend time with your family (or by yourself) instead of boozing with the boss there's always a chance that it will reflect poorly on your 'work ethic' when it comes time to pick the next manager.\n\nHere are a couple of examples from someone who puts in late hours working at a Korean company:  \nhttps://np.reddit.com/r/korea/comments/78zxhb/advise_should_i_quite_my_korean_office_job/doy8kdi/\n\n>Another example. Quarterly earnings report is to be presented at a meeting the next day in the morning. Need to put together the presentation for the report. I need sales data from other departments so I put in a request to the accounting department. They got other stuff they think is more important than what I requested. I politely ask them a few times when it can be done by. They give some half-assed response like by 3pm. Around 3:15pm I get ask for an update and they say it will be sometime today. They have been busy with other stuff. My presentation for the report is nearly complete and I need their data so I can break it down into charts and add commentary. I ask my department head to \"push\" them. They reply they are busy with task directly ordered by the CEO. I do other works and finish them by 6pm. I wait from 6pm to 9pm when the accoutning department finally send me the data I need. I spend 9pm to 12am going through their data (which is just a bigass excel file with no labels) and extrapolate what they mean and pull useful information. Of course, accounting left already do I can't ask them a damn thing.",

    "body": "So that webmd link seems to conflate any amount of risk related to cigarattes, regardless of whether the risk is different between heavy and light smokers. This isn't true for most people, most people would happily take a lower risk for smoking fewer cigarettes and the contention that it is just as bad to be a light smoker compared to a heavy smoker might dissuade people from cutting down.\n\nWith that said let's turn to the literature:\n[this recent review](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2865193/) Looks at the risk of various smoking-related diseases in light smokers*. Two main effects stand out: cardiovascular disease and lung cancer.\n\n\nWith lung cancer being a light smoker does put you at greater risk than a non-smoker (3-5 times greater risk), but that increase in risk pales in comparison to being a heavy smoker (13-23 times greater risk).\n\n\nWith cardiovascular disease we see that light smoking gives you 70% of the increase in risk that heavy smoking does, so in this case it seems that even low consumption of cigarettes results in a similar risk to high consumption (which is what the webmd link is implying).\n\nOne thing not considered in any of this data is the risk of becoming a heavy smoker that comes with light smoking.\n\nTL/DR: With cardiovascular disease it seems that it even social smoking can increase your risk by a similar amount to heavy smoking. With lung disease however, there is very much a dose-dependent effect, less smoking results in a significantly lower risk for lung cancer. \n\n\n*the paper notes that the definition of \"Light smoker\" ranges from anywhere to 5-20 cigarettes a day, so it is difficult to determine whether the effects seen here are the same for this rather large range in consumption.\n",

Perhaps it would be fair to say that Confucianism furthered already existing tendencies?\n\nIt could be, and I'm outside any sort of expertise that I have, so do not take this as authoritative, but it could be that the Japanese already had this sort of customary practice, but Confucianism gave it a more structured format.\n\nFull disclosure, I believe that Confucius was the single greatest moral philosopher ever to live. He lived 100-200 years before Plato, and 2-300 years before Aristotle, yet the combined summation of their virtue ethics amounts to a really impractical version of Confucianism. So I will probably tend to over-emphasize the influence he had. But I really do think that the Japanese used a Confucian template to slowly restructure their social order, and I would argue that they knowingly did so.\n\nI should make clear that Japan modified Confucianism significantly to fit their political structure and culture. However, as far as I am aware it is agreed upon fact that Confucianism also significantly modified Japanese political structures and culture.\n\nAll that verbiage to say, that's a good point and I don't have a definite answer.",
