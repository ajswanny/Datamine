    "body": "I switched over to vaping from smoking, and I never understood how other people didn't get the idea that you do that shit away from public. We been smoking outside, in our cars, etc for years. Just because you're vaping doesn't mean you can do it wherever. Just follow the same etiquette you ha e been and don't be a dick. Can you smoke a cigarette in the theatre? No. So why do you think you can vape there?\n\nEdit since I have a lot of replies for mobile:\nThe main issue others have isn't if the vapor is poisonous or toxic, or 100% safe. It's an issue of being polite and respectful to other people. If people are all sharing a common, indoor public space together they don't want your giant rips flowing over them. Step away from people, do your thing, come back to people. If you insist on vaping in crowded public places you are just being rude.",

I absolutely hate cigarette smoke, so when some of my friends started using e-cigs I was super happy that they went from smelling like a factory's butthole to something almost pleasant (candy/fruit). I can be around them again. Naturally, health effects should be considered, but a lot of the backlash against e-cigs reeks of puritan bullshit.    \n\nEdit: noooo, why would you gild me?? I'm just another jerk on reddit \ud83d\ude27     \n\nEdit 2 because I can't reply to everyone: manners are one thing, and I'm sure there are a lot of mannerless vapers out there pissing you off, but what I'm talking about is the push to regulate e-cigs as tho they were the same as tobacco products. I first noticed the trend a few years ago when a series of NYTimes pieces came out decrying the dangers of e-cigs, but none of it was convincing to me. It was all \"We don't know the dangers yet\" and \"Won't somebody please think of the children (who will vape their way to worse drugs)?\" nonsense. So as a non-smoker whose life became better thanks to vaping, I've been exasperated by the pushback against it. I'd much rather people be vaping than smoking in public. Of course, if they're being dicks about it, you can let them know your displeasure, but don't codify it into such strict laws.",

But I think to stay on the safe side it would be naive to assume that just because it's a better alternative means it's healthy or doesn't have long term implications. I also don't blow smoke in people's faces or want it to be legal for people to vape indoors because I understand the concern from people who just don't want to be smelling/breathing it or have their kids around it. It would be a dick thing to do if we were to demand that others just deal with it. Some vapes produce a lot more vapor than others (which is different from smoke but that's whatever) so I understand that people aren't comfortable being indoors with clouds of it around them. I don't know if it's a public health concern but I can certainly empathize with it being a nuisance.",

Following the review PHE has published a paper on the implications of the evidence for policy and practice.**\n\n>**The comprehensive review of the evidence finds that almost all of the 2.6 million adults using e-cigarettes in Great Britain are current or ex-smokers, most of whom are using the devices to help them quit smoking or to prevent them going back to cigarettes. It also provides reassurance that very few adults and young people who have never smoked are becoming regular e-cigarette users (less than 1% in each group).**\n\n>**However, the review raises concerns that increasing numbers of people think e-cigarettes are equally or more harmful than smoking (22.1% in 2015, up from 8.1% in 2013: ASH Smokefree GB survey) or don\u2019t know (22.7% in 2015, ASH Smokefree GB survey).**\n\n",

I think everyone should do the same. It\u2019s not cool in my eyes. I\u2019m being a negative Nancy. But you still have to buy juice, at least $20 worth a week from what I\u2019ve heard. It\u2019s still not a smart decision even with zero health risks. To each their own though.\n\nEdit - I\u2019m a mechanic and it instantly became a smoke cloud in the shop due to vapes.

I saw a future where cigarette smokers could \"smoke\" indoors and it didn't bother anyone. Truly a win-win.   Then the smoke came.  And the flavored e-cigs that smelled like apples or cherries or pina colada.

Is it better than smoking?  Sure, but it doesn't mean I really want to smell the sickly sweet smell of artificial apples all day while I'm in the office. It doesn't mean I want to be distracted by your smoke cloud every thirty seconds, harmless as it may be.  \n\nUnfortunately, because vapers didn't reign this shit in we're now getting people saying \"no, you can't vape indoors anymore.\"  However,  I'll bet if you had one of the vapes like my buddy has that doesn't smoke and doesn't smell, no one is going to care.

They were fairly new when he bought his and his original idea was to just supplement his cigarettes because he was spending at least $50 a week.  Then the news was saying the prices would be going up.  He figured he could trade off and go back and forth.\n\nThen him and my mom discovered that it was $250 for the entire e-cigarette package.  My mother then informed him that it was one of the other.  He chose the e-cig.  4 months in he was still smoking it but it was nicotine free.  8 months later he had stopped using it completely and wasn't smoking.\n\nHe stopped coughing uncontrollably in the morning.  He said he could taste food again.  Everything tasted 20 times better.  He wasn't out of breathe just tying his shoes.  And it wasn't a problem being around the grandkids.\n\nGive it a try. People might call you a douche but you know what?  Fuck them.  When all of the benefits of not smoking come rolling back, feel free to be as douchey as you please.",

I had a shitty year and stuff and I thought fuck it, I need to make a change (no memes please)\n\nI currently bounce between 18mg and 12mg depending on flavour. I always smoked menthols and I\u2019ve carried over but if it\u2019s like double menthol or something I go for the weaker 12mg. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s different in the states or not. \n\nLike I said, I use one of the pen models [aspire K2](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Aspire-Quick-Start-Kit-Black/dp/B01MSDZKBO) but there are many other similar models. \n\nI also use a [smoke free app](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/smoke-free-stop-smoking-now/id577767592?mt=8https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/smoke-free-stop-smoking-now/id577767592?mt=8) to keep me on track. \n\nIf she were to do this though, you\u2019ll need to warn her that vapes can dehydrate you quite badly if you over do it. The first week I was puffing away like nobodies business and i got bad headaches, sore throat and light headed. \n\nDepending on the model and how often it is used, the coil will need to be replaced about every 7 days. \n\nIt\u2019s done wonders for me, only time I still might want a cigarette is when I see someone light one up on tv (doesn\u2019t bother me in real life) and that\u2019s only because the first puff was always the best. The vape quenches that immediately though. \nI\u2019ve also in the last month thought I\u2019d forgotten to pay some bills as I still had \u00a380 left in my wallet. Turns out smoking is damn expensive. \n\nAll the best to you and your girlfriend and I wish her luck. Sorry if it\u2019s a longer answer than you wanted :)\n\nNinja edit- one of the most important factors to remember is that she needs to *want* to quit. ",
