I can add more storage, I have 4 batteries so I never have to worry about charging it, and its gorgeous display still does great.   Only reason why I am starting to think I may make a change now is because I have some apps (like TeamSnap) that no longer run on my older OS.\n\nBums me out too, because the Note 2 seems [to me] to be the swansong of Samsung's line.  Opening the phone and being able to replace batteries and storage is such a dream.  I will never understand why that was marginally done away with in later versions.\n\nThe Note 8 is most likely my next move, but I am still bitter about not being able to buy reserve batteries, however at least the storage space is expandable.  256GB MicroSD ftw.

(More likely) cell reps work in *super* cutthroat environments where their performance is measured, at high level, by the average amount of account features (data plans, messaging plans, etc.) and accessories they sell per new account and upgrade they do. While again, it's a shitty attitude to have, someone coming in with a basic phone and no features is going to kill their metrics and potentially get them in trouble or even cost them their job (if it happens enough in a given month). \n\nTo that second point, when you're dealing with 30-40 customers a day you can't help but view them like just another upgrade or activation to a degree... so when someone comes in with a \"dead upgrade\" that isn't going to make them money and may even get them in trouble, they're probably not going to engage as much. It's shitty, but that's human nature. \n\nEdit: Although a good manager would say you represent an awesome chance to get some great numbers, since you'd be a straight upgrade to high-revenue features and a phone with a ton of accessories.

They have one of the top rated cell cameras out there.  The downside is that the only way you're getting a discount on these phones is to get a Verizon plan, otherwise you're going to be paying full price.\n\n\nSamsung is good, has water resistance and has one of the best cameras on the market, but you will be stuck with some bloatware that most people have no use for.  Why do you have 2 different apps for chat, photos, movies, etc?  Because Samsung wants you to use their shit, not Google's.  They're also a bit slow with security updates and seem to be pushing to create/use their own OS instead of android.\n\n\nLG/Motorola/HTC are all okay.  They haven't been blowing anybody away with their phones, but most reviews I've seen calls them perfectly adequate.  The MotoZ seems to have some fans because you can attach an extra battery to it; I've never seen anybody use their projector/speaker/camera things though, so I can't speak to how useful it is.\n\n\nThe bottom line for phones is that if you don't need the latest and greatest, and you don't play a bunch of games or take a million photos, you really don't need to buy one of the big flagship phones that you see all the ads for.  If you just text, call, browse and take the occasional photo you're going to be fine buying a 2-3 year old phone and saving $400+ ",

You can also download Battery Life Doctor and it will tell you what your battery capacity is compared to the original.\n\nYou can get your battery replaced at Apple or at a 3rd party place like Batteries + Bulbs (I think price is $60-80).

It was originally reported as XP being the problem because XP is usually the problem and the NHS is infamously unable to upgrade away from XP for many of their machines.\n\nIt's unpatched machines in general, not only old OSs. There have been a number of critical patches for Windows 10 machines in recent months that you really, really need to apply.\n\nSomehow getting people to trust and apply updates as soon as possible needs to be top priority now. Updates that break things or frustrate people by interrupting them is harmful if it means they just flat out stop updating. That's how you get vulnerabilities which have had patches available for months knocking out entire companies and healthcare systems. People (including sysadmins) stop trusting and applying patches and then systems die.\n\nFor Apple, shit like this article needs to be cut out. For Microsoft that means... I don't even know. More QA? Somehow streamlining the patch process? Definitely making an effort when it comes to IT professionals, highlighting training and tools for testing patches on their infrastructure.",
