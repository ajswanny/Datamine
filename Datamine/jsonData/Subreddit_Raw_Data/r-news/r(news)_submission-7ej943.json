Showing what they can do for our country. I think we lost that vision this election cycle. \n\nWhere I live, we\u2019ve always voted Democrat. My whole district, for literally decades. This year Hillary lost by 16 points. But we still elected Democrats across the state and federal level, in every other race.

Which, is a dubious justification, considering that pretty much all utilities and services that are regional monopolies are pretty heavily regulated. Like, we don't charge you more for electricity that charges your phone then we would for electricity that turns on a light of a certain brand. \n\nSomething I've been thinking about though, is what's to stop the Federal Trade Commission from coming in and destroying these ISPs after the FCC deregulates the internet? Unfairness and deception towards consumers represent two distinct areas of FTC enforcement and authority. The FTC also has authority over unfair methods of competition between businesses. \n\nOr even State laws? The FCC doesn't preempt State consumer protection laws, so they can't do anything about stopping States from making such laws. ",

They could tell us how we provide services and how we interact with customers and how we price these things. That doesn't make sense.\n\n\nReality\n>Verizon did not fully support net neutrality rules. Verizon filed a lawsuit against the FCC challenging its authority to impose net neutrality under Title I, which is why the agency moved to Title II.\n\nHere's the big money maker they're trying to force down everyones throat.\n\n>So what the FCC is doing, and this FCC agrees with that it says, \"We're going to take away the public utility regulation, but we're going to find a way to put those net neutrality rules on a different legal footing so they're still enforcible.\n\nThat \"different legal footing\" exactly means changing ISPs from Title 2 to Title 1 and they're all going to pinky swear to not do anything bad.",

Everything was handed to them. And they took it all: sex, drugs, and rock and roll, and they stayed loaded for 20 years and had a free ride. But now they're staring down the barrel of middle-age burnout, and they don't like it. So they've turned self-righteous. They want to make things harder on younger people. They tell 'em, abstain from sex, say no to drugs; as for the rock and roll, they sold that for television commercials a long time ago...so they could buy pasta machines and stairmasters and\u00a0soybean futures! They're cold, bloodless people. It's in their slogans, it's in their rhetoric: \"No pain, no gain.\" \"Just do it.\" \"Life is short, play hard.\" \"Shit happens, Deal with it.\" \"Get a life.\" These people went from 'do your own thing' to 'just say No'. They went from 'love is all you need' to 'whoever winds up with the most toys wins'. And they went from cocaine to Rogaine. And you know something, they're still counting grams, only now it's fat grams. And the worst of it is, the rest of us have to watch these commercials on TV for Levi's loose-fitting jeans and fat-ass Docker pants, because these degenerate yuppie Boomer cocksuckers couldn't keep their hands off the croissants and the Haagen-Dazs, and their big fat asses have spread all over and they have to wear fat-ass Docker pants.
