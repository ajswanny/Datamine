I tried getting *multiple counsellors* from high school over the years to find help for me, (one in particular to call cps, but, I was almost 18 (when I was 16-17) and she essentially said it would prove futile even if she called) but all of them really didn't seem to care. One of them felt like my suicidality was less important than kids trying to get scholarships, because she told me she'd check up on me again after the first time we met, but she never did. I saw kids with money take up more of her time in her office than I ever did. But, honestly in the ends, I didn't need any of their help. I just needed to see that sometimes you have to work through this alone, and then share your store later when you're out of the woods and still breathing. People like this do not deserve children.

They will lambast people like H3H3, Philip Defranco, Pewdiepie and others for their content to which by no means targets people to offend and pulls ads on their videos, but at the same time was supporting Daddy of 5 until news and videos were seen and broken down to see the abuse while they were getting paid for each punch and kick the children were doing to each other and the parents to them for the views.  Lets not forget some of these people who dress in the morph suits and Disney characters who do some disgusting things that kids think that they are ok but are detrimental to a kid when they actually see what they are doing. Maybe if we give YouTube a Pepsi maybe they can see through the BS and support their creators that made them big and not these people who do harmful things to people and others for views.\n\nEdit: Lambast not land blast. why i ever thought that i have no idea.",

I watched several of the videos on the archive and many YouTube videos where others analyze or talk about what's going on.\n\nAs a loving father, I have to say that this has really affected me today. I have two young boys, my oldest is five and is special needs. I love both of my boys more than anything in the world. I just can't imagine ever treating one of my sons the way this man treats his boy, Cody. \n\nWhile watching these videos, I see glimpses of my own son in Cody. He's sweet, intelligent, and emotionally advanced for his age, like my son is. Maybe he does have behavioral issues, but that is nowhere near a worthy excuse to put any child through the kind of abuse this poor, sweet boy has been through. Plus, Cody is a special-needs child! His poor brain is already having a hard enough time processing the world, and now this father is making things way worse by inflicting this abuse onto the poor kid. Cody knows he is being treated unfairly, but he doesn't know what to do about it, and in fact there's not much he can do. And that's what makes this so hard for me. I'm tearing up now just writing this. All those times he is left to himself crying and shouting that his family doesn't love him or like him. I just want to hug him and let him know he is loved, and I'm sorry he's been treated this way.\n\nI also feel for little Emma. I hope her and Cody will get the help and love they need now that they are back with their biological mom. Maybe that's not a perfect situation either, but nothing ever is perfect. And hopefully if there's any silver lining to this situation being so public, it's that the mom may now get the resources she needs to help the kids cope with the abuse and give them a good upbringing.\n\nI feel for the other kids too. They are just kids, even the teenager. Kids can be cruel, but it's up to responsible, loving parents to be the moderator and the filter that processes things when others are mean to them, not to contribute to the meanness or create it to begin with.\n\nThese people, Mike and Heather, are truly despicable. The emotional abuse they have caused those poor kids is heartbreaking, especially Cody. I will hug my boys extra tight tonight.",

He knows when he is being abused and he can't numb the pain and he can't accept that it is the same people who are supposed to be his big protective loving humans. The parents act like middle school bullies and manipulative idiots. They definitely should be prohibited of having custody of any child ever in their life. In fact the father deserves to go to jail for the way he just bumped Cody into the fucking bookshelf and made him bleed out of his nose(who knows if the injury was even worse than it seemed). And they want to say it was just acting/just a prank? Oh shut the hell up that is just about the weakest most elementary justification ever. All of those things screamed child abuse and obviously someone who abuses a child and thinks/pretends it is normal is someone who is all around 100% unfit to be a parent, ever. Call me extremely judgmental/harsh I don't give a damn, I draw the line when it comes to children being abused. The saddest part is that those kids don't even realize it to it's full extent how bad and stressful their daily living situation actually is. They are children with developing minds and bodies growing and changing constantly. As the stronger and more experienced adults we should protect and help them flourish not break them. Seeing it from a third person point of view just makes it crystal clear and being able to process it exactly for what it is(no ifs and buts about it) just makes it feel worse. ",

They don't know enough to say no! \n\nThese kids are going to grow up, go out in the world and have a rough time finding a job or friends, because one google search will bring up their life on youtube for all to see. But this isn't seen as an issue. I don't know if it necessarily is \"child abuse\", but it's a problem I think that'll be an issue in the future for a lot of youtube kids.\n\nI'm glad that these kids got out, though.",

Being forced to display one emotion while feeling the full force of another can cause emotional detachment and severe emotional maturity issues because you're being trained rather than allowed to react.\n\nEdit: I just wanna make super clear what I'm talking about. In one video (I think the second broken Xbox one, but there were so many), Cody is crying in bed after being tormented and AbusiveDad uncovers him and tells him \"smile for me. You won't get any present if you don't smile and say you love me. C'mon, Cody. **Smile.**\" Cody looks at the camera, drops his sad face and smiles with empty eyes (and then says heartless words and does the outro). Doing this is incredibly damaging as it tells Cody that his real emotions are not to be shown and it will cause all kinds of internalization and emotional connection issues. It can cause emotional detachment and it's even worse when it comes from a non-parent (like a step-parent or adoptive parent).\n\nI bet, when he's alone and sleeping and feels sort of safe, he cocoons himself with blankets and makes them super tight and (almost) binding.

A crying boy in exasperation asking, \"You did all this for a prank?\" and begging for a moment of privacy so that he can \"calm down.\"\n\n2.  Numerous instances of \"I hate you,\" delivered with the most sincerity I've ever seen delivered towards a parent, even after the \"prank\" has been revealed.\n\n3. The boy trying to avoid being pranked and declining to participate only to be forced into it.\n\n4. The redhead boy going on a tragic monologue about how he will be \"better than you\" (the dad holding the camera in his face), \"better than his brothers, better than the dogs.\" The father, naturally, laughs in his face. \"The dogs? LOLWUT??!\"\n\n5. The girl having what can only be described as a type of emotional breakdown as she desperately tries to explain she was drawing a picture that was ruined by a water gun ambush.\n\nThey know they are trapped in one of the circles of Hell and are pleading for any way to escape.  At times, it almost seems like they go along with it either to please their captors or to insulate themselves from the reality of what's going on.  Even the abused kids say, \"It was just a prank\" at times, probably as a coping mechanism.",

We don't really know.\n\nThe dad is a huge shitbag who shouldn't have custody of any kids, but unfortunately we don't know much about the mom either.

It's the reporting to proper authorities that gets results. \n\nEdit: Thanks, guys for remembering her name. She's /u/deracinated here and Grumpkin on YouTube.\n\n[This](https://youtu.be/lbOBw119ZQ0) is the video she posted on /r/videos. it was taken down and she later reposted it begging people not to witch hunt, but that post didn't get nearly as much attention. She definitely deserves recognition for calling attention to it and reporting to the proper authorities.\n\nThat's not to say, of course, that /u/PhillyDeFranco doesn't deserve credit too. He used his celebrity for something good and if you ask me, that's good. Thanks, Philly D.   \n\n\\*Also, yes. You guys are right.

Public outrage allows authorities to prioritize cases.\n\nIf you get a chicken head in your nuggets and only tell the manager you get a free meal, but if you go on a rant on Twitter and it goes viral it might actually change store policies so chicken heads are less likely to show up as nuggets.

I'm almost 25 now and whenever my dad antagonizes her (they're divorced but she will take him back any moment. It's quite sad actually. And he's a cheater and liar.

My roommates all have very good relationships with their parents and they are all still together. Affection from my parents makes me uncomfortable. I'm jealous of my friends and I think all the abuse I had over the years hasn't enabled me to know what a real relationship is. \n\nMy parents fucked me up",

Chances are these children feel victimized and helpless. They've probably been made to believe that if they seek help, they'll be reprimanded. The parents would almost certainly not have allowed a plea for help to be posted to YouTube anyway. It's probable that even during the investigation, they were being coerced into telling CPS that everything is alright. I'm glad their investigation was (somewhat) successful.\n\nAt any rate, I hope bio-mom turns out to be a much better parent. The bar wasn't set very high to begin with.",

A lot of our fosters were apprehended at birth - usually due to issues with drug addiction or a previous record of neglect. \n\nThe kids got loving, secure parenting for their first one-or-two years with us. Their parents either got clean and proved they were capable of taking care of their children or, more often, the kids were adopted. As foster parents/sibs, we were able to meet potential adoptive parents and give our two cents. I still get Christmas cards with school pictures of all my little foster siblings, and two of the adoptive families are now close family friends.

I hope you like the beach and the mountains, because that's where me and your new sister hang out after college. \n\nIt's time to start seeing your mother objectively as another adult woman. It's hard, I know. You need to cut her out of your life the next time she flings rudeness toward you. If she calls ranting? Think in terms of objective reality: there is no legally binding reason for you to ever have to deal with that. You are one person and she is another, approaching to attack and degrade you. To anyone watching, she is an assailant, not a motherly figure. You don't have to deal with that from her any more than you would a strange woman her age calling you ranting. If you wouldn't tolerate a random adult approaching you and calling you all those horrible things, you don't have to tolerate it from her. To anyone besides you, that's all she is: a grownass woman abusing another grownass woman. \"I don't live in your home anymore. In your home people were allowed to abuse those smaller than themselves. You will treat me with respect or you will be uninvited permanently.\" Then drop it. Don't answer contact. It'll be hard for a short while, you'll feel guilty, and then it will just...feel so much better. It takes a long while to get comfortable with people loving you as family or friends, but you deserve it. There is no realistic reason that you cannot develop loving bonds with people who value you just for being you. Other people don't see and hear or believe any negative thing your parents have said about you. They see an adult woman with anything else you choose to be. \n\nYou did not volunteer your life to be treated poorly. You are not your mother, she does not own you, and you will be a healthier, more respectful, more loving and independent adult than her. If your friends have great families, adopt them. I have a couple of \"adoptive\" families, but it took some time to feel like they wanted me around.\n\nI got \"lucky\" in that my mom died and I could suddenly see all of her behaviours for what they were. I decided then to speak to abusive people as if they were a large child throwing a tantrum. You don't hit me, you don't disrespect my body, my intelligence, my space, my privacy, my safety.  Go try that on another random adult. (They never do, they are cowards.) You do not have to be involved in your parents' cycle of abuse.",

You had to travel out of town to work literally anywhere aside from the corner shop. Just about everyone had children right out of high school or before they graduated. Drug and alcohol addiction was extremely normal. If you smoked and drank while pregnant, no one thought anything of it. If you left your eight year old home to take care of her toddler siblings, that was totally acceptable. \n\n\n\n\n\nI came from a very dysfunctional, though otherwise out-of-place home. I saw a social worker regularly and one thing she told me stuck with me forever; she said that the majority of the cases she's had with young girls involved incestuous rape. It was a huge open secret. I have three cousins that have been sexually assaulted by a family member (afaik), one of them is male and was molested by his mother. Four of my cousins had at least one of their children taken away from them due to neglect and drugs in the home; one accidentally smothered his newborn to death while he nodded off on heroin. There really is more abuse going on in rural towns than most people are aware of. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit: if any of you are unlucky enough to know of Blue Rapids or Waterville, KS, you know what I'm talking about and you probably know who my cousins are. \n\n\n",

Its sick. \n\nOf particular note is how they target the youngest, Cody. There was at least one other kid that was included, but the focus was almost entirely on Cody. In a (now removed) video, the dad lectures Cody for scratching his arm up while at school, which I can relate to. My dad enjoyed getting me worked up and then punishing me for reacting. There was literally no way I could respond to or defend myself from his harassment that wouldn't result in me being punished so I took that pent up frustration/anger and scratched my arm until I bled. The difference is my dad wasn't enough of a jackass to film the abuse, post it online to make money, and defend it as \"a prank, bruh\".",

It was eerily similar to my own childhood with my dad always playing \"jokes\" on me and getting my siblings to gang up on me. It's a classic narcissist tactic: triangulation. I was the scapegoat so everything I did was bad and laughable. My sister was the golden child so everything she did was praised and untouchable. My brothers were just there as reinforcements for my dad's reign of terror / \"jokes.\" It literally took me more than a decade of counseling to begin to understand just how fucked up triangulation is. It also means that at nearly 40, I don't speak to my parents or sister at all. My brothers both acknowledged how fucked up it was and they've been pretty helpful in affirming what I now understand was abuse. My sister, ever the golden child, still believes I'm a fuckup and has treated me with contempt my entire life even though I've done absolutely nothing wrong and spent 30+ years trying to prove that I wasn't a loser to her. I finally gave up and I've been VERY happily living my own life with my own sweet, happy family. \n\nFor anybody who watched these videos and didn't thing they were that big of a deal, trust me, this shit fucks people up for their entire lives. \n\nI really hope the rest of those kids are removed from that home. Nobody deserves to be treated like that. \n\nEdit: Oooh gold! Thanks anonymous person! That's really sweet. Maybe someday I'll figure out how to give other people gold and pay it forward. ",

This seems like a bit of a mix up between modern neuroscience and old Freudian speculation. \n\nWhat does, however, happen is that higher and very frequent levels of stress can cause the degeneration of hippocampal neurons over time. This is because the hippocampus is involved in negative feedback regulation of the HPA axis, which is the governing system of your stress response. When the HPA axis becomes overactive, the hippocampus is exposed to excessive levels of corticosteroids, which causes some of its neurons to die. This in itself also leads to a poorer negative feedback control of the HPA axis (since there are fewer available receptors as a result of loss of neurons), which leads to hyper reactivity of the HPA axis. In turn, this again results in the exposure to even higher levels of corticosteroids, and for longer periods of time, than before. \n\n[This seems like a good read](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0097689) in case you or anyone else is interested ",
