Just as I'm about to pay, a large black SUV with blacked out windows pulled up next to me and the driver side window slid down.  Driver called me over and had a ticket in hand.  He said, go park in spot #12, I already paid for that one and it has 2 more hours to go.  I thanked him and offered to pay him back, but he wouldn't accept anything.  The window rolled up and he drove away.  As a poor college kid at the time, I moved my car to the pre-paid spot and chalked it up as a win. \n\nThe dude in the car was Terry Crews.  He did me a small favor just because it was the cool thing to do.\n\nEven more respect for him after today.  ",

    "body": "I'm a mid-level actor in Los Angeles.  Sexual harassment is but one of several forms of \"weeding out\" actors from opportunities.  It's done also by favoring family ties and discriminating against actors based upon what agency represents them for television and film (so-called \"theatrical\" representation).  Many casting directors disregard submissions from mid to low-level talent agencies for Guest Star parts on television, for example.  They claim the reason is to save time, but the more likely reason is that when they give business to the higher level talent agencies, they get more work referred to them by the directors and producers also represented by those agencies.  But sexual harassment gets the most news.  The fact is that if an actor is iced out of the industry and his or her career is suppressed, the bottom line is the same: the actor has great difficulty progressing to better and more lucrative roles.  Many actors have experienced sexual harassment and probably it occurs more at the lower echelons of the professional actor community.  This is because once an actor has reached a certain high level and is in demand, that demand tends to be widespread and saying \"no\" to any given director, producer or casting director tends to have lesser consequences.  20 years ago or so I had worked for a particular film company on two films and the notoriously gay casting director asked me to go to dinner and a movie with him.  I knew this person on a superficial basis and only in the context of him being a casting director.  After I thanked him for the compliment but said no thank you, I was never brought into that office again for any other film or acting project.  Was this sexual harassment?  Who knows for sure, but probably.  I never reported it as such since it was so nebulous, but that's how it often works.  You're asked on what amounts to a date.  If you go along, then things might work out for you down the line for an acting role.  If you don't go along, then, if it's sexual discrimination, you are never again brought in for any appropriate role.  This process has happened this way in Hollywood literally for decades.  How to stop this in the future?  Heavy punitive damages award if it is proven in a court of law, and enactment of laws that prohibit settlements of these kinds of dispute from being confidential.  You cannot put the onus all on the actor to say \"no\" since it is like many other employment situations--the duress is too great, considering the stakes, for an actor to be expected to say no when so much is on the line.  I did, but not every actor has the same will power and principles.  One final point: there are many actors, both male and female, who use sex to their advantage and they also can be considered predators.  They give sexual advances in exchange for promises and they are on the offering side.  So, this sexual exchange system does operate in reverse as well in Hollywood.",

One in three women experiences sexual harassment at work. I cannot tell you how many of those experience groping but I will tell you that in 15 years in the service industry I have had 17 men touch me inappropriately at work. Everywhere from boob grabs to grabbing me by the hips and dry humping me. It is scary when it comes from someone with power, but much more terrifying when those in power defend the perpetrators and/or threaten your livelihood for mentioning the \"transgression\".\n\nThis is an issue that has been around for both men AND women since the beginning of civilization. Maybe we can be the generation to fix it if we talk about it enough. Maybe not. Who knows.",

It took for all this stuff with Harvey to come out for Terry to find the strength to talk about it publicly. Imagine how an average person would feel in a similar position without millions in the bank and being built like a tank. As a victim of abuse myself I can say from personal experience how it is the mental aspect that is what holds you a prisoner.

No fans to appeal to, no big names to stand with them, no money to fall back on if the jobs dry up, etc. And by the time some of these men and women get older, they have been through it. They may not even think of working against the system until something like this happens where it finally clicks that they can do shit.

I\u2019m a woman, and I have been assaulted more than once.  I\u2019m not trying to diminish my own pain. I believe that it is often much harder for men to report sexual assault because there are additional layers of emasculation and the social perception is very different. Women tend to get a lot more support when they come out as victims whereas male victims are more likely to be met with suspicion and ridicule. Though obviously in celebrity cases the victim shaming is pretty rampant against both genders. ",
