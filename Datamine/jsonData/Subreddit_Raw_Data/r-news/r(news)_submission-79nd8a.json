I just feel the need to say: if the comments here blow up, or the talking heads on TV start yammering, please be very skeptical of what gets said. Anyone who makes a strong declarative statement about whether he's guilty or not, or what else Mueller might have planned... nobody could know that yet. At this early stage, the stronger a commentator's conclusions, the less likely they are to be credible. If you're watching Fox or reading Huffpo and someone starts a sentence with \"This is clearly-\" - then that is the time to find a better news source. Or, even better: go outside and do something else, while we wait.\n\nEDIT: Thank you for the gold! I will make sure to report it on my taxes :)\n",

Manager. \n\nHe deserves a fair trial, but from my understanding Mueller and people like him do not indite people on charges unless they have a slam dunk case. \n\nEdit: I can't spell indict. Also to add more info of how fucking crazy this is, these aren't even normal criminal charges. He is being accused, amongst other things, of conspiracy against the United States. This isn't just Trump's campaign manager being busted with some shady accounting (though it also is), this isn't just Trump's campaign manager being busted for some boring white-collar crimes (though it also is), this is his campaign manager being accused of hurting the United States while helping a foreign government. \n\nThink long and hard about this.

However, Mueller is aware of the narrative from many Republicans about his investigation. If he were to charge Manafort on something completely unrelated to the Trump campaign, it would just fuel the fire for Trump to shut it down. He would have reason to state that Mueller isn't focusing on the stated objective of the special council, and that he wasn't brought in to look at non-Russia related things. \n\nUnless Mueller wants the President to try and fire him through the DOJ, it's very unlikely these initial charges aren't directly linked to the Trump campaign.

    "body": "There is far too much trying to turn this around onto Podesta from the right or wild wish fulfillment from the left in the comments, its clear that 99% of the people comment on this haven't actually read the indictment. \n\nHere is the actual indictment, everyone should read it for themselves:\n\nhttps://www.justice.gov/file/1007271/download\n\nHere is the summary, but again don't take my word for it, research for yourself and make up your own mind.\n\n**Conspiracy against United States**\n\nAccording to the indictment, Manafort and Gates went to great lengths to conceal from the United States \"their work as agents of, and millions of dollars in payments from, Ukraine and its political parties and leaders.\"\n\nThis one may sounds like its a charge for treason to the general public, but its actually fairly common in these types of indictments and simply means they willfully decided to take illegal action:\n\n>While it's a common term circulated in the legal profession, it's less well known to the general public.The description may sound a bit alarming, but the count is fairly common in federal cases, legal experts say.\n\n>\" This is not novel by any stretch,\" says Bill Mateja, who worked in Department of Justice as a prosecutor during the George W. Bush administration and now works in white collar defense law at the law firm Polsinelli. \"I will tell you almost every notable big federal case has got a conspiracy count.\"\n\n>The indictment explains that Manafort and Gates, over the past 11 years \"knowingly and intentionally conspired to defraud the United States by impeding, impairing, obstructing and defeating the lawful governmental functions of a government agency, namely the Department of Justice and the Department of the Treasury.\"\n\n>In short, says Mateja, this means that Manafort and Gates simply agreed to take illegal action. In this case, the illegal action Manafort and Gates are alleged to have taken, according to the indictment, includes failing to report their foreign bank account reports, failing to register as foreign agents and providing false statements about their lobbying work with Ukrainian government over the course of 11 years.\n\nhttp://time.com/5002415/paul-manafort-was-just-indicted-for-conspiracy-against-the-united-states-whats-that/\n\n**Conspiracy to launder money**\n\nThe indictment says that both men generated tens of millions of dollars as a result of their lobbying work for the Ukraine. They hid the payments, from 2006 through 2016, by laundering the money through scores of U.S. and foreign corporations, partnerships and banks, according to the charges.\n\nManafort laundered more than $18 million, which the indictment says he concealed from the federal government.\n\nFrom 2008 to 2014, Manafort wired $12 million to vendors for personal items, including $5.4 million on home improvements in the Hamptons, $934,350 to an antique rug store in Virginia, $520,440 to a clothing store in Beverley Hills and $655,500 for landscaping in New York, according to the indictment.\n\nHe also spent millions more on homes: $1.5 million on Soho condo; $3 million on a Brooklyn brownstone and $1.9 million on a Virginia house.\n\nThe indictment says that Manafort used his offshore accounts to directly wire payments for his personal expenses, which allowed him to avoid paying taxes on that income.\n\n**Failing to file FBARs (Report of Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts)**\n\nEach \"US person\" with an interest in, signature or other authority over, one or more bank, securities, or other financial accounts in any foreign country must file an FBAR if the aggregate value of such accounts at any point in a calendar year exceeds $10,000. A \"US person\" generally means a citizen or resident of the United States, or a person in and doing business in the United States \u2013 it is not limited to individual taxpayers and includes partnerships and corporations. In other words, if the total of your interests in all of the foreign accounts in which you have an interest (even if it's authoritative rather than financial) reaches $10,000 or more at any point in the calendar year, you need to file an FBAR. Failure to comply can make you a criminal. And the feds take this pretty seriously since the Report of Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts requirements (31 CFR 103.24), or the FBAR rules, are part of the Banking Secrecy Act.\n\n**Failure to register as an agent of a foreign principal.** \n\nAs noted earlier, if you're acting as an agent of a foreign principal, you're required to disclose that to the government. Specifically, under FARA, persons acting as agents of foreign principals in a political or quasi-political capacity must disclose their relationship, as well as activities, receipts and disbursements in support of those activities. The feds allege that Manafort and Gates willfully failed to file the proper documentation.\n\n**False Statements**\n\nThe indictment alleges that in 2016 and 2017, when the details about their actions at home and abroad were made known, Manafort and Gates \"knowingly and willfully caused to be made a false statement of a material fact, and omitted a material fact necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in a document filed with and furnished to the Attorney General under the provisions of FARA.\n\nThe charges boil down to this: Manafort and Gates were paid to promote Ukrainian interests to the U.S. government. That's not a crime. However, they were required to report that they were doing it - and further that they were paid to it - and according to the feds, they didn't report it. That is a crime. And when asked about their work by the Justice Department, they allegedly lied about it. That's also a crime. And to cover their tracks, they failed to show the U.S. government the money.\n\nI think the George Papadopolous situation is much more interesting and damaging to Trump, the documents were just released today:\n\nhttps://www.justice.gov/file/1007346/download\n\nAccording to court documents, Papadopolous was arrested this summer and accused of making contacts with foreign nationals tied to the Russian government - and then lying about it.",

So at this stage Trump is basically stealing money from a children's cancer hospital.\n\nOf course Eric could have resigned from the charity's board in protest and he didn't.
