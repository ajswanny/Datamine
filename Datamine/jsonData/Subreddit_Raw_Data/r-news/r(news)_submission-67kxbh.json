    "body": "Okay, so i like a mob and pitchforks as much as the next guy, but, having fostered a large number of rabbits (somewhere around 40) for the house rabbit society over the years, i'm not sure the fault really lies with united (for the record, the last 4 rabbits i had all lived to > age 14, but this is not that common).  \n\nRabbits are exotic animals. Really. They really are prey animals, and not really meant to handle a lot.  They go into shock, gi stasis, etc very quickly (due to stress, etc).  Once that happens, they can actually die quite quickly without immediate treatment.  Heck they can die from being startled.  They require exotic vets to handle, and as they get older, for example, the likelihood they don't wake up from things like \"simple anesthesia to get teeth trimmed\" gets really high.\n\nEven the coolest of bunnies can get highly stressed very quickly and things can go very badly.  This doesn't even go into how many other afflictions and issues they have.\n\nYou are talking about animals where one of the most successful techniques to bond them into pairs is to mildly stress them out by putting them in the same carrier and taking a *car ride*.  They get freaked out enough they stop worrying about hating each other and start snuggling. But you can't even do *that* too long because it's *too stressful* for them.\n\nAll of this is another way of saying \"putting a rabbit in the cargo hold of an airplane is a very hit or miss thing\". Saying 'never had a problem\" is just silly.  Some do okay. A *lot* do not.  That's assuming everything goes right.\n\nHaving a vet check them out is generally a pre-req anyway, but it really doesn't tell you much. Rabbits can go from healthy to dead in hours or less due to stress.  I've never met a rabbit vet who didn't recommend against flying with them.\n\n(here's what the house rabbit society says about it:\nhttp://rabbit.org/to-fly-or-not-to-fly-2/.  Note \"could compromise their health - or worse\".)\n\nGoogling it will tell you that plenty of owners have had enough trouble being in the cabin, let alone putting them in the cargo hold. You'll also see  that among experts, what i said is a very consistent viewpoint.\n\nSo by and large, unless you can bring them in cabin, it's considered by most to be \"a bad idea\", and if you can bring them in the cabin, even then, usually \"a last resort\" (IE you couldn't find someone to take care of them while you were gone).\n\n",

But most of the time we are talking about an extra flight to a city that's far out of the way, or sometimes no routing at all if United is off the table.  \n\nETA My husband and I both are premium passengers with United.  I don't think infrequent flyers realize just how well we are catered to by airlines. We are very simply not at risk for shitty treatment. But the arrogance is so strong with United that they haven't so much as sent an email to valued customers about the recent shit show.

She brought it up to corporate and they basically said, oh well we tried to find you another flight in time...but we couldn't.
