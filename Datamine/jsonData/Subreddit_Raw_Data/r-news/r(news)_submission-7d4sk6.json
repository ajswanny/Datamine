That the people who commit those acts find themselves easy under the protection of money, influence or even social bias and protection. They know, certain things are not easy to proof, they know there are most likely no consequences and they know, that society is gonna put so much pressure on a victim unless it has instantly a video at hand that proofs \"that happened\". (Sometimes there is direct proof and people will still blame the victims, shame them and so on or act like it is \"not that bad\" in their opinion or try to find excuses for unacceptable actions those call for consequences.) \n\nSo why and how should most people those already feel weak, abused and alone face all that? Most people do not want that, so they stay silent and we keep on creating the perfect world for the ones who abuse or harass others.\n\nSociety matters. It matters that Terry is a strong black man, if he would have faught back without having direct proof, the bias would be \"black agressive man, probably drunk could not control his emotions\", the accused would still have more power. Could control the news. People would not talk about Terry and an indivieual anymore, but as the \"dude who thought violence is an answer\". If Terry would have been a woman, they would have said \"she over reacted\" or \"probably slept her way up\" and is a liar since she has no direct proof.\n\nIn the case of sexual harassment you can be physically strong, weak, beautiful, less beautiful, young, old. People will always find a reason and a bias to not believe you or shame you and try to find the problem within you, not within the guilty part. \n\nIf you have money and influence and don't have to face social consequences, what kind of ego do you think people will have? The biggest. \nLook at Trumps comments and actions when it comes to sexual harassment, people were thinking it is fine enough to vote that person as their president.\n\nI am glad that people in power now start to come forward. Even if it is a small step, but at least victims know they are not alone, even thou they have to stay silence themselves.",

Michael, one of the twins, stated the mother only drives an Escalade while their father drives a Rolls Royce (lol).  Michael also stated that Adams backyard is as big as a football field. Michael explained that it is so much bigger than Jamis backyard. Sarah wanted her soccer friends to go to her fathers home to see how cool it was. Both twins stated that they wanted gates around Jamis property because they live in a gated community with their father. They said they would feel much safer with a gate.

It's not that you're so calm and well-controlled that you pause and think things through in a situation that is shocking and traumatic, it's that you've been doing it so long it becomes instinctual. \n\nIt's very similar to how many of the things women do to keep themselves saf*er*, are done without a well defined thought process, you just do them. There's another post today about the female jogger who stabbed her attacker with half the comments questioning why she was carrying a weapon and inferring, or even outright stating that she's some kind of psycho for being armed with a small knife while out jogging. No, she's just a woman out exercising alone in the dark. Of course she's armed and not understanding how normal that is(not to mention expected of us)displays an awful lot of privilege.",

    "body": "I understand your question, having thought about it myself. I've come to this conclusion: Everyone's threshold of what's going to traumatize them is different. \n\nSexual assault is the ultimate invasion of personal privacy. It's someone effectively telling you, without necessarily even using words \"I just did this to you, and you were powerless to stop me.\" Powerless because the assaulter physically forced themselves on them, or powerless because someone else was exploiting a position of power over them and they felt they didn't have the power to refuse their advances (Think Winestein), or powerless because they were ambushed like Terry was and simply didn't have time to raise a defense. That's a mind-fuck (literally and figuratively) under the type of circumstances and experiences many victims are finally coming forward about and reporting. \n\nSay someone breaks into your house...would you still feel safe there? Let's assume you don't and you decide to move to a new place to feel safer. All is well, right? \n\nWell, if you get sexually assaulted, you can't just pick up and move to a new place, you're stuck with the skin you're in and that memory is stuck in your brain. That's why sexual assault is so serious and should be taken seriously; there's no undoing that feeling of a loss of privacy except with lots of time and healing, and everyone's going to be different in that regard based on their own individual resiliency. \n\nWhat you may be observing or postulating is a general lowering of the average person's resiliency these days due to the increased perception that, like some people might say, \"everyone's such a pussy these days\". Even if that were a measurable quantifiable thing, keep in mind that everyone has the right and expectation to privacy in their own body, and no one else gets to decide where that threshold is. \n\n\"But wait!\" you say \"That means anyone can claim they were assaulted, and because they get to decide it makes assault totally subjective, and that's bullshit!\" You're absolutely right, and that's why there's legal definitions of what is and isn't assault, and judges and juries get to decide on the grey areas. If it doesn't rise to sexual assault, it's probably sexual harassment. Both are serious, but it's a cultural thing what is and isn't tolerated. Right now the pendulum is swinging towards less toleration of everything, and as long as this newfound power for good isn't abused by unscrupulous false accusers, it's a welcome trend in the right direction.

One of my favorite memories is my dad telling me one weekend that we were going on a roadtrip. We piled in the car and drove SEVEN hours to Atlanta. There was a Dave and Busters in a suburb there called Marietta, and they had these pods made by Virtual Worlds Entertainment LLC - they\u2019re like an actual Battletech mech simulator. I didn\u2019t even know they existed, he was researching my hobby and found out about them. We played for like 8 hours.\n\n\nMan, so many memories of my dad being the best dad. I loved Redwall novels as a kid, and he thought Brian Jacques was a worthy hero, so we would road trip to a nearby city together every year to attend book signings and see Brian Jacques. It was just magic. I still have signed copies of almost all the Redwall novels on my bookshelf today.\n\nHe took me to all 50 states before I was 18. He wanted me to see the glaciers before humans melt them, so he took me cross-country by train to Montana and we hiked and camped in Glacier National Park together for a week. We went to the top of the World Trade Center together because I asked what the tallest building in America was, and spent Christmas Day at Niagara Falls because I asked him if waterfalls freeze in the winter (spoiler, Niagara Falls doesn\u2019t freeze.) He took me to the Grand Canyon and listened to my favorite Norah Jones and John Mayer cds the whole way there and back from Vegas in the rental car, and sang along with me. I\u2019m pushing 30 now and he\u2019s nearly 70, and he still travels 2000 miles to see me 3-4 times a year, just to hang out and adventure together. I have a thousand amazing stories about how my dad is my hero.\n\nI have the best dad that has ever fathered.",

Because it can ruin your life is why. Even if you secure a prosecution, which takes basically a written confession or unmistakeable physical evidence gathered immediately, you\u2019ll still have to testify to the grossest moments of your life in open court. Have people not believe you. Then the person could still plea down to nothing and get a slap on the wrist.\n\nIronically they/we *don\u2019t* want to be treated like victims, with kid gloves. Be defined by it. Want to just move on and go about our lives. But of course it is relevant. Pretty much everyone gets some degree of PTSD. Has certain ways they can\u2019t stand to be touched. Trust issues. Even if you\u2019re in a fine place mentally it can be hard to talk about it and explain, you can never be sure someone won\u2019t over-react or under-react.\n\nI think the best thing to say is, \u201cI\u2019m so sorry that happened to you. I hope you always feel like you can talk to me, tell me if something makes you uncomfortable. You\u2019re a really strong person for enduring that, and I really admire you.\u201d Don\u2019t tell them what to do, how they ought to feel. They\u2019ve been second-guessing and judging themselves plenty. Remind them of everything you like about them, why you like them. ",
