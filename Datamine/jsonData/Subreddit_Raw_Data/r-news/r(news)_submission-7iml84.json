All media that people consume are corporate-backed, both \"conservative\" and \"liberal\"....and they're dramatically increasing in power every year. \n\nAll corporations aren't identical, but they all have one purpose: to maximise profit and manufacture needs and wants. Every corporation also wants to be a monopoly, and with the increasing rate of mega-mergers we're only a couple of decades away from a few mega-conglomerates holding all the power in the world, and a mutual understanding to not compete too much with each other. \n\nWhen this happens, these institutions will be more powerful than any government(since they own most of the politicians in major governments) and also, they will be completely unaccountable to the public. They are authoritarian institutions, and must be dramatically curtailed if any hope for future innovation, creativity and democracy is to be saved. \n\nNow, the alternative to corporations cannot be the state control of production(which is what Libertarians are worried about) *a la* the Soviet Union - then the oligarchs just move from corporations to the state. The *real* issue is private, unaccountable, and large-scale control of resources by undemocratic institutions, whether it be oligarchs in corporations or oligarchs in states. I would recommend people look up [Libertarian Socialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libertarian_socialism) if they're interested in anti-corporate, anti-government political theory. Any realistic change can only come from grassroots organising, campaign finance reform and alternate publicly owned institutions. ",

But this democracy is always hemmed in by the narrow limits set by capitalist exploitation, and consequently always remains, in effect, a democracy for the minority, only for the propertied classes, only for the rich. **Freedom in capitalist society always remains about the same as it was in the ancient Greek republics: freedom for the slave-owners.** Owing to the conditions of capitalist exploitation, **the modern wage slaves are so crushed by want and poverty that \"they cannot be bothered with democracy\", \"cannot be bothered with politics\"; in the ordinary, peaceful course of events, the majority of the population is debarred from participation in public and political life...**\nDemocracy for an insignificant minority, democracy for the rich--that is the democracy of capitalist society. If we look more closely into the machinery of capitalist democracy, we see everywhere, in the \u201cpetty\u201d--supposedly petty--details of the suffrage (residential qualifications, exclusion of women, etc.), in the technique of the representative institutions, in the actual obstacles to the right of assembly (public buildings are not for \u201cpaupers\u201d!), in the purely capitalist organization of the daily press, etc., etc.,--we see restriction after restriction upon democracy. These restrictions, exceptions, exclusions, obstacles for the poor seem slight, especially in the eyes of one who has never known want himself and has never been inclose contact with the oppressed classes in their mass life (and nine out of 10, if not 99 out of 100, bourgeois publicists and politicians come under this category); but in their sum total these restrictions exclude and squeeze out the poor from politics, from active participation in democracy.\"\n\n\n",

That is 5% of what it should be for over 2x the price.\n\nThe DOJ targeted the SDRAM industry when they inexplicably deviated from Moore's Law and took action.  We need to tell the FCC that they need to protect the consumer and force broadband providers to explain this detail.\n\nThe other thing everyone should emphasize with the FCC is that it doesn't matter whether or not an individual at the FCC *is* *corrupt*.

Some bigger banks were purged by indebted Kings who decided they didn't like the power their creditors had (nevermind that the king agreed to the loans at the time); many of these institutions were operated by Jewish people (part of what made the Jewish population a tempting scapegoat for pissed off Europeans throughout history).\n\nThe East India Trading Company and other such institutions held immense power over British politics in the early days of American colonization.

If you feel safer with a gun, you're going to argue against gun control. Etc. Etc. Etc.\n\nAll of human civilization is about trying to create a situation that benefits you specifically (morally, financially, sexually, emotionally, whatever) and trying to prevent anything that will hurt that. But that also creates a natural balance, because there are always people with opposite interests.\n\nThe problem is, money allows you to tip the scale in your favour, so with these super rich entities they are actually getting their way despite everyone else. And these entities, these companies, aren't human. They're run by humans but let's say Pai or this Verizon VP or whoever in charge gets fired, nothing changes. The goals and means of the company stay the same. It won't end with anyone dying or quitting or having a change of heart. They'll keep taking and taking no matter the cost.",

The telecoms are not primarily gas lighting, although there is a little of that going on (as with Pai's suggestion that throttling has not happened in the past, and so does not require regulation), they are outright lying and spreading disinformation about the purpose and specific content of proposed rewrites of regulations, as well as disinformation about what net neutrality guarantees to average users.\n\nWhat is actually happening I guess you could call shotgunning lies: just spraying lies everywhere all the time.

So now Corporation A gives their CEO a special bonus each year to donate to \"the candidate or cause of their choice,\" which mysteriously goes to the same party or cause every year.\n\n2) See above.\n\nThe core problem will still exist, that campaign finance is totally borked.  That's what needs to be overhauled if we're to see any changes.  But even then, as someone else pointed out in another thread, you have the issue of the nature of the job.  Congressional members are elected for a job that basically ends their career in most cases.  Almost any other job in politics is a step backwards, so they either do everything they can to stay in Congress, or they accept bribes in the form of \"job offers\" from corporations, where their \"job\" could be just sitting at home.\n\nTerm limits and campaign finance reform could change the entire political landscape because it would draw out people who actually want to make positive change (whatever positive change meant to them).  It would make serving in Congress an honor rewarded by positions on councils, committees, and other boards that provide political perspective and advice.\n\nI've actually considered a system where anyone who agrees to serve in Congress is financially bound to a certain income cap for the rest of their lives, but every model I consider has gaps and exploits.  Bribery can't be legislated against because there are too many ways to bribe.  It has to be a cultural thing, and that just will never happen.\n\nBottom line is, and always will be, that we need to demand better of those in government than we do of ourselves.  We need to elect people who are resistant to corruption.  And that's not how our society views government, which allows the corruption to proliferate.",
