As an audience member it is pretty hard to resist, and for journalists these days the consolidation occurring in the industry means they have to worry about their livelihood.  If clickbait puts food on the table ... what a tough call versus a more dispassionate presentation of the facts.\n\nSupport your local non-sensationalist investigative journalist.  They are needed more and more.  I don't think that *necessarily* means avoiding advertiser-funded journalism, but support journalism that knows where to draw the line between self-interest and good reporting.\n\nI buy access to the local paper even though I think I get the time to read only about a quarter of the days.

Before him, sexual abuse and similar offenses were dealt with on a diocese (local) level, and he made it such that all cases must be made public and reported to/dealt with by the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith (part of the Roman Curia in Rome, formed to combat heresy in the Church). He actually got a lot of flak for this, because it \"publicized\" a lot of the previously unknown/under-wraps sexual abuse cases. It was oftentimes reported as a sort of scandal because suddenly a bunch of sex scandals were appearing, when actually it was *because* he made it such because he felt the \"local\" level was too forgiving, and he wanted more accountability and efficiency in dealing with the situations. He required more priests to be defrocked for this too (lose their priest role). I also appreciated he tapped out of the job when he felt he was not mentally well enough to continue. It sets a good precedent for future popes I think, as before this you just did it until you died, and people can get pretty senile towards the end.\n\nHe was not nearly as charismatic as Pope Francis or John Paul II, and bore an unfortunately vivid resemblance to Darth Sideous, but he's a great guy. I also appreciated he tapped out of the job when he felt he was not mentally well enough to continue.

    "body": "Because they're practicing their culture and then use Christianity to validate it. Christian doctrine doesn't support what these evangelicals are espousing and that's why the Pope mentioned this. However, shitty cultural aspects in the US clearly do. It's a case of these people trying to apply their shitty culture with Christianity. It's the same in Islam. Social conservatives will bring the cart before the horse. They have socially conservative values that they then try to validate with whatever religion they supposedly espouse, which they themselves and many others conflate as being qualities of that religion. The difference is that society generally accepts that some regressive goat herder in a village in the middle of no where is representative of Islam, while some bumfucks in Alabama that wanted to elect a pedophile to the senate aren't accepted as representative of Christianity in US society. The reason there isn't huge condemnation by Muslims over Islamists committing terrorism is because they don't identify with them and have no responsibility for them. It doesn't make sense for them to say, \"hey, we need to stop our own from doing this.\" You see the same with Christians when some loon commits a terrorist act in the US. There's no wide spread, societal condemnation by Christians like when that guy who claimed God told him to shoot up Planned Parenthood in Colorado because that man isn't representative of the religion or Christians at large. It's regressive people with regressive values that use religion to validate their shit, which in turn causes conflation between their culture and religion.",

The issues you brought up regarding the Eucharist are tradition based (not dogmatic) and the \"heresy\" Pope Francis was accused of consisted of schismatic, illicit Catholic groups who have broken from the Catholic Church rules and do not follow the pope. \n\nFor those who do not know, Catholic may not receive the Eucharist in a state of mortal sin. Divorce falls into that category. You must have your marriage \"annulled\" first. However, the process takes a long time due to the due process and would oftentimes result in Catholics not being able to receive the Eucharist for years because they were \"in a state of mortal sin\" due to their paperwork not being pushed through yet. Pope Francis basically said this was bullocks, and that all this was doing was pushing people away from the Church. If the person involved sought full communion with the Church and was actively seeking it out (i.e. waiting for their forms to be pushed through, essentially) they were not in a state of mortal sin and could receive the Eucharist. This angered a lot of schismatic and ultra-conservative (i.e. political more than religious) \"Catholic\" groups and was received positively by most else as a very Jesus-like thing to do, being focused on forgiveness, reconciliation, and reunion while keeping the base rules of the person actually seeking full communion with the Church.",

I just feel like the Catholic church is used as a punching bag sometimes when all religions can be used to justify some horrendous things.\n\nAlso, the crusades are often portrayed as basically unprompted aggression, but in context it was more complicated than that \n\nThe roman empire and the catholic church with it had split into east and western halves.  The western roman empire fell, but remained in a way through the Catholic church.  If you view the Catholic church as the last vestiges of the roman empire, and the orthodox churches as the last vestiges of the byzantine empire.. together they are the last vestiges of the roman empire.  Then it makes a little more sense that the shattered remains of the western roman empire would send troops to help defend the byzantine empire from the Ottoman turks. \n\nEdit (added random thoughts that I took way too long typing out): \n\nGoing even further back, you have the Roman empire fighting the Carthaginians, who were an offshoot of the Phoenicians, who had a city called Tyre, which is in Lebanon.  These costal cities were essentially the rich decadent pagans that the Jews were fighting for a lot of the bible.  \n\nThey could have been the remains of societies formed in the Old Assyrican empire.  Palestine (or \"philistine\" in arabic), was Canaan and the jews were inland in the mountains and became an inland empire while the carthaginians were creating a trade network throughout what is now the Arab world. Meanwhile, on the other side were the Babylonians, who were probably also closely related to the Assyrian empire.  So you could see the old testament as basically the story of some hillbillies freeing themselves from an ever more corrupt fallen Assyrian hegemony.  \n\nWhen societies fall, they don't just totally collapse.  People still live in the cities they lived in before they were conquered, and they still have the same connections.  History class likes to make it seem like just because the Greeks took over some cities in India, boom, they're greek.  Everyone has to build their houses the Greek way.  And then when they took it back over, boom, no more Greece, everyone stops building their houses the Greek way. \n\nIn reality, they were probably trading with those kingdoms in India for a while before, and Alexander the Great was just kind of a hawkish warmonger who decided to take over.  Most people probably just wanted to chill and fish.  Also, probably 1/2 or more wasn't taken by force, but through either immediate surrender or corrupt deals where the mayor got bribed or something.  \n\nSo when the Roman empire fell, the state governments probably just took over and still tried to prop up the structure they had before, but the corruption was just festering and eating away at it too much. \n\nAnyway, that's my view of history. \n\n\n",

He's not.\n\nJust a few verses later Jesus tells the woman who had been caught in adultery to \"go, and from now on sin no more.\"\n\nThen Chapter 8 gets really interesting because Jesus begins revealing his authority why we should listen to what he is saying. He begins to reveal that He and God the Father are the same. \"If you knew me, you would know my Father also.\u201d\n\nSo now what do we do with that information? Jesus can't just be a good teacher who said some things people like. He's claiming status equal to the Creator of all things. This leaves us with the options of studying all that he said within the context of both the Old and New Testaments or dismiss him as a crazy man with a God complex. \n\nWhat say you?",

After they leave the White House grounds he expresses his doubts to Dave, who again implores him to name anyone else.\n\n\"Pope Francis,\" his boss replies.\n\n\"Sure!\" says Dave. \"I've known the Pope for years.\" So off they fly to Rome.\n\nDave and his boss are assembled with the masses at the Vatican's St. Peter's Square when Dave says, \"This will never work.

Tell you what, I know all the guards so let me just go upstairs and I'll come out on the balcony with the Pope.\" He disappears into the crowd headed towards the Vatican.\n\nSure enough, half an hour later Dave emerges with the Pope on the balcony, but by the time Dave returns, he finds that his boss has had a heart attack and is surrounded by paramedics.\n\nMaking his way to his boss' side, Dave asks him, \"What happened?\"\n\nHis boss looks up and says, \"It was the final straw... you and the Pope came out on to the balcony and the man next to me said, 'Who the fuck is that on the balcony with Dave?'",

But I think that a lot of the vocal people (not counting trolls) don't understand that they're not doing a service to their religion.\n\nIt's much more efficient if you are just a nice guy in general, if someone asks you tell them \"yes, I'm religious\" and if they want to talk about it you let them lead.\n\nUnless you're literally going to poor countries and giving them food and blankets along with an optional Bible, that is.
