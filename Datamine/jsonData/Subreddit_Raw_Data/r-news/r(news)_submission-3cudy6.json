Ellen Pao was a terrible leader for Reddit and completely alienated it's users. In the business world it makes complete sense for her to leave: she caused a near complete walkout on her company and a huge increase in traffic to her rivals, who were previously unknown. That is a complete and utter business failure. The Times would love  to have had Ellen Pao ripped apart because she was a woman in the Internet industry, but she was simply atrocious at her job.

There was no evidence or claim that she was directly responsible for that incident at all and yet the protest/response was quickly consumed by people focusing all their frustration at Pao specifically.\n\nI hadn't considered that this was her intended role in the first place, but now that you mention it I even wonder if some of the more dominant anti-Pao posts were actually astro-turfing to manipulate the dialogue from both sides.\n\nA bit of a geeky reference, but as an example I think back to when D.C. was doing the Batman Incorporated storyline and Bruce Wayne came out publicly as funding Batman's vigilantism. Afterwards in the comics run you could see glimpses of him on the batcomputer taking part in internet debates on whether Bruce Wayne was Batman, with Batman himself controlling multiple accounts and arguing on both sides of the issue in order to manipulate the entire discussion.\n\nLike people have already pointed out, sure one ceo got swapped for an old one but there has been no commitment made to any actual change in policy and yet the issue is almost certainly finished in any meaningful degree. A brilliant tactic if you are planning to implement goal changes that you know will receive a loud, public backlash.\n\nPao was reddit's New Coke and now they're giving us Coke Classic.",

No one one here has ever been mad about attempted monetization. In fact, Reddit Gold has been supported by the community because it was done in a way that preserved the integrity of the community, and thus preserved the value of the site for the users.\n\nThe recent actions taken by Reddit, on the other hand, have only focused on the monetization side of the equation, which is, again, exactly the problem.",

I used to confront these people with what could be considered vitriol under the assumption that believing what they did was detrimental to society, and more importantly that they were consciously choosing an opinion of ignorance. \n\nWhile their ideas were certainly ill conceived, attacking them personally achieved nothing. It never would. People are proud. They do not respond to aggressive criticism and it will never help them change their point of view. \n\nInstead of trying to argue a stance, I eventually found myself just asking questions. 'Why do you believe that? What do you think about this other aspect? If I were to tell you that you can find (X) information here, would you consider reconciling that with your beliefs?'\n\nTLDR - I guess what I'm saying is that I can't get angry for people who haven't spent time forming a nuanced opinion. On any issue. I repeat, any issue. \n\nWe only have so much time and energy to learn, and it accomplishes nothing to blame someone personally for having incomplete information. Instead, I try to share what I know in the hopes that positive communication and a sincerity to share and  teach will affect change. \n",
