    "body": "Okay this comment section is really one of the worst I've ever seen. Can we talk reasonably about the story and the implications of denying green card holders access to their homes? Just scrolling through I've seen a huge amount of false equivalence and outright despicable comments regarding this story. \n\nSo what if BLM happened to act irresponsibly that one time? If so then hold them accountable AND hold Trump and his team accountable for the shoddy way this was implemented and how it affected real people. So what if you disliked Obama's drone program? If you do hold him accountable AND Trump. Don't point to bad behavior to justify or minimize other bad behavior. \n\nThe tragedy here, IMO, is that this kind of think was easily avoidable and, as far as I can tell, there is no factual justification the White House presented for such a rushed and extreme position as we saw on Sunday. Supporters of this order rarely move beyond repeating base claims about security and border protection and terrorism. I haven't seen a single comment trying to justify the extent of this policy using any data or evidence. Anyone who is actually involved in national security policy, counterterrorism, counter violent extremism, and international relations sees how hollow and ill-planned and executed the order was. \n\nThe concerns about refugees are factually overblown. The US has among the most rigorous and time consuming refugee acceptance policies. The concerns about immigrants and travelers to this country are also greatly exaggerated. Our Visa program is also comparatively rigorous. Additionally, the actual numbers regarding terror attacks do not support the travel ban on the listed countries. The vast majority of terror attacks on this country since 9/11 have been from legal residents and citizens that were radicalized. \n\nHow does radicalization happen? Through recruitment and propaganda. Precipitous actions such as this order fuel such propaganda efforts and engender bitterness and separatism. Arguments that say \"well if they are that easily radicalized it would have happened anyway\" simply do not take into account the large scale and long term process of radicalization. Such arguments are shallow and only serve as attempts to dismiss the seriousness of America further alienating Muslim communities.\n\nI know many people are set in their ways when it comes to supporting one political side or the other, but I implore people to please think critically about what best serves our security interests. Also think seriously about the human cost of these programs and whether they are effective and worth that cost. It's easy to have a simple position, but things are rarely so simple. Read articles and arguments from experts who dedicate their careers to these issues. Don't take Trump's word for it. Don't take Democrat's word about it either. If people want to have a strong opinion I encourage them to educate themselves on these issues. Otherwise we're just yelling at each other.\n\n\n\nEdit: A lot of people have been rightly asking for sources so I'm going to try to add some. My initial response was reactive because I saw so few comments actually trying to engage with the issues and I didn't take the time to dig up some relevant sources. A couple people below suggested some so I'll add links if anyone is interested.\n\nThink tank analysis of where terrorists come from and how it relates to immigrants.\nhttps://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/pubs/pdf/pa798_1_1.pdf\n\nExplanation of Visa Procedures\nhttps://travel.state.gov/content/visas/en/law-and-policy/bulletin/2017/visa-bulletin-for-february-2017.html\n\nAtlantic article on the Trump executive order and terrorism\nhttps://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2017/01/trump-immigration-ban-terrorism/514361/\n\nCNN infographic on odds of terror attacks in the US\nhttp://www.cnn.com/2017/01/30/politics/immigration-stats-by-the-numbers-trnd/\n\nStanford article on radicalization on engaging Muslim communities\nhttp://news.stanford.edu/2016/03/17/terrorism-muslims-inclusion-031716/\n\nBrennan Center analysis of the process of radicalization\nhttps://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/legacy/RethinkingRadicalization.pdf\n\nNYT article briefly outlining the refugee process.\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/01/29/us/refugee-vetting-process.html\n\nPBS interview with former head of US Counter Terrorism Center\nhttp://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/immigration-ban-misses-greatest-threat-counterterrorism-expert-says/\n\n**Edit 2:** I'm having a hard time finding detailed support of the executive order from third party organizations like think tanks or from current or former professionals in related fields. If anyone has links to some I'd love to read them. Best I've found through a casual google dig was this one interviewing a think tank director, but it doesn't seem particularly in-depth.\nhttps://www.pri.org/stories/2017-01-31/why-policy-expert-supports-trumps-immigration-ban\n\n**Final Edit:** Just want to say the comments got *a lot* better as time went on. There's a lot of good discussion in the topic now and I feel a lot better about it. Thanks to everybody who engaged with me!\n\n**Final Final Edit**: Thought I was done with this comment but it seems to be coming to people's attention that the story originating this thread is fake (at least according to the another local news report). Getting a bunch of messages arguing that this invalidates my points and that I'm a sucker for giving the story any credence. I felt this deserves a quick response and I'll do it here so I don't feel the need to respond to every one of these comments. Regardless of if the story is true I still believe there is the very real potential for harm to come of this order. \n\nAt the time of my original posting no one knew the full extent of the circumstances, and my initial response was about mean spirited comments and false equivalencies regarding the broader issues surrounding the executive order. All of that holds true. While I certainly gave credence to the article and gave the report the benefit of the doubt (Although I admitted in many responses that I wasn't certain of the details in the story) the wider points I was trying to make remain valid. \n\nWe should try to be balanced and respectful when we talk about issues. It is unfortunate that this news story may have been fake because it will distract from the thousands of people who are prevented from going about the plans and lives because of the order. If people are disillusioned  by this I understand, but I also ask they still read up on the issue and form opinions based on concerns of the efficacy, human costs, financial costs, motivations, and implementation of the executive order. Thanks for all the people who sent respectful and thoughtful comments in supporting and against my position.",

I really like the sources you provide for each claim.\n\nHowever, to play devil's advocate here, from my own experience with Fox news viewers, they have somehow performed the mental gymnastics necessary to discredit all these real, credible sources you've cited.\nA 2010 Stanford University survey found \"more exposure to Fox News was associated with more rejection of many mainstream scientists' claims about global warming, [and] with less trust in scientists\".[75]\n\nA Fox viewer would argue \"the polls and experts were wrong about the election; y'all don't know shit.\" Despite the study coming from one of the best universities in the country.\n\nIn regards to citing CNN, the nytimes,  snopes, and the dailybeast, many Fox viewers believe these organizations produce fake news and aren't likely to read these sources, much less believe them.\n\nMedia Matters is an organization Fox viewers believe is owned by George Soros even though he has donated less than 8% of all donations.  Furthermore, Media Matters is believed to own many of the major \"leftist\" news networks when all it really does is monitor them.\n\nMy question to everyone is this.  If Fox viewers are so adamantly opposed to facts and evidence, how in the world are we supposed to convince them to even consider a different point of view?",

It's like a pass which says \"this guy isn't a full fledged American citizen, but he's been in the country for over 10 years (some posts here say it's 20 year limit to process a GC), passed every background check we can throw at him, so let him through immigration\"\n\nIt's why there is a seperate line for US passport holders and Permanent residents and another line for foreign citizens and passport holders at immigration and Customs. But PR's and GCs still carry their original country passports so they're effectively dual citizens.\n\nSo the fact that Trump is holding up GC/Permanent Residents for \"more screening\" is just his cop out for promising \"extreme Xtream vetting\" during the campaign. You literally cannot screen them anymore, so just keep them held up at immigration asking the same questions they've been asked over and over again during the PR process. \n\nNow, Obama did pass a law mandating dual citizens returning from the six blacklisted countries to go through an additional round of questioning. But Trump has extended that to effectively say all GC holders from these countries, regardless of where they are returning from, need to be held until they clear six to seven hours of further screening. It's literally more bureaucratic red tape, not additional security. Funny how easy it is to mix those two up. \n\nAlso the reason why you can't find detailed news on this is because even ICE and DHS frontline staff are unsure how to effectively implement this order. So they're all ad-libing their way through it depending on how their superiors interpret and apply the rules. ",

He sees WW2 as a war between righteous Christians and an atheist state. What is interesting here (sub conscious?) he does not outright call out the Nazis, he calls them an atheist state, he says \"Continental Europe was taken back\" while rightly calling Japan a \"barbaric Empire in the East\", his racism to me leaks through here also.\n\nHe then says that the \"good Capitalism, backed by the Judeo Christian faith\" is dying and replaced by the state sponsored model...he then says something that is objectively false,\n\n\"And it doesn\u2019t spread the tremendous value creation throughout broader distribution patterns that were seen really in the 20th century.\" \n\nChina has literally pulled the most number of people out of poverty in human history, but our good friend Bannon does not even think that this is a broad based distribution of wealth.\n\nHe then rails on Libertarianism for a bit.\n\nHe next talks about increasing secularisation, and how it is a really bad thing. \n\nNext comes something that is a strong indicator on how this administration is going to run things - he thinks that the ISIS and the growth of Islamic Jihadism is a global conflagration and that it is only the start of a global war. \n\nHe said this in 2014, and today we know that the ISIS is a shadow if its power from 3 years ago, the BH is on the run and is restricted to small pockets of influence and are not the same threats they were 3 years ago.\n\nTowards the end he makes it clear that he is anti abortion, anti gay marriages (might explain the abortion defunding by Trump).\n\nHe then talks a lot about crony capitalism and 2008 crisis (the only sensible things he says imo) and how the bailouts were criminal and that not pressing criminal charges on bankers was wrong etc etc.\n\nThe telling thing comes towards the end where to a question on the biggest threat facing the world today he says Secularism is a greater threat than fundamentalist Islam.\n\nHis views on Putin are also interesting, he says that he broadly agrees with Putin's methods in fostering and sustaining nationalism and what Bannon calls 'traditional values', but adds a disclaimer that Putin is an imperialist who runs a kleptocracy and needs to be checked, but only after other threats (Islam) is dealt with first.\n\nThis guy is cancer and thank you America, the whole world has to deal with whatever shit he whispers in his puppet, Lord Cheeto's ear which would become law in the US.",

Additionally, if you buy what Bannon has talked about in the past he sees conflict with the Islamic world as an inevitable Clash of Civilizations.

Anyway, I commented asking him about how everything was from his point of view and how he felt about it. We had a small back and forth regarding things there vs here and about how more people should be standing up for what they believe in, etc. \n\nI asked him how *so many* people are able to come together and protest something, mainly because I don't think we would ever see something on that scale here. But he mentioned that the reason is because people get their news and gossip at local hang out spots. He likened it to facebook, where people would just rant about things that got people fired up, noting that we would definitely have the kind of numbers and participation in things like protests if we weren't just pissed off about this *behind a screen*. He said it was easy when 50-100 guys get together and pissed off about something and end up spilling out of the shop/someone's house and walking through the streets yelling about an issue because then everyone at their house hears it and decides they're on board too. After a while the crowd will grow exponentially.  \n\nAnyway, your comment hit home. Fabulously worded and honestly, this would be an amazing slogan to get people fired up. \nJust hopefully enough for them to *get up.*",

The previous time I did it, this is how it went:\n- Go online to check the relevant documents required.\n- Have a question about it, call the Consulate and get an easy answer.\n- Gather the paperwork and head to the Consulate when I get a moment.\n- Hand the paperwork in, have a chat about upcoming Consulate events and be on my way.\n\nNow the whole thing has been handed over to a private company who handle visas and passport renewals. This is how it goes:\n- Go online to check the relevant documents required.\n- Have a question about it so look for the phone number... there isn't one.\n- Send an email to the \"helpline\" email address and get an automated response stating \"This email address is for making appointments ONLY. Questions will NOT be answered. If you have questions, go to the government website.\"\n- Go to the government website, spend some time searching for the email address and send the question. Wait a week, because the poor buggers are now handling questions from all over the fucking world.\n- Gather the documents, and email the \"helpline\" to make an appointment\n- Wait several days for a reply\n- Arrive for the appointment (following strict instructions not to arrive any earlier than 15min before the scheduled time)\n- Find I need to do the whole document discussion in Chinese (probably because hiring English speakers will cut into the profits)... yeah, think about that: a British citizen needing to speak Chinese in order to renew a British passport!\n- Get asked if that's everything I need to hand in, because they have no fucking idea.\n- Successfully manage to leave the building without stapling someone's upper lip to the desk in pure rage.\n\nHOW THE FUCK IS THIS CONSIDERED \"BETTER\"??? iT'S NOT! Private companies get the contract for government services and then only give a shit about the bottom line because it would take thousands and thousands of customer complaints to even create the slightest risk to their business model.
