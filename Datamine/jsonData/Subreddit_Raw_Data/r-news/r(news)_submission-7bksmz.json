Someone initially charged with running a red light might also be charged with reckless driving later on, depending on what the rest of the investigation reveals.\n\nThe comments this girl made certainly sound like admissions of prostitution (illegal), and more notably sound like an effort to bribe an officer with an offer of sex in exchange for leniency.  The officer chose to charge her with DUI at the scene, but he appropriately recorded other pertinent information which the prosecutor might want to review.  \n\nLet's say the same scenario happened but the suspect made the comment that he made money from selling drugs and offered the officer some of the drug money in exchange for leniency.  Still an admission of unrelated criminal conduct, still an offer of a bribe related to that conduct, right?  The officer might elect to go easy on a drunk guy and only cite him for DUI, but would we not still expect him to note that this man had admitted being a drug dealer and drunkenly tried to bribe a cop?  That's the kind of thing that leads to further investigation and potentially to additional charges being filed after the arrest.\n\n100% good policework by the cop, including his exercise of restraint in only citing her for the immediate crime.

This is where your morals and character come into the picture, you want to be cool with the other shitty cops or tell the truth and be judged by your peers and possibly lose your career? I'll take the high road because my parents taught me better, but honestly some cops are just pieces of shit. \n\nI've worked with some cops that talk to people like they are garbage, they come on scenes that you have calmed down and stir up shit. I treat people the way I want to be treated, just because I have a badge and gun doesn't mean I'm better than anyone. Don't get me wrong, some people you just can't talk to in the nicest time and if they want to throw hands then so be it. I'm in Danny Glover mode after 15 years of policing \"I'm getting to old for this shit\". When you work with good officers and you have a turd that stirs up shit, we let that guy know that if someone swings on you for talking to them like an ass, that's on you. I'm glad this dude took a stand for whats right, it's hard but that's what needs to be done. \n\nHell if anyone has police questions, feel free to pm me anytime!",

Depending on one's place of employment mistakes are dangerous. A fire department or municipal EMS company will have their employees back. A lot of privates will cut loose people who screw up as a liability. There's an attitude of see something say nothing, and if you speak up and out someone for doing anything wrong or dangerous you'll be allocated as a snitch. Again this depends on department atmosphere and is more common in for profits where education is not emphasized. It's sad really.\n\nEdit: in reality if you're honest about a mistake your medical control will support you if you were working towards a patients best interests but lot of people in EMS are not willing to accept responsibility for their actions and see a mistake as failure and remediation as proving incompetence. This leads to lies and situations which put people's partners in awkward situations",

    "body": "It's unfortunate but it's people like this who try to cover up incidents like these instead of facing them in the open that contribute to the stigma that exists around addiction.  Addiction treatment is so severely lacking in this country and beyond facing the social stigma, difficulty in obtaining access to adequate medical treatment is another serious danger to these patients.  Maybe those suffering with an addiction, like this judge's daughter, wouldn't slip so far into their addiction if they weren't so afraid to admit they have a problem in the first place because of how they will be treated by friends/family/doctors.  Or  if they didn't have to wait 3 months to get into a treatment program.   What it's going to take to really start to shift society's view on addiction is for people like this self-serving judge to bring these issues to the  public instead of trying to sweep it under the rug.   To remind everyone that this is a problem that exists with no regard to race, color, creed, economic status or position of power.  And that we all need to work together as a community and help one another if we are ever going to overcome this current crisis.  People with the kind of inlfuence that this judge carries are the ones who could be speaking out and making a difference.  As far as I'm concerned, if he really cared about what's best for his family, he would be doing everything in his power to make sure his daughter and millions of other people's daughters in the same situation can seek and actually receive in a timely fashion the care they need without being painted as a criminal or as somehow less than human.  Not by commanding someone to alter records to \"protect their privacy\". Sorry about the rant, I consider this to be such an abuse of his position and a betrayal of the people and the system he is supposed to represent and it really fires me up.

Lots of people never get this help and it's so easy to forget that these are people. This judge is not doing what's best but it's his daughter. Addicts are someone's family. My mom was an addict and she did bad things, but that's the life she was raised into.
