    "body": "[*edit*: TL;DR: 'and/or' simply provides Judges leeway. These sentencing guidelines are a good thing, numbers aside.]\n\nI see a bunch of comments from people that don't get the \"and/or\" thing.  I want to clarify it, because it's important to understand how it works and why it's there in the sentencing guidelines.  At the Judge's discretion, he can use use either punishment, or both. This is a good thing. Mandatory sentences are not a good thing, in my opinion. Flexibility is important. Circumstances and intent matter. Look at these two examples:\n\nscenario#1: Joe, a steelworker in Irontown, leaves for work on Monday. Distracted by fatigue, a hangover, and his pressing credit card debt, he backs out of his driveway without first doing a 360 check and he kills a pedestrian. He's wrought with guilt and remorse, drowning in more debt from legal fees and from being fired well before his trial. The Judge, when considering Joe's sentence, decides that jailing Joe would serve no purpose, but that a moderate fine, some community service and a criminal record will be a just punishment.\n\nscenario#2: The situation in Flint, where a handful of people knowingly poisoned a large community. The Judge could decide that some of the defendants are more culpable than others, and levy fines on some and lengthy prison sentences on the others.\n\nI'm not a lawyer, and I guess that vehicular manslaughter is different than 'regular' manslaughter, but you get what I'm saying? It's not like the defendants get to pick between jail or a fine.  The Judge chooses a combination of both, or just one.  It gives them a lot of latitude in sentencing.  That's all.",

They're not being charged for people getting sick from lead poisoning, they're being charged because the Flint River was being used as a water source just before and during a Legionnaire's outbreak that killed 12 people. Specifically, the charges are tied to one of those deaths, the death of Robert Skidmore, who died Dec. 13, 2015 from the outbreak.\n\nWhile the people being charged suspected that the Flint River was the source of the Legionnaire's outbreak, it took Nick Lyon, the director of the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), over *a year* to tell the governor this. In addition, Dr. Eden Wells, chief medical executive of DHHS, was charged with \"knowingly provided false testimony\" to an investigator and \"threatening to withhold funding for the Flint Area Community Health and Environmental Partnership if the partnership did not cease its investigation\". \n\nNasty shit, gotta say.

The spray painted run down apartment complexes, half burnt but still occupied because they have nowhere else to go...? The empty homes of people who were evicted for not paying tainted water bills? Almost the entire city is a food desert (Google it) and violent crime is rife. \n\nMaybe you're thinking of the burbs, Grand Blanc, perhaps? Or just inside of the public market? Those are nice areas in an otherwise blighted town. \n\nI lived next to a boat landing in Flint, in a tiny, quiet group of nice homes on a 3-way dead end dirt road. Nothing ever happened there except kids playing too loudly in the street. The city was shit storming around us, but we were OK. \n\nOne night in January, while we were sleeping, our bedroom window had 15 large caliber rounds blown through it right over our heads. They exited the other window at our feet. There were witnesses but no one has been caught to charge. The current status is 'wanted for felonious assault'. \n\nFlint IS exactly as fucked up as everyone says, either you're in the denial or you have a tight community that makes up for the other shit (which I see from another one of your replies is the case.). There's a deep desperation in Flint that I haven't seen before and I've lived in some troubled cities. We moved south, and we are safe, but we're still in Flint frequently.\n\nI'm really not trying to be a jerk - come on. It's not good. Don't pretend it is. You make people think it's ok there and you're lessening the struggle of others\n\nBtw: it IS a problem with the water system... Not a house by house basis. That's why it's a crisis and they have to rip up a ton of the grid. It's not the *entire* water system, which is why not everyone was effected. Where exactly have you been getting your news this entire time?",

    "body": "These kinds of problems are happening all over the United States. There are also many routes of exposure besides drinking water, and tons of contaminants besides lead (like 90,000). \n\n--------------------------\n\nCompanies openly pollute rivers and lakes. \n\n\"[Records analyzed by The New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/13/us/13water.html) indicate that the Clean Water Act has been violated more than 506,000 times since 2004, by more than 23,000 companies and other facilities, according to reports submitted by polluters themselves. Companies sometimes test what they are dumping only once a quarter, so the actual number of days when they broke the law is often far higher. And some companies illegally avoid reporting their emissions, say officials, so infractions go unrecorded.\" (article written in 2009)\n\nThis is a conservative estimate according to the points mentioned in that article.\n\nNew York Times: \"Many Americans assume that the chemicals in their shampoos, detergents and other consumer products have been thoroughly tested and proved to be safe. This assumption is wrong. Unlike pharmaceuticals or pesticides, [industrial chemicals do not have to be tested before they are put on the market.\"](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/14/sunday-review/think-those-chemicals-have-been-tested.html?_r=0) Under the law regulating chemicals, producers are only rarely required to provide the federal government with the information necessary to assess safety.\n\nWashington Post:  \"[Of the 84,000 chemicals in commercial use in the United States -- from flame retardants in furniture to household cleaners -- nearly 20 percent are secret,](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/01/03/AR2010010302110.html) according to the Environmental Protection Agency, their names and physical properties guarded from consumers and virtually all public officials under a little-known federal provision. The policy was designed 33 years ago to protect trade secrets in a highly competitive industry. But critics -- including the Obama administration -- say the secrecy has grown out of control, making it impossible for regulators to control potential dangers or for consumers to know which toxic substances they might be exposed to.\"\n\nNew York Times: [\"Only 91 contaminants are regulated by the Safe Drinking Water Act, yet more than 60,000 chemicals are used within the United States, according to EPA estimates.\"](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/17/us/17water.html) (2009)\n\nAnd of the chemicals that are regulated, sometimes we find out that the tests were fudged or faked to make the water seem fine, when in fact it was not.\n\n- The Guardian: [US authorities distorting tests to downplay lead content of water](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jan/22/water-lead-content-tests-us-authorities-distorting-flint-crisis) \n\n- CNN: [5,300 U.S. water systems are in violation of lead rules](http://www.cnn.com/2016/06/28/us/epa-lead-in-u-s-water-systems/)\n\nHere are a few local examples of water quality report falsification:\n\n- \"NYC fudged records to show day care centers\u2019 water was tested for lead, but no tests were performed. DOHMH \u2014 the agency that's required to inspect all 11,000 child care centers in New York City annually \u2014 [had more or less given up on the task.\"](http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-faked-day-care-centers-lead-water-level-test-records-article-1.2686760)\n\n- [Sparta man admits falsifying drinking-water test results for two community water systems and five private wells in order to meet state water-testing requirements.](http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2008/12/sparta_man_and_his_andover_lab.html)\n\n- [Former Water Commission Official Admits to Falsifying Test Results](http://patch.com/new-jersey/westorange/former-water-commission-official-admits-falsifying-test-results)\n\n- [Mississippi Laboratory Operator Found Guilty of Falsifying Records on Industrial Wastewater](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/mississippi-laboratory-operator-found-guilty-falsifying-records-industrial-wastewater)\n\n\nPeople may not be notified when their drinking water is failing a test.\n\n>While a harsh national spotlight focuses on the drinking water crisis in Flint, Mich., a USA TODAY NETWORK investigation has identified almost 2,000 additional water systems spanning all 50 states where testing has shown excessive levels of lead contamination over the past four years.\n\n>The water systems, which reported lead levels exceeding Environmental Protection Agency standards, collectively supply water to 6 million people. About 350 of those systems provide drinking water to schools or day cares. The USA TODAY NETWORK investigation also found at least 180 of the water systems failed to notify consumers about the high lead levels as federal rules require. https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2016/03/11/nearly-2000-water-systems-fail-lead-tests/81220466/\n\nBecause of [The Lead Lobby](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2509614/), a lot of the city pipes that carry your water (not just pipes in your house) contain high levels of lead. Many of these are still in use. \n\nA good example of what happens under these conditions is [Dupont's \"C8,\" which caused a variety of medical problems for surrounding populations.](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/10/magazine/the-lawyer-who-became-duponts-worst-nightmare.html) It was also expensive and time-consuming to [figure out what Dupont replaced C8 with, and that chemical was also making its way into a nearby river.](https://theintercept.com/2016/03/03/how-dupont-concealed-the-dangers-of-the-new-teflon-toxin/)\n\n\n*What has been done about this  so far?*\n\n>It could take centuries for EPA to test all the unregulated chemicals under a new landmark bill. \n\n>Synthetic chemicals surround us. They\u2019re in our takeout containers, children\u2019s toys, furniture and clothes. There\u2019s BPA in our receipts and flame retardants in our children\u2019s carseats. You might think the government has carefully reviewed every chemical for safety before it hits the market. But it hasn\u2019t. **In fact, there are more than 80,000 chemicals registered for use today, many of which haven\u2019t been studied for safety by any government agency.**\n\n>The new law requires EPA to test tens of thousands of unregulated chemicals currently on the market, and the roughly 2,000 new chemicals introduced each year, but quite slowly. The EPA will review a minimum of 20 chemicals at a time, and each has a seven-year deadline. Industry may then have five years to comply after a new rule is made. **At that pace it could take centuries for the agency to finish its review.**\n\n>\u201cThe bill doesn\u2019t provide EPA enough money to get through this enormous backlog of old, and in some cases, very dangerous chemicals to assess whether they need to be regulated or even banned,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will take EPA decades to get through the thousand most dangerous chemicals that EPA itself has said need urgent review.\u201d\n\nhttp://www.pbs.org/newshour/updates/it-could-take-centuries-for-epa-to-test-all-the-unregulated-chemicals-under-a-new-landmark-bill/\n\nWhen scientists study the toxicity of chemicals, they study the effects on animals of one chemical alone at a time. Very rarely do they study two or more chemicals and how they interact. Some chemical combinations can have multiplicative effects (\"synergistic toxicity\"). Here is one example:\n\n>[They show that some oestrogens such as ethinyloestradiol (one of the active ingredients of contraceptive pills) and organochlorine pesticides such as trans-nonachlor, although very weakly active on their own, have the ability to bind simultaneously to a receptor located in the cell nucleus, and to activate it synergistically.](https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2015-09/ind-lso090815.php)\n\nWe have no idea how these chemicals interact in our bodies, including the interactions between pesticides, pharmaceuticals, food additives, regulated chemicals, unregulated chemicals, and unknown chemicals.

    "body": "First and foremost, we have a fantastic art scene here. The cost of living is so ridiculously cheap, it makes engaging in any sort of creative endeavor substantially easier than other cities (even Detroit is getting gentrified in many neighborhoods that were once affordable) and there's an audience that's engaged and supportive of it here. Personally, I opened a food truck here three years ago, and we've been doing really well. I know I wouldn't have been able to make this business work in any other city with the level of ease I've had here. I bought my 1,800 sq ft, 4 BR house within a short walking distance of downtown for only $42,000; my monthly escrow payments are only $340, which is taxes/principle/insurance all in one. Water bill is high (which is still really messed up all things considered) but other utilities are manageable. My house would easily cost half a million dollars or more in other Michigan cities, let alone cities like Chicago, San Francisco, NYC, etc. \n\nOn top of it, since the cost of living is so affordable, I also have time to pursue other things like promoting punk shows and being involved with the DIY music scene in general (which also is super rad. If you know anything about punk, we've had bands like Black Flag, Fugazi, Slayer, Suicidal Tendencies, Suicide Machines, Superchunk, The Broadways, RVIVR, The Flatliners, Spraynard, and countless other super rad national/international bands play Flint over the years, the DIY community's kept the lights on downtown for decades when everyone else bailed). I even organize a weekend long annual punk rock festival that's [happening this weekend](http://www.vehiclecityfest.com), with 80+ bands from all over North America.\n\nI also started an urban farm with my partner in the lot next door, which I bought from the city for only $65 (it's about 1-2 acres of total land), which we plan on using for pop-up dinners, extra income, and food stability in our own home. I definitely couldn't do any of these other projects if I lived anywhere else, there would just be no way I could afford to do it since I would have to work so much more just to pay our bills.\n\nIn addition, we have all sorts of awesome and dedicated people doing REALLY rad things here. From tiny restaurants making innovative food, countless urban gardens and farms, to one of the best farmers' markets in the country, a world-class cultural center consisting of a fantastic theatre, planetarium, art museum, history museum, and more. Thursday night social bike rides/slow rolls, Second Friday Downtown Art Walks, and loads of other incredible events like the Flint Art Fair, Back to the Bricks (a huge car rally that draws 100,000+ people every year and all sorts of interesting/unique/classic automobiles), the Crim Festival of Races (world class 10k Marathon and more), and seriously so many other assets in our community. \n\nIt's SO frustrating that the national media only focuses on our challenges and rarely on our assets. I love living here and honestly see so much hope for the future, despite the water crisis. In some cases, I feel like it's actually helped draw more resources here to help deal with the issue. People want to help, and I think in the long term, the water crisis may ironically be a catalyst for positive change in our community and other communities around the U.S.",

Then after a little while when you need to pee, you go up to the bartender and say, \"Hey, you see that empty glass sitting at the other end of the bar there? I'll bet you $300 that I can piss from here, all across the bar and into that glass, and I wont spill a single drop.\" And if he doesnt take the bet at first, double it. He will accept though cause it's a shitty bar and you look piss drunk, so it should be easy money for him.\n\nWhen he agrees, that's when you whip out your dick and start pissing. _And you get your piss **everywhere**_; you piss on the bar, you piss on the floor, you piss on the phone, on the stools, and you piss _all over the bartender_.  You get piss fucking everywhere. And this whole time the bartender will be laughing his ass off hysterically. When he gets a breath he'll probably shout, \"You fucking idiot! Haha you got piss everywhere _except_ in the glass!!\".\n\nAt which point you walk toward the back of the room past a couple of patrons who watched the whole ordeal, and then you walk back up to the bartender with a smile and his $300 in your hands. And when you hand him the cash  he might ask, \"What the fuck are you so happy about? _You just lost $300!_\". At which point you say to him, \"You see those two guys near the back of the bar? Well I just bet them $500 _a piece_ that I could walk _right up to you_, and piss all over your bar, piss on your floor, piss on your phone, and piss _on **you**_, and not only would you _not_ be mad about it;  you'd be **_happy_**.\"\n\n\nI've yet to try it myself, but my good [friend](https://youtu.be/moAZ3AsyhLU) has tried it to varying degrees of \"success\".

    "body": ">What makes it so logical or fair? The fact that it extracts a similar amount of pain for people from different backgrounds? By that logic, should jail sentences be shorter for rich people since they lose out on more comparatively?\n\nEqual amounts of pain, if you want to call it that. I explained it further below, but basically paying $X isn't equal if one offender makes 3x and the other makes 10x. The dollar amount is the same, but the punishment favors the 10x'er. Time is finite; it effects everyone (almost) equally - dollars are essentially infinite or very insignificant for some.\n\n>I guess my point is that I don't think it's obviously true that punishment should be meant to extract equal levels of pain. It seems just as logical that a fine might take into account the risk of the action, or some other metric.\n\nPunishment for a crime is to be equal for all who commit it. Take $5 from me and 'damn I guess I'll eat at home' - take $5 from a homeless person and 'shucks, looks like I won't eat'. Take away my license and I lose my job (because no public trans and can't work smelling like I walked 10mi) - take away the license of someone who makes 10x me and they can hire an uber/taxi/driver for the next few years as needed.\n\n>I agree something feels off about fines not meaning anything for rich people, but I don't know if bigger fines for them is the solution. Maybe something like community service would be a more equitable punishment. Although that could pose issues for poor people who can't get time off work.\n\nSomething feels off because there's something wrong when being convicted of X could be a life altering financial crisis for some and just dumping of relative pocket change for others.\n\nE: added ; idk grammar",
