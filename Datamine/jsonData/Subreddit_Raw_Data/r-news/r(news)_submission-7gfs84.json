On top of that, they will charge you a special fee for using a refrigerator, or a stove, or a dryer. You can buy appliance packages to reduce those costs, but there will be no basic household appliances package - no, fridges will be priced in with air compressors, stoves will be priced in with pool pumps, and dryers will be priced in with hair dryers, quite fittingly.

    "body": "You boys want a good ole' Comcast story? \n\n\nMy mom has been a Comcast customer for 30 years. You read that right. THIRTY years. I have tried year after year to get her to switch to someone else, but she figures she has been with them so long and she's doesn't want to go through the effort switching, and the only other option is AT&T anyway. \n\n\nSo last Thursday on Thanksgiving the power goes out, surges the whole neighborhood and everything within 3 or 4 miles around our house. It's out for a couple hours. Bummer since it's Thanksgiving but not the end of the world. Power comes back on, but the cable doesn't work as the box can't seem to get a signal. The issue wasn't the fact that it wasn't working. The issue was how my mom was treated over the phone with Comcast support. \n\n\nMind you, this is a THIRTY YEAR customer -- do the math on how much she has paid over the years. She gets on the phone with support about the box not working, and the lady explains that my mom's issue is her power being out, not the cable, and that my mom needs to hire an electrician. The issue though is that the power has been back on for a couple hours now, and my mom is even using her landline phone to call support. She explains that the power is back on and has been for a couple of hours but the cable box still isn't working. \n\n\nThe lady then goes on to try to convince my mom that only her house's power went out, and no one else's (how would she know anyway?), and that, again, she needs to hire an electrician. I'm literally listening to this lady try to convince my mom that no one else's power went out except for hers. My mom is relentless so the lady finally agreed she would send someone out on Friday. \n\n\nGuy shows up the next day and spends literally half the day (felt bad for the guy) trying to fix the cable. No go. Finally he goes to my mom and says that she has a bad cable line and that, surprise surprise, she needs to hire an electrician to fix it. We're talking hundreds of dollars, if not thousands, to replace this cable line. \n\n\nMy mom is so aggravated that after the guy leaves, she calls support again. This time the person lets her know that since the problem wasn't with their service but is with her wiring that an electrician needs to fix, that she will be needing to pay for the Comcast service guy coming out and spending half a day with her. Unbelievable. \n\n\nIronically, my sister was messing around with the box that night and saw in the settings that there was an upgrade option that needed to go through. Clicked that and amazingly the box worked instantly. 2 minute fix to a problem the tech spent all day on. \n\n\nMy mom called back and I have never seen her so irate at another person in my life. Basically accused them of sending someone out who didn't know what he was doing and also pointing out that they tried, multiple times, to try and dump her off and then even billed her for the guy's time. \n\n\nFortunately she got the bill waived, and in good faith, the customer representative offered to send out one of their own contractors on Saturday, the next day, to check the cable line for free. The only requirement would be that she needed to be at the house from 8AM to 8PM. My mom is an empty nester and all the family is in town, so obviously she wanted to spend time with everyone but instead had to house sit (which we were happy to hang out with her). \n\n\nNow the kicker. The service guy never showed, so my mom waited all day for no reason. ",

For legal reasons, both need to cooperate very well, exchanging information, from warranted spying to bulk data collection, to looking for words that 'flag' emails and searches. ISP's need government support, and the government needs ISP's to maintain online internet dominance globally and locally. \n\nUp until this point, there has been no legal means to censor the internet. Websites that have terrorist activity, or activity that is not in line with the _state's objectives_ need to be censored. Part of that global dominance from a military perspective is not only piracy and ddos attacks on anti-state websites, but censorship.\n\nRegardless of what America wants, it's part of National Security to find means and ways to legally censor the internet. Suddenly, the fact that Black men were injected with syphallus in the 60's suddenly vanishes. The fact that Reagan sold crack cocaine to fund the Contras and buy weapons, vanishes. Terrorist websites also take forever to load. \n\nThis is the next step that must happen. Otherwise, the FISA court will do what it did to Yahoo: set up a million dollar a day fine until it complies with the NSA directive: military dominance over the internet.\n\nI am not sure if anyone realized but when Egypt toppled over a Facebook video, suddenly every government stood up globally and took notice of the power of Facebook. The power of sharing video and information. Suddenly, the internet became something that could create massive problems for sitting governments. A kill switch had to be installed. Censorship had to be installed. A way and means to force ISP's to do the government's bidding had to be coming.\n\nThis repeal does all of those things. \n\nSuddenly, access to websites that don't support the state will take a very long time to access. The Pirate Bay will be inaccessible. Chinese servers will be inaccessible. Muslim websites will be inaccessible. They will just take hours to load, or not load at all. \n\nLooking for data that Climate change is real? It might take an hour to load, if not more. Looking for data that the Dakota Pipeline leak caused massive environmental damage might take longer than normal. Netflix might take a little longer to get your videos, and your price will go up, as Comcast will now be in the Netflix Business. \n\nThis on the surface is about fast lanes. Underneath, it's about censorship, and enemies of the state. Because of that, it's doubtful your opinion matters to those in power.",

I sat in a meeting with upper management staff in a meeting about broadband modem cloning back in 2001. I actually brought it to the attention of top dogs from the area. They sat me down with other department heads and I explained the threat and even demonstrated it. Their first suggestion (from the Chief headend operator)? Block all websites - with this domain in particular-\n instructions on how to clone a modem via filtering software. Looking back 15 years ago, he said that a little too quick. Almost like, well we will just add it to the list. \n\nTo his credit, the President of operations at that time shot the idea down pretty quick. If I recall correctly, he said \"We have to be very careful with that\". Now, back then when the internet was in its infancy and we had just acquired @Home, we just assumed that ISPs could do that. I mean, why promote piracy and competition? Fuck that noise. We own the show we can do that.\nLong story short, Motorola patched a pretty big problem and it has fixed modem cloning. But Comcast being selective of what traffic is allowed to go through the network is no new thing. \n\nBONUS: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fc/Fiber_optic_tap.png/1200px-Fiber_optic_tap.png",

This has been going on MUUUUUCH longer than most people think.\n\nThe Telecoms have been in court battles against the FCC since the early 2000s AT LEAST. Prior to 2004 there was an FCC order that required ISPs and phone companies to sell access to their telephone switches and broadband nodes. That propped up the DSL market for a while until the order was vacated. Remember when DSL was competitive? Pepperige farm remembers.\n\nThen there was the 2005 order by the FCC that asked all the ISPs to play nice with internet traffic... until Comcast decided to throttle and block peer-to-peer filesharing protocols (and someone started blocking VOIP). The order worked to a point. However, was never really made law, so it didn't hold up when challenged in court.\n\nThen there was the 2010 Open Internet Order which actually enshrined network neutrality rules as official regulations... until it was vacated because the FCC didn't have the jurisdiction to do that under Title I of the 1934 Telecommunications act. IIRC, the judge who made the ruling actually just told the FCC to reclassify broadband ISPs under Title II.\n\nPrior to 2000, things get fuzzy for me. However, it's worth noting that several of the biggest ISPs are actually merged versions of the baby bell companies created by the 1984 breakup of AT&T (previously the Bell Telephone Company, A.K.A. \"Ma Bell\"). The history of THAT company is long and involves many abuses of monopoly powers to stifle competition. In fact, Bell was THE reason we wrote the 1934 Telecommunications Act. Bell was literally refusing to connect to competing telephone networks.\n\nAnyway, now we're thinking about rolling back Title II classification because politics. Apparently everyone thinks that regulations that were designed for the exact companies suing the FCC shouldn't apply... I just don't even anymore.",

    "body": "tldr: The FCC is about to kill net neutrality. We\u2019re protesting NATIONWIDE on Dec 7th to stop them. \n\nTLDR LINKS\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Marchfornetneutrality\n\nhttp://www.verizonprotests.com\n\nWHAT'S GOING ON? \n\nComcast, AT&T, Verizon and the National Cable & Telecommunications Association (NCTA) have\u00a0spent $572 million on attempts to influence the FCC and other government agencies since 2008\n\nImagine if you couldn't view comments critical of Comcast on Reddit, Facebook, or YouTube while using Comcast internet. Want to use Netflix and not Hulu, you're on Comcast so it will be half as fast as it is now.\n\nNet Neutrality is the basic idea that all Internet traffic should be treated equally. That means ISPs shouldn\u2019t be allowed to block content or charge extra for faster speeds. Current rules implemented in 2015 prohibit this behavior and subject ISPs to utility-style regulations under Title II of the Communications Act of 1934.\n\nThe Federal Communications Commission (FCC) just announced its plan to slash net neutrality rules, allowing ISPs like Verizon to block apps, slow websites, and charge fees to control what you see & do online. They vote December 14th. People from across the political spectrum are outraged, so we\u2019re planning to protest at Verizon retail stores across the country on December 7, one week before the vote and at the peak of the busy Holiday shopping season.\n\nWHAT YOU CAN DO! #1\n\nIf you live nearby or can make it to DC, GO TO THE MARCH FOR NET NEUTRALITY December 7th. More info at https://www.reddit.com/r/marchfornetneutrality\n\nWHAT YOU CAN DO! #2\n\nProtest in front of your local Verizon store. Go to http://www.verizonprotests.com/ for more info on the December 7th protests near you! Feet on the ground, show your support for net neutrality. \n\nWHAT YOU CAN DO! #3\n\nIf you're using Comcast, AT&T, or Verizon SWITCH YOUR CARRIER (if you can). Comment on their Twitter feeds, tell them why you're leaving, blow up social media. These companies have spent millions lobbying to influence the government and gain more control of what and how you use the internet. \n\nWHAT YOU CAN DO! #4\n\nPlaytime is over. Spread this message, talk with a friend, call your representative, do SOMETHING. If net neutrality is changed any actions now can help the appeal lawyers of the future. Don't sit on the sidelines, this is America, let your voice and opinion be expressed. Let others know how important this issue is. \n\nMORE INFORMATION \n\nWHAT\u2019S HAPPENING? The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) just announced its plan to slash net neutrality rules, allowing ISPs like Verizon to block apps, slow websites, and charge fees to control what you see & do online. They vote December 14th. People from across the political spectrum are outraged, so we\u2019re planning to protest at Verizon retail stores across the country on December 7, one week before the vote and at the peak of the busy Holiday shopping season. We'll demand that our members of Congress take action to stop Verizon's puppet FCC from killing net neutrality.\n\nWHAT\u2019S NET NEUTRALITY? Net neutrality is the basic principle that has made the Internet into what it is today. It prevents big Internet Service Providers (like Verizon) from charging extra fees, engaging in censorship, or controlling what we see and do on the web by throttling websites, apps, and online services.\n\nWHY VERIZON STORES? The new chairman of the FCC, Ajit Pai, is a former top lawyer for Verizon, and the company has been spending millions on lobbying and lawsuits to kill net neutrality so they can gauge us all for more money. By protesting at Verizon stores, we\u2019re shining light on the corruption and demanding that our local do something about it. Only Congress has the power to stop Verizon's puppet FCC, so at the protests we'll be calling and tweeting at legislators, and in cities where it's possible we'll march from Verizon stores to lawmakers offices.\n\nWHAT ARE OUR DEMANDS? Ajit Pai is clearly still working for Verizon, not the public. But he still has to answer to Congress. So we\u2019re calling on our lawmakers to do their job overseeing the FCC and speak out against Ajit Pai\u2019s plan to gut Title II net neutrality protections and give Verizon and other giant ISPs everything on their holiday wishlist. \n\nHOW CAN I JOIN? Click here http://www.verizonprotests.com/ and you\u2019ll find an interactive map where you can see if there is already a protest planned near you. If not, you can sign up to host one, and we\u2019ll send you materials to make it easy and help you recruit others in your area. These protests will be quick, fun, and 100% legal. If you can\u2019t attend a protest on December 7th, you can still help defend net neutrality by calling your lawmakers and spreading the word on social media. You can also sign up to host a meeting with your members of Congress, or volunteer for our texting team to help turn people out for these protests.\n\n-----------\nInternet service providers have a history of not playing nice or keeping their promises.\n\nISPs pocketed 200 billion when they promised to install fiber optic to every household. They didn't and kept the money. Http://reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/6c5e97/eli5_how_were_isps_able_to_pocket_the_200_billion/\n\nComcast quietly backs out on its promises for keeping net neutrality https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/7fwugt/comcast_quietly_drops_promise_not_to_charge_tolls?sort=confidence\n\nThese big ISPs are currently set up and not competing with each other's areas. They are oligopolies. They do this so they don't have competition. Some towns decided to try to provide internet to their respective towns, but are being legally slowed by these major ISP companies. Is your area supposed to get Google fiber but it still hasn't come yet? Same thing. These companies don't want competition so they are doing everything they can to make the process of competitors entering their territory as difficult as possible. \n\n\"OK but would these companies actually do what you're saying?\" \nAre you seriously going to trust these companies to NOT do everything they can to make a buck? Of course if they have the power they are going to use every sneaky tactic they can, and that includes ONLY showing you how great their service is on the internet when you use their service. Or what about if some other agency wants to come along and do the same? You could literally \"remove\" that scandalous picture from the internet if you bribe the ISPs enough. Some politician getting a bad rap? \n\nWhat if during the next election ISPs slowed down the website of the candidate they don't like to a crawl, and blocked websites being outraged at such an act. Then when the customer decides to switch carriers they don't have the option because there's only one service provider in their area. \n\nCurrently, legally they can't do that. In the future the option would be there. THAT'S why this discussion and net neutrality is so important.\n\nIf the ISPs were regulated like a utility (they should be) We wouldn't be having any of these issues. \n\nThe internet has provided some wonderful innovative and given the power of education and communication to the masses. Whatever your viewpoint is on a subject you can express it and find others who express the same. Repealing net neutrality is like going back on time, instead of seeing the information you want, your stuck with the information that's presented to you.\n\n\n\n\n          ",

You and many around you start making regular calls to Company X in California.\n\nEast Coast Telephone Company sees this, and goes to Company X to demand more money. Company X points out that they purchase phone access through California Telecom... NOT the East Coast Telephone Company. However, the East Coast Telephone Company persists. They say they'll block access if Company X doesn't pay up. Reluctantly, Company X strikes a deal with East Coast Telephone Company... but the story isn't over!\n\nNow East Coast Telephone Company goes to its users and cries about line usage. They want their users to pay more money for calls to Company X. Some people pay up, but most choose to use Company Y (which is quietly owned by the East Coast Telephone Company).\n\n---\n\nThis isn't a hypothetical. Most of this already happened during a one year gap in Network Neutrality regulations in 2014 and 2015.\n\nThe rules we applied to broadband companies were called the brightline rules, which are actually fairly simple. Basically, they ban Blocking, Throttling, and Paid Prioritization of legal content. They use the 1934 Telecommunications Act as their legal foundation, which is EXTREMELY fitting!\n\n\"Why is that fitting?\" I hear you ask. Remember that telephone analogy I used? That is the same kind of thing that was happening with ACTUAL telephone companies back in 1934. If you look up the history of the Bell Telephone Company, they were actively refusing to connect to competitors in order to stifle competition. Eventually the government \u2014 recognizing the value of a strong telecom infrastructure \u2014 stepped in to stop them. Bell has caused other problems as well, and has been broken up into smaller companies several times now. Most recently AT&T was broken up into the so-called \"baby bell\" companies in 1984.\n\nMany of the ISPs we have today can trace their heritage back to the original Bell Telephone company... who the 1934 Telecommunications act was originally written for.\n\nNow people are trying to claim that Title II is too strict and shouldn't apply to the internet. That's complete hogwash. The Title II regs were written for EXACTLY these situations.",

We've let city councilman and country chairs line their pockets with ISP money while we focus our attentions on the larger more flashy national elections.\n\n\nBut I think it's a matter of how much you, yourself, are willing to take from politicians you elect.  Sure Reddit is great at writing letter campaigns to congress members and to the president. That's a simple matter of going to some website putting in your zip code and getting an address.  But how often do redditors go to town council meetings and ask to speak?  How often do redditors write to their mayor or country chairs?  With their own words and not some prepared script that is easily dismissed as the work of bots?\n\nThese local non compete clauses are done at the local level.  It's not going to be solved at the national level, it's solved at the individual local city and county levels.  These elected officials have far less backing than at the national level and on avg. run unopposed.  What's interesting about going after local officials vs others at the national level, is rank and file national republican officials will start taking note if all of a sudden traditionally Pro-ISPs politicians start backing measures to end the cable companies cartels.\n\nI'm guilty of it myself.  Unfortunately, I'm out of the county at the moment but this has made me realize when I get back... in three or five months... that's one thing I intend to make a rather regular thing.  I want the local reps to not only hear me but remember my name in conversations.\n\nAnd old saying goes something like, \n\n> don't be the person who starts the day saying sarcastically, 'oh great... I'm up....what does the devil have in store for me today?' \n\n> instead be the person that the devil says \"ah shit! They're up?!

Subscribe to magazines and newspapers. It might not be the greenest solution, but it's the most reasonable way to take the power Comcast expects to get from this. Switch to a cheap flip phone. It may not be pleasant, but damn it things are going to get a lot more unpleasant if we don't stand up to oppression like this now. \n\nEven more, you can go out of your way to stop giving money to huge powerful corporations that are also going to benefit tremendously from this move. Stop buying from massive chains. Do everything you can to support small businesses because they are going to be fucked by this too. Even if you have to pay a little more, know that it's good for your community and for the country. I know not everyone has the luxury of just paying more for things they need, but if you can do it, you should. Also, find out what you can do to spread awareness about local elections and voting days. Recently I read a paper on how just the simple act of asking people to list when, how, and why they would vote makes them more likely to actually vote. There's a lot you can do locally. The scourge that the republican party is wreaking on the country started locally a decade ago. We have to start working locally to undermine it. ",

For competition to even be possible, a company would have to either place their own network or enter into some kind of agreement with Comcast or whoever to use theirs, defeating the purpose of the competition entirely. If it were treated like a utility, as it should be, the government would own and be responsible for the cables and sell them to local business to provide in-home access and upkeep. But since they're currently ISP property, they've got no feasible way to get them out of Verizon and friends' clutches. So they'd have to lay their own government cables nationwide and good lord, how much would *that* raise the deficit?\n\nI could be wrong about something in there, and I hope I am, but I feel like even if we do manage to keep net neutrality from being repealed, the utter absence of competition in the market of ISPs will take even more effort to solve.",

This would create a situation where you have competition over a neutral ground.  The problem is that we don't have a very functional government.  It should be as easy as a tax on internet usage that goes to continuing to maintain, expand, and upgrade the infrastructure.  However it's more likely that we'd end up with people trying to funnel the tax to other pet causes (or just schools/heartstrings so they can cut direct funding to those entities and use it elsewhere, the usual government shell game) or they'd be trying to cut the tax and not care that shit's broke, then try to get their cousin's second wife's son the contract to set up new lines all by himself for only a billion dollars a foot.\n\nStill, breaking up monopolies should be the goal, especially when it comes to the local resource monopolies ISPs have now.  I was originally against Net Neutrality because I felt this was the way to do things, and Net Neutrality gets the FCC's foot in the door.  The FCC controlling the net means censorship becomes a real possibility, and I don't want to have to fight that fight because it means I'd likely have to stand up for nazis, terrorists, and pedophiles again in the name of privacy and free speech.

Net Neutrality does not demand that every customer has an identical connection to the internet. \n\nNet neutrality only prohibits tiering of their customers connections to other services.

ISPs have been fighting explicitly for the ability to throttle specific kinds of content.\n\nThe major issue now, in a nutshell, is that Verizon successfully won a case that determined ISPs can't be held to Net Neutrality standards if the internet isn't treated as a common carrier (Title II). *That's* why it was a big deal when internet service was brought under Title II. The FCC's jurisdiction was essentially narrowed to exclude Net Neutrality, than clarified to both settle the issue and protect Net Neutrality. We went from a murky legal standing for Net Neutrality to clear regulation, and would be moving again into clear deregulation. There's a very good reason to be worried.\n\nThis also raises the question of *why* we should get rid of Net Neutrality at all. Even if we take your argument that the internet was fine before and will continue to be fine after, there's no basis to say it would be worth scrapping Net Neutrality. I've heard arguments about Net Neutrality stifling innovation and investment, but with little supporting evidence or argument.\n\nAs for cable television... I'm sorry, I don't understand your argument. You seem to be bringing up a bad example just to explain why it's a bad example. Maybe you were expecting me to bring it up, which is a fine thing to do in a debate, but the problem isn't behind the economic *reasoning* for cable or internet packages, but the fact that the *monetization* would follow the same structure.

I thought our constitution was built with a fail safe against these kind of corporate institutions. Just because corporations were designated as \"people\" doesn't change the fact that \"A lot of people\" are controlling a particular service in an area and hijacking the price... that still makes it a monopoly as far as Websters is concerned. And when it comes to Webster.. I don't mind that they are the final verdict on the English language. They do a good job at it and don't force people to pay for what the actual definitions of words really are.\n\nedit: To concur.

Using the same example, you can ask your relative what would happen if the person who owned the big corporate hardware store also owned the roads. Suddenly, every road that leads to other hardware stores, including the nice, local family-owned one, is bumpy and filled with pot holes and speed bumps and maybe not even paved, while the one that leads to the the (ISP) hardware store is well maintained. \n\nAnd get this, it already costs you money to drive on the roads. They're all toll roads. The money is supposed to help them maintain them, but now they have incentive to be pretty choosy about it. With internet, it's even worse, because they have to go out of their way to make this happen, rather than the natural way a road deteriorates. It's as if they had to spend money on people to shovel crap on the roads and dig up pot holes because the roads for the competing hardware stores aren't bad enough quality. Now you pay tolls out the ass, while the store owners are paying their competition / road owner to not shovel crap on their road. They're getting paid twice for no reason.\n\nOK, maybe the analogy is escaping me a bit, but I still think you can go on with it. Imagine, for example, that the owner decides to open other things: a restaurant, a clothing store, shoe store, a grocery store, etc. That town is going to get pretty shitty unless you take specific routes. The mom and pop stores aren't going to be able to build their own roads, so they're definitely fucked. They can have the local newspaper office ignore toll roads if they don't talk about this net neutrality thing, so no one knows why everything is fucked now. Just gets worse and worse. And then you tell your dad that's why you're protesting the Verizon store Dec 7th and hopefully he comes to join.",

In some cases, the telecoms pushed governments into paying to lay cable on the condition that anyone could use it, and won, and now, those same lobbying groups got those same governments to decide that since the telecoms are already using the cable, it's unfair to let Google Fiber use them, too. So Google would have to lay an entire redundant infrastructure down before even being able to start. So they said fine, they will. Then a tide of telecom money swept the local councils away, and they denied Google digging permits. They are not interested in competition.\n\nAnd, per comments on recent NN threads, I've seen that Comcast and the other giants have markedly different service in areas where there is still any competition. Data caps are not enforced, providing the unlimited service you pay for, and speeds are maintained. In areas where it's them or smoke signals, they'll cap you, screw you, overcharge you, do everything *to* you but nothing *for* you, because they can.\n\n**If repealing Net Neutrality were going to increase competition or improve the service you get or the price you pay, they would not want it.
