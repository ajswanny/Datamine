I'm grateful the Gates take interest and are proactive. Just adding perspective.\n\nTo add, L.A. school district's budget is 7.6 billion. Chicago is 5.5 billion.\n\nEdit: to clarify, the Gates Foundation isn't funding a school. This is an initiative to help push education research and methodologies while educating youth. Again, my numbers were just perspective. Another point, the federal cabinet level Department of Education's annual budget is around 70 billion.",

    "body": "Hopefully not a penny goes to my old high school.  They turned the beautiful library into a gym and cut art and music programs to build a massive football stadium. \n\nEdit*** ok wow I didn't expect this comment to explode!  I'm not saying I don't think a good athletics program isn't important folks, my problem is that it's going straight to the boy's football team and not much elsewhere.  \n\nA bit of backstory, in 2001 the school used tax money to build a multimillion dollar stadium, but they ALSO built that awesome library at the same time.  Fair enough, right?   Well I'm guessing that big stadium brought in enough money to do the big remodel that happened around 2011.   However, they cut a shit load of arts, music, language and drama programs while I was in high school between 2005 and 2009.  Then they go and turn that sick af library and computer lab into a fucking gym.  We already had 3 gyms, including a soft floor wrestling gym that was put in during that first remodel. \n\nSo here's the boy's football team getting bathed in money, yet the girls' teams and the less popular boy sports teams are out begging for money along the roads every weekend during their seasons as fundraisers.  It's not okay to lift up one tiny, tiny percentage of students but ignore the rest of the population.   They also cut a lot of AP science  and language programs too, that's not cool!  I had to go from French III to French V Honors because they cut languages and didn't have enough teachers for every level.  That sucked, I struggled keeping up with the more advanced students but I really wanted to learn French and I'd already devoted several years to it. \n\nJust because some kids might not be interested in science, languages or music, doesn't mean you should punish the ones who are.  We're all in school to learn and develop interests that will build us into adults, how can all kids do this if they're blocked from participating in things they're interested in?  ",

    "body": "I currently teach at a high school that received Gate's funding to be broken up into smaller schools.  It was CHAOS and we are still dealing with the effects.  \n\nMy school was broken up into three small schools located in the same building.  The idea was to give students smaller learning communities so they have more support.  Great idea in theory, but when you add in the legal requirements certain groups of students have (i.e. special education and ELL students) small schools do not have the capacity to address those needs AND provide a range of course selections and opportunities for students.  Also, the administrative overhead for each school was astronomically expensive and inefficient and not sustainable.  Naturally funding ran out, scores were not improving as desired, and they (Gates Foundation and school districts) dropped the initiative. However, once you break up a school into different schools, re-merging the schools back together is not as simple as it seems. It is a messy process where the students generally bear the brunt of the harm. \n\nI am glad that the new funding will be given with the expectation that those within the school and school district will mandate the changes.  Hopefully that will actually help solve some of the very real problems on the ground.  This will be a departure from reforms that make a bunch of changes that sound good in a press release, but actually screw over students or are ineffective.  ",

Basically, if you have an ungodly amount of wealth, you have two choices. Either the government is going to take half of it when you die, or you can create a charitable foundation and direct it to good projects and shape the world with it. You can't just pass it all to your (already super rich) kids and create a dynasty.\n\nOne such notable situation is Carnegie, who from his insane amount of money in the early 20th century founded the\u00a0Carnegie Endowment for International Peace,\u00a0Carnegie Institution for Science,\u00a0Carnegie Trust for the Universities of Scotland,\u00a0Carnegie Hero Fund,\u00a0Carnegie Mellon University\u00a0and the\u00a0Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh, among others. He had a profound impact on education and iirc many many schools here in the US were built through those programs.\n\nNow, I am 100% not saying that B&M, or even Carnegie, might not do this without that tax. B&M seem like truly genuinely good people.

From reading that report, your first response should be \"why\" and your second response should be \"how do we fix it?\" Only after those two questions are answered should you start drawing any conclusions. That's what this report is intended for.\n\n[If you dig into that report and their sourced data](http://www.keepeek.com/Digital-Asset-Management/oecd/education/education-at-a-glance-2014_eag-2014-en#page7), a few things quickly become obvious. First and foremost, our average is brought way up by the schools that do well. Our **good** schools get massive funding. On the whole, states like New Jersey and Massachusetts, according to that report, spend a huge amount of money on their schools. And *their* students do quite well. \n\nWe're talking way past the point where diminishing returns kicks in a significant rate. I grew up in rural Alabama. We had a couple computers in the library and one in the main office. On a inter-school visit, we went to a school just north of Birmingham where every student in every classroom had a computer, and they had whole storerooms dedicated to outdated computers and electronic equipment. They had tablets, they had white board systems that made our incandescent light bulb and see through paper projector systems seem shameful, they had the place decked out in some of the fanciest decor and building materials I've seen still to this day. And I was there for a *math* competition, so it's not like my school was the bottom of the barrel.\n\nMeanwhile, other states do every thing they can to rip funding from schools, and those do quite horribly. A Massachusetts school of 1000 may spend ten Mississippi school's of 1000 worth of funding, to produce good results. So you've 1000 students from MA averaged in with 1000 students from MS, and the result is that despite all that spending, half the students do terribly because only half the students see that money.\n\nAnd second, both actually and in this average sense again, this does not attempt to capture what an individual school spends that money on (again, because that's not the point of the report). First on that list: security. Finnish schools don't have the same security concerns than the Baltimore or Cleveland school system does. Not only is a rich school district going to spend so very much money on actual things with actual instructional benifit, but it's also not going to have to waste money on a twelve man security team and a few dozen metal detectors that the state requires them to buy new every now and then. Which brings us to three:\n\nThe Leave No Child Behind Act (or as I called it as an dumb high schooler, the Leave Every Child Behind Act) and its successor, the Let the Red States Fail Students Act (I'm clearly so much more clever now). What's this 1.7 billion being used for? I guarantee you the B&MG foundation is not so dumb that they won't spend some of that money working to get rid of nonsense, Republican-style legislation out of the way (and the older, democratic-style, old guard dick sucking laws too). They understands quite well how rich people make laws that siphon tax payer money to rich people, and there's no chance this 1.7 billion isn't going to that at least partially, even if it's just as a way to allow a school to deal with that draconian shit-show of a law. Hell, given that 1.7 isn't much on the grand scale, they're either going to work on specific places with pilot programs/proving grounds, or dedicate it to legislative reform. \n\nBut the point is, there's still so much potential for success by throwing money at this problem. We just have to learn to aim. \"Somehow,\" it keeps ending up in the pockets of the super rich.",

Myself and the 2 aids end up spending the most time with the special ed kids than working with the higher performing students. This is high school and those 13 kids will not go to college but we lie and pretend they will.\n\nI think something that would help a lot is trade schools for students that don't want, or are not capable of going to college. This would be a choice for the students and parents, but it's unrealistic to think these barely literate special ed kids that are integrated into normal classes are going to stand a chance at the college level. Right now with support from multiple special ed teachers, aids, extra teacher attention and individualized education programs, they still can't preform, so why do we expect they will be okay in college where they will get none of those things?\n",

Critical evaluation is an important skill to develop, but sometimes there isn't much to write about a detail beyond a single sentence of  \"the author sets the tone and scene of a critical moment in the protagonist's character growth by using blue curtains\". Hence we all used to complain about having to add in more bs to our high school writing assignments.\n\nAdding in a few lessons towards the end of senior year for resume optimization, cover letter practice, professional email/writing standards, and bullet point concise descriptions (like practicing for manager's logs or craigslist rent postings) are all valuable ways to promote effective writing. It would be developing those skills in a more relatable, practical setting.\n",

Building a foundation of these skills will allow someone to have the skills to learn about anything else like computers down the road.

There is nothing a district can do if an OOD placement is recommended on an IEP, the district must place the student there and must pay whatever the tuition happens to be...\n\nSo your tax dollars are being eaten away by ridiculous Health Insurance costs and SPED mandates.

I'm a parent in a high needs urban school district, one that, a few years ago, was almost taken over by the state because the school was terrible.\n\nThe district did the research to find out what they needed to change and how, and then started implementing those changes.  Lots of teacher training days.  Free breakfast and lunch for all kids regardless of income level, so that they're not too hungry to learn.  Community based social programs that target the families whose kids are chronically absent, so they can help those families get their kids to school.  Training the teachers to teach the kids CBT techniques to help them cope with shitty home lives and be willing to put the effort in to learn.\n\nPartnering with the local colleges to bring in new technology and educational opportunities for both sets of students is another example.  And it's working too; in the last few years, the high school went from one of the worst in the state to beating the state's average graduation rate.  It's not the best, but it's getting better every year.\n\nAll of that takes money.  My district applied for as many grants and special programs as they could, got extra money from the state because of their failing status, and raised school taxes.\n\nBut it's working.  And even if I didn't have a kid in the district, I'd still be happy to pay the school taxes.

Then there is just the overall bloated administration and ridiculous regulatory overhead. Finally, we have the cultural problem. Parents just don't care.

YOu have a lot of special interests who don't want things to change, and we know how well politicians work against donors. And of course the schools themselves don't want to fire staff... But not only that, schools look at teacher salary as an expense to be reduced. They want to pay as little as possible, flooding in the schools with the type of talent willing to work in a shitty environment for low pay. Schools need leaders, and adults who know how to teach and take charge, but those type of people aren't going to do it for 80 bucks a day. But how do you legislate paying teachers more instead of buying new vending machines, football fields, and so on? Schools never try to figure out how to pay teachers more money. \n\nSo much is already \"this is how it is and we don't want to change it\". You will have a hard time mandating the school needs to increase their budget for teachers, healthy full meals, and increase leasure time like time between classes and longer lunches, when the administration sees these as just cost increases that could be used for a new building or set of bleachers.

    "body": "Sure. \n\nIt's no secret how far below grade level the average student is. This wouldn't happen if students were held accountable. But the problem there is that there is only one method currently in place to hold students accountable: failure. One issue with using failure as an accountability method (much less the only one) is that it's so high-stakes that teachers and administrators are hesitant to use it since it would mean that student has to repeat a whole grade level. A much better system would break up content into hundreds of different skills that have to be mastered at a student's own pace. We don't fail the kid, we just work on a given concept until they get it. That means any given test is low-stakes. You didn't pass? No problem! We'll just work on it a few more days until you get it. Then we'll move on. Every kid moves along at their own pace and is held accountable for doing so simply be not letting them have access to the next level. \n \nThe K-12 model is laughably out of date. We divide students into 13 different ability levels and we base it off of age. Think about that for a second. Say an 8 year-old shows up to school. We have to decide what to teach her. Instead of figuring out what she knows and doesn't know, we just put her in there with the rest of the 8 year-olds. \"Oh you can read at a 6th grade level? Into 2nd grade with you. Oh you still can't sound out your letters? Into 2nd grade with you.\" \n\nI want to be clear that I don't advocate failure. I just advocate treating students as individuals with different needs. Instead we treat them with a 12-sizes-fits-all shirt. This has some serious unintended consequences. Number one, students who are ahead of their grade get bored and cause problems. Kids who are behind get further behind since they can't keep up and then cause problems. This is problem number 1 when it comes to behavior problems in schools, which are pervasive. The system itself, and not parents or poverty, is the most responsible factor in this. \n\nAlso, the cells-and-bells schedule, in which all students receive the same amount of instructional time per subject is another huge problem. Students that need an hour and a half to learn a concept get an hour. Students that need thirty minutes get an hour. It's ludicrous.\n\nThere are schools that are trying to counter this, such as the Delphian School in Oregon, which has students manage their own time. They give students (through online postings) the necessary concepts that they are required to master in any given period of time. Assignments, projects, and other proofs-of-mastery are posted and the students can choose when to work on which concept, and whether or not they work on it alone, in peer groups, or with a teacher. \n\nSo when I say 'students aren't held accountable,' I'm not parroting some idiotic conservative talking point about failing kids or bringing back corporal punishment. I'm referring to the out-of-date structure of the schemata under which education operates, which almost completely ignores individual needs and discourages accountability because it's too high-stakes.\n\nSorry for the thesis. Hope it was helpful!",

But when you see pathetically bad public school districts spending more money per pupil than the tuition at a good private school, or more per pupil than a great European system, it really suggests that more money isn\u2019t going to do much until underlying issues are fixed.\n\nThe fact that education spending has gone way, way up far in excess of inflation just to maintain but not improve the overall quality of the American school system is a real disaster, not just for the kids, but for the people paying into the systems and for America as a whole.",

    "body": "Single parents shouldn't feel attacked, they should feel validated. Raising children and running a household are some of the most stressful and time consuming tasks a person can undertake. Sometimes people end up single parents and they should never feel ashamed for it. The answer isn't to say \"well, you should have thought of that before you had a kid!\" but to say \"Sir/Ma'am, please sit down and sharpen the saw while we subsidize your household efforts a little bit!\". Children should not be a punishment and entire family's shouldn't just be swept away as \"Lost causes\". \n\nBecause even though I have no children of my own, it is in MY best interest that every child in my neighborhood is fed, read to, healthfully challenged, learning a second language, exercising, and educated. \n\nI used to live in a very poor neighborhood until recently. I was taking college classes and trying to save money. My neighbors were TERRIBLE people. Their children would run around all day like animals, crawling over cars, getting into fights, chasing cats, and screaming. Never once did I see a single toy, no dolls or action figures. Not a basketball or book in hand. And I often thought about buying something, anything, to enrich their lives and occupy their time. But I didn't want to be some weird white girl who hung around their kids too much and thought I knew anything about how to raise someone else's kids, so I just kept to myself. I know in my heart though that if those parents were given just the smallest amount of dignity and support, a lot of good could  have been done in that neighborhood.\n\nNow I live in a neighborhood with a nightly Book-mobile that comes around. Several of my neighbors have small lending libraries next to their mailbox. There are bike lanes, parks, and a well-funded community center. Those kids were given an unbelievable start in life compared to ONE area code over. The cycle of poverty and broken homes is vicious and hard for individuals to escape. Communities need to step in and lift up our fellow men.",

The reason we are in a position that we can't even address education spending at the federal level because we're focusing on defending stuff like healthcare for tens of millions of people, is a result of poor education. As long as this country is in an educational decline, like we have been for decades, we will continue to churn out uneducated people who lack the critical thinking necessary to elect people in not only their own self interest, but everyone's self interest. The more uneducated and under-educated people we have, the more people that will be elected to take advantage of them. The more of those people who are elected, the more time we have to spend time in Congress fighting to simply defend what we have, taking away from any possibility to improve the situation with education, equality and all of the contributing factors to the situation we are in.\n\nGiving a boost to education from investments such as these can help to start reversing the downward trend that led us to where we are now. Correcting this situation won't happen overnight, but if we do nothing but fight for what we still have, to keep that from being taken away, and never get to actually fight for what we deserve, then we'll never reverse the decline. It's stuff like this that makes that possible, because it undercuts what the elected officials are doing to undermine the population.",

So like, a town of 20 poor people can scrounge together to get the funds for a library (taxes), but thats inefficient for a number of reasons. But if you made the 20 people marginally poorer and all the money went to 1 super rich guy, the rich guy can very easily just buy a public library. \n\nAnd a number of uber rich guys like him were super philanthropic and gave back to society like crazy. The problem is, in reality if you have just one rich asshole who *doesn't* it all falls apart. Also, the rich would occasionally have to donate to causes they don't fine appealing, because society needs it.

She's a good teacher she had more than a year contract initially but she took time off for cancer and the rules changed before she came back. She likes teaching math, you would think it would be assured that someone with a master's degree and that can teach math would have a job and not have to worry about it every year.  Especially since the district has a shortage of math teachers.  \n\nLast year she had to apply for other positions within the district because they wanted her to teach science where she had been teaching math.  Why not let her keep teaching math you ask? The school got a new principal, the decision was arbitrary, she hadn't just been teaching math she had chaired the math program at that school for four years, what kind of idiot takes the math chair and says well you're certified to teach science so teach science.

Being in the military seems like it's the last job where you can get a high school diploma and then get a comfortable wage with good job security. I was getting a $45k salary + health insurance and 30 vacation days a year. You also sort of had unlimited sick days, though you generally had to go to the doctor who would be the one to determine if you would be off and for how long. The pay system means that some people with a certain set of skills could make *more* if they become a contractor, but people in the military get a comfortable wage. \n\nIf someone is flat ass broke while they're in the military, it means they're complete shit with money and would be broke at any wage.
