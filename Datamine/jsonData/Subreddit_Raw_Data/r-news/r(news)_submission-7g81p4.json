The gaming community has been slapping these jackasses for the last couple of years and each year they come back with some new, money grubbing, exploitive way to milk you out of your cash. They deserve to lose this much ground, but EA won't learn a single thing from this experience. Let this paint a picture for everyone. EA is so fucking greedy that they put a spotlight on the micro-transactions for all game developers, some of which have been getting away with some seriously sketchy shit for a long time. The gravy train is about to end.\n\nStay away from anthem, you know these slimy assholes are going to try the exact same. Pay-to-win grindfest that they did with battlefront.\n\nEdit: Well shit, this took right off.\n\nI know EA is still turning a profit. It's good they got a black eye with BF2, but until they lose money i don't think they will change their tactics at all. Losing 3 billion in stock is not the same as losing 3 billion in cash. Also, let's not forget about their abusive monetization in Fifa 18. They have made their money off of that system and continue to despite what happened to battlefront.\n\nEdit 2: Thank you for the gold, kind stranger!\n\n",

    "body": "To be honest, if I download a free mobile game, I expect microtransactions of some kind, and Fallout Shelter is my favorite example because although you don't \"need\" to buy anything in-game the way most freemium games are optimized for, people were willing to shell out money to enhance their own experiences while players who couldn't afford to do so weren't put at a clear disadvantage.\n\nLess forgivable are the things like the mobile SimCity games, which practically advance based on the practice, and that's why I never downloaded them. \n\nIf you expect me to pay money upfront and then shell out more for basic content, you're a piece of shit and I won't buy from your company until the practice stops (with EA, that means never). DLC/expansions (which are becoming increasingly interchangeable), that's fine, as long as it's clear it was more of a fleshed-out afterthought and not some basic game content the devs, marketers, et al. realized they could make an easy buck off of. You don't go into an Elder Scrolls game and expect the mq to be finished in the DLC, you buy the DLC because you were so impressed with what you got that you yearn for more, and while modders can cover a good extent of what the devs could, what they sell post-release is usually of the best quality, failing things like a good chunk of the non-essential DLC that often ends up lumped in with the GOTY editions. If you buy a Star Wars combat game, you expect a decent single-player experience, and even if your favorite characters are little more than a glorified power-up a la PS2 Battlefront II, you still get your money's worth. Paying $60+ on a game like the latest Battlefront II, you expect to get an experience that is at least on par with what we got ten fucking years ago, only to find that the best content is either pay-to-unlock or unlocked by grinding for an insane amount of time isn't just scummy, it's fucking shameful.\n\nAdded to that, the disgraceful way in which highly-anticipated releases such as SimCity 2013, The Sims 4, etc. were handled is more than demonstrable evidence that EA doesn't give a flying cunt about the gamer's experience, so long as the product they release can make a profit. When SimCity 2013 sucked, they canned it and let Cities: Skylines rake in the profit they could have made. It won't be long before some other company tries to do the same with the Sims. Of course, those disasters still led us here.\n\nI honestly think the only way this will stop on EA's part (to say nothing of other companies with similar practices) is that if Disney were to take away their ability to make new Star Wars games, they may actually pay heed. Of course, Disney will likely look for a vender who can, shall we say, more responsibly handle microtransactions, but so long as they handle it in a way that makes both economic sense and does not essentially tell gamers that they are simply money fountains, I may be able  to live with that",

    "body": "The article is pretty misleading, its down only 2.87% since EA made the most downvoted comment on Reddit and the outrage started. \n\nThe 3 billion number is the MTD (month-to-date) change in market capitalization, with the large majority of that drop in market cap coming before any of this Internet rage over Battlefront II. It came after their Q2 earnings on Oct 30th revising their Q3 revenue projections (they revised their estimate to $2 billion for the quarter, compared to analysts\u2019 forecast of $2.06 billion) which was not at all related to microtransaction outrage in any way. Nevertheless even with that estimate revision, it would still be 13% higher than their FY2016 Q3 revenue.\n\nMajor companies see their market cap change by the billions on a monthly basis very commonly, without any outrage and simply from various external factors or normal market trends. Hell just today their stock increased 2.48%, and saw over $700 million being added to their market capitalization. \n\nHere is the cold hard reality:\n\n>EA's total digital net revenue for FY2017 was $2.87 billion, of which microtransactions accounted for $1.68 billion. Since the publisher has a massive array of microtransaction and live-service-powered games coming in FY2018, such as FIFA 18, Madden 18, NBA LIVE 18, and NHL 18, the company expects its digital net revenues to increase by 14.63% to $3.29 billion.\n\nCurrently EA has 20 of the 27 analysts covering it recommending a BUY position, 2 recommend an OVERWEIGHT position and 5 recommend a HOLD. The average FY target price is $127, giving it a nice cushion to grow from the current price of $109. \n\nMore importantly, **EA makes $800 million A YEAR in microtransactions just from FIFA alone**, with a profit margin on Ultimate Team of nearly 100% since it takes absolutely no effort to add more cards. This is a yearly microtransactions revenue stream from one single game, the equivalent to selling 14 million copies at full $60 retail price. That's the entire lifetime sales of the massively hyped Battefront 1 game. That's more than Witcher 3 sold, its more than some of the most legendary games sold over their entire product lifetime, even including discounted price sales. \n\nAnd that's every year..and growing by double digits CAGR. Think about that, think about how difficult it is to create a game that sells 14 million copies a year, and think about how easy it is to make a lootbox/cardpack system.\n\nMicrotransactions will generate over 3 TIMES more revenue for game companies than actual game purchases in 2017:\n\n>Gamers will spend a whopping $22 billion on microtransactions in free-to-play games this year, double the figure from 2012 and nearly three times the revenue generated from full game purchases on PC and consoles combined\n\nhttp://www.pcgamer.com/revenue-from-pc-free-to-play-microtransactions-has-doubled-since-2012/\n\nEA isn't going to let this gravy train go anytime soon, nor are they particularly hurting. The full price purchase revenue will be dwarfed by the microtransactions revenue. Looking at EA's latest quarterly and FY earnings releases, digital downloads dwarf game purchases, and \"extra content\" (ie. microtransactions) dwarfs everything else in that category.\n\nThe unpopular fact is that Reddit outrage represents a tiny portion of the market, most gamers are casual gamers who have no issue paying for microtransactions. That's the sad reality. We haven't won anything, despite all the self-congradulatory celebrations over EA's demise and upvoting of every clickbait headline like this. \n",

Environmental Station Alpha, Axiom Verge, and Cave Story stand out too.\n\nIf you like puzzle games, The Witness, Obduction, and Fez are all good. I'm also a huge fan of Zachtronics' games like SpaceChem/Shenzhen IO/TIS-100 but those are pretty niche.\n\nTorchlight and Torchlight 2 were both a blast for diablo-esque dungeon crawling.\n\nBastion was an amazing action RPG.\n\nThere's lots of good 2D action platformers that can get pretty difficult, like Super Meat Boy and Dustforce.\n\nFrictional Games have some of the best horror games I've ever played (or been too scared to play). I don't think they technically count as indie but they're not AAA either.\n\nThere's tons of roguelikes, but FTL and Binding of Isaac especially come to mind. Darkest Dungeon isn't a roguelike but it's fun for similar reasons.\n\nIt's still early access, but Subnautica is a lot of fun warts and all. Unless you have thalassophobia, in which case it's a horror game.\n\nFor old school top-down action RPGs, Hyper Light Drifter and Cross Code are both great (note: cross code isn't officially out yet, it's in the last stages of early access).",

Both had beta persiods in which the game was very well received, players were clamoring for more, and only a few days after the game was released did the stock market take notice.\n\nIn particular with Pokemon go. The game wasnt even made by nintendo, it wasnt that great, but the sheer excitement for the game (more people wanted in on the beta than it could handle, and people anxiously waited for regional versions) indicated a *very strong market for pokemon products even before the release, which the market subsequently took note of.",

I'm sure there's stuff out there you can buy with only cryptos or only by sending nudes...    \nThe fact remains that all the big publishers and all the AAA titles are going to have more and more of that shit in their games because it's cheap to do any rakes in stupid profits.   \nYou can avoid those big name games all you like. That's the beauty of choice. I'm just saying that's where the industry is going and it's not going to stop until people stop paying for it.   \nIt's the same reason we get 8 Transformers movies and the same reason we get a new COD game every year.

It's easy in hindsight to say \"Oh I totally knew Pokemon Go was going to be huge\" but when you have to put money on predictions, it's a different thing. Plenty of hyped games don't turn out to be all they're hyped to be. \n\nOne of the first stocks I ever bought when I first got into the stock market was ATI - they had just released a graphics card with DirectX 9, which was a huge advance that everyone wanted, and NVidia wasn't expected to release one for six months. ATI's stock quadrupled over the next six months. It's the perfect example of something that institutional investors didn't see as very important, but the market did.\n\nI have never had a trade like that work out since then. ",

Just say \"hey, just make it free, it's totally okay otherwise.\"\n\nYou can't have it both ways.\n\nAlso, as an aside, sorry if it seems like I'm just going off on you here - definitely not the case!
