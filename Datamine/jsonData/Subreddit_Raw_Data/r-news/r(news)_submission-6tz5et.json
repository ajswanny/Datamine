See: Rules for Radicals by Saul Alinsky- its highly recommended to use.\n\n\n\nFor example, the \"Berniebros\"- Clinton supporters tried to label all Sanders supporters as sexist, which *of course* was why they refused to support her (which wasn't true at all). It was a distraction tactic that didn't get much play, but Sanders still had to defend himself against it. And it was certainly lobbed at Trump to try and get him on the defensive as well. Again, it didn't work as effectively as predicted, because many people, especially independents who supported sanders and were still reeling from their treatment by the establishment Democrats, saw through the bullshit, and even if there was evidence, it was a \"Boy Who Cried Wolf\" situation and perhaps people still voted for him out of spite  because of its initial use for someone who didn't deserve the label. \n\n\nAnd the tactic feeds into the present day- anyone who had criticisms of Obama's policies over the last 8 years usually had the race card thrown at them. When that's the primary card Democrats/liberals would use against their opposition, that has led in part to today's political climate.",

One perpetrator, Henry Hays, was sentenced to death and executed in 1997, while another, James Knowles, was sentenced to life in prison after pleading guilty and testifying against Hays. A third man was convicted as an accomplice, and a fourth indicted but he died before his case could be completed at trial.\n\n>The execution of Hays was the first in Alabama since 1913 for a white-on-black crime. It was the only execution of a KKK member during the 20th century for the murder of an African-American.[3]\u00a0Donald's mother brought a civil suit for\u00a0wrongful death\u00a0against the\u00a0United Klans of America\u00a0(UKA), to which the attackers belonged. In 1987 a jury awarded her damages of $7 million, which bankrupted the organization. This set a precedent for civil legal action for damages against other racist groups.\n\nFor those who didn't click the link.\n\n",

We call things \"domestic terrorism\" but legally speaking, there's no criminal charge to correlate. McVeigh wasn't charged with domestic terrorism, for instance. \n\nEdit, to clarify: NPR did a great piece on this, but the gist is this: \n\n- the laws passed regarding terrorism applied to foreign enemy combatants.\n\n- many said \"enemy combatants could mean citizens, slippery slope\", but it never did get that far reaching. Admittedly, I was one of them saying so. But that didn't happen. Other shit did. But not that.\n\n- The reason why that slippery slope was too be avoided, and why the government never went down it, is the same: you can't grant that distinction on a case by case basis. You have to be able to define it clearly in legal terms. They can't. \n\nNow, some might argue, \"terrorism is violence with political motives\". So is war. So are special ops. And drones. And arguably, anything a cop does. In this country laws still must apply equally. \"Politically motivated\" isn't a clear line. \n\nThe fact is, we can't write a domestic terrorism law that wouldn't violate constitutional rights left and right. SCOTUS has basically upheld that criminal violations must be based in action, not ideology. The first amendment still matters.\n\nSo we haven't made strict laws and statutes to convict a person of \"domestic terrorism\". Even if a state \"observes\" a group as a \"terrorist\", they're breaking no laws by just gathering as a group under similar ideology. Even the ACLU defends that. They need to act on something, commit an actual crime. Then they might bring up some charge (that the ACLU will fight and appeal). Ideology isn't a crime in America. That's the constitution.\n\nWe still call things domestic terrorism. PR still plays. But criminally, legally, it's not. That'd set a very, very big precedent. Frankly the thing about a republic is you never give them a power you wouldn't trust in the opposing side's hands. Because when elections come and tides change, the powers remain.  ",
