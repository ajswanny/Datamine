It would be extremely odd to rape her and then take her back to her friends or to the station.  It would also be incredibly stupid to just leave her there and assume she would keep quiet.

    "body": "Yo for any people who are like, \"well some evidence came out that she really didn't resist and that she in fact consented\", let me just say this: as a victim of rape i have 'consented' when I thought the outcomes would be worse. I.e. 'Should i just take it? Should i just pretend like i like it? Should i just give in'. And these thoughts (at least for me) were prompted by how after saying a vigorous no, they still were pushing me down. And no matter how much i said no, they said i obviously wanted it. Even to the point of getting me to shut up (i.e. Hitting me hard enough to try and pretend that I was into this all along, somehow). Note: from my own past experience, it's better to give in than to get your ass beat.\n\nFor those who may not quite get what it means to get your ass beat by a stranger of whom you have no idea how bad it will be, it's bad. I had bruises for more than a month after refusing. When it happened, i thought they had broken bones. But the human body is seemingly more resilient than you think. And at the time i didn't know if he would come to his senses and let me survive. So i pretended to be okay with the situation so i could survive. If this sounds insane to you, other people who have experienced the same thing may come out of the woodwork and surprise you",

So that's just shoddy journalism rather than being unclear about whether she's legally under age. 18 would apply if they took her across the state line I think, since that would make it interstate and apply the federal age? Not sure.\n\nBiggest issue is definitely the fact that they're uniformed cops on duty trying to claim sex with someone they handcuffed and dragged off was 'consensual.' Even *if* it was, that's actually still bribery as far as I know. That's like handcuffing someone, dragging them off, getting busted pulling cash out of their wallet then refusing to deny it happened and calling it a gift. Which would be a bribe (prohibited) from someone they arrested and is helpless so it also calls into question the validity of their claim that it's a lesser offense (accepting a bribe) than the obviously criminal act they got caught in the middle of.",

    "body": "This is exactly what happened to me. I was 19 years old at a party. A guy told me he knew a cool place we could go explore. I always like creepy stuff like abandoned buildings and whatnot, so of course I was down to go with him. He took me to this old trailer out in the woods and said something about how some people thought it was haunted or whatever. I knew this guy and everyone thought he was so nice. He had lots of friends, looked like a totally normal, handsome guy. I thought he was my friend. He said, \"after you\" and I stepped in first. I assumed he was just being a gentleman like he always was, so I went in before him. As soon as the door slammed behind him, I knew. I don't know why, but I just KNEW I was in danger. He wasted zero time. Shoved me, HARD to the ground and said, \"get down, bitch\". I tried to get back up but he said, \"I SAID GET DOWN\". It smelled like mold in there and there were long pine needles on every surface. I was considered a tough bitch in my circle of friends, and I used to be one of those people who was cold whenever I heard of a rape. \"Why the fuck didn't she fight back? I would've ripped that guy's balls off!\" But I can't explain the feeling of shock and terror, and the realization that this guy is infinitely stronger than you, is so angry and vicious for no reason, and not knowing if he just wants to rape you or torture you, kill you, or keep you held captive forever. So I did what I believe saved my life. I did what he wanted me to do. I didn't fight him, because I didn't want the violence to escalate. I pretended I liked it. As soon as he realized I wasn't going to fight him, it's like he relaxed and loosened the grip on my throat, stopped screaming at me, and apologized when he was done. He made me promise not to tell anyone. I had cuts and bruises on my back and thighs, and I had trouble sitting down for over a week. I didn't go to the police. No one would believe me. He had a lot of friends. People saw us leave together. I had been drinking. I am 30 now and am forever changed for what happened to me in that trailer. I am alive today because I did what I could to save my life. Please don't judge survivors for what they have to do to survive. We do the best we can at the time during the most horrific moment of our lives. I feel for this girl and I admire her courage to speak out. ",

Did you report any of them?\n\nEdit: One time my buddy was driving back home and his license plate light was out (the little light that lights up the digits on your plate -- it's required someplaces). He gets pulled over, they mention the light, he's like oh I didn't know, sorry, I'll get it fixed ASAP. They make him get out of the car, search him, search his whole care, and then make him fingerprint on the back/trunk of his car so they could put him in their network or whatever. Coulda been coincidence (like maybe the light started working again on the drive home), but he got home and his license plate light was fine.  I wasn't there but it sounded super super fucked up. Sounded like they were basically arresting him without arresting him.",

You can't possibly imagine that *all* police officers are shitty, it literally just doesn't make sense. The issue we are looking at is *statisical* in terms of whether or not the police are a force for good in general, or if they are acting badly. My example of a good cop? My girlfriends dad! He's a cop in Winnipeg and I can't imagine anyone better suited for the job. He's kind, caring, understanding, but can tackle you and arrest you if he needs to. He'd rather educate you than punish you. I'm sure many people can think of a police officer they adore, or for people in shittier areas (read: LA, Baltimore, Russia) cops they aren't implicitly afraid of. \n\nAnd, there are cops here in Canada that I distrust, because why the hell wouldn't there be? Cops are people. People suck. In fact, one of my highschool bullies was working towards becoming an RCMP officer, but when I found out I simply sent an email to the RCMP detailing the way he treated people in highschool, and if there was any indication that he had not changed much, he should be watched closely. They responded by telling me they appreciate the concern for public saftey. He never did get the job.\n\nSecond edit:\n\nListen guys, the dude **above** me is /u/PM_POT_AND_DICK_PICS, i'm /u/PM_ME_REACTJS.

They beat the crap out of Alex as revenge. I suppose this is sadly realistic, as we have to consider the types of people who would be attracted to policing as a job, considering that it is high risk in many cases and the things you see can be stressful, and it isn't the best paying career around, but affords you a lot of authority and respect in your community.

In 2008 our wonderful Supreme Court ruled 5-4 that executing a child rapist is \"cruel and unusual punishment\" if the victim did not die (capital punishment for rape of an adult had already been ruled unconstitutional).\n\nA key fact in the Supreme Court's ruling was that no federal jurisdiction imposed the death penalty for the rape of a child. Only one problem -- that wasn't true. Under the US Military justice system, rape of a child had been made punishable by death two years ago, but this country's nine highest authorities on the law totally missed that. See [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kennedy_v._Louisiana#Factual_error). And when called on their mistake, by a 7-2 decision the justices basically went, \"Oops, our bad. It really didn't mean anything to our decision even though we mentioned it. We refuse to go back and talk things over again.\"\n\nSo there you have it, thanks to a one-vote majority on a court that bungled basic legal research, kidnapping and raping a five-year old is punishable by, at most, free room and board for life. A ruling so absurd that even then-candidate [Barack Obama disagreed with it](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/26/washington/26scotus.html) in no uncertain terms. This means that putting handcuffs on and then raping a 17 year old has the same maximum punishment, although I'm sure we all know the odds of these police even seeing the inside of a prison cell, let alone spending life in one.",

He wasn't very bright, he was easily influenced, and he was kind of a shitty person (steal meaningless shit, lie, etc). \n\nEvery day, we'd hear about it. We all graduated and went to colllege, he went to some criminal justice program and got to do ride alongs, and get to know officers and what not.\n\nHe was more of friend of a friend status, but we spent a lot of time together as kids, and I even played peewee football with him. Well a few years later I hear, he didn't want to be a cop, and instead is doing some admin shit. So the next time I saw him, I asked him straight up, \"what the fuck? That's what you've wanted your whole life, what made you not want to be a cop?\"\n\n\"I got to know a lot of officers, and they were all alcoholics, and most of them are abusive in their personal relationships, that's just not how I want to live my life.\"\n\nI was floored. This was one of the dumbest, easily influenced and corruptable people I have ever known, telling me the officers he personally knew kept him from that career. I was also surprised by his ability to internally reflect, but that's a different story.\n\n\"Most of the \"good\" cops, we're still abusive alcoholics.\"\n\n\"They stalked and harassed people. They broke the law to make arrests.\"\n\nIt went on and on.\n\nI don't have a point, I just thought it was a relevant and interesti ng story about police culture.",
