    "body": "I think they are running out of ideas for the script because when they started this show, they didn't really think through how it would end. That's always a problem with these scripted dramas - they get so lost in the show-by-show narrative that they forget the larger story arc.\n\n\nReally, what the hell were they thinking with the whole \"president is actually a Nazi sympathizer\" thing when they wrote his own son-in-law character (and his daughter!) in as Jews? Sloppy! But still, it's TV worth watching, if only because of the audacity of the basic idea of the show and the incredibly complex scripting needed for a plot as wildly complex as this. \"Lost\" was a 3 act 70's sitcom compared to what I'm seeing here.\n\n\nI'm still glued to the TV just to see what happens next, but getting a little worried that they will \"jump the shark\" long before their first season ends.\n\n\nToday's episode (Bannon Gets Fired) is an example of the script gone sideways. It is a really weak plot twist and his eventual firing was always painfully obvious from the earliest episodes. His character was so poorly developed as the stereotypical \"evil villain\" that it never had a chance at any nuance. I am not surprised with today's episode. There wasn't much they could do with him. Fortunately, they have done a better job with the other dark-hats in the cast - Pence remains a terrifying zealot with undeniable charm - maybe we'll see him much more in future episodes, and of course, there's Scott Pruitt's hilarious character who borrows heavily from \"Ron Swanson\" in \"Parks and Recreation.\"\n\n\nIt's a shame that there are STILL no strong female characters in the cast, the show could use them. Betsy Devos is nothing more than a kind of darkly comical relief to the somewhat relentless main story line. The UN Ambassador character (\"Nikki\") might as well have been written out of the show, it's been so long since she's had much screen time.\n\n\nThe main thing is that with all of the twists and sub-plots and \"big reveals\" the writers may have painted themselves into a corner at this point and may need to have some fundamentally new story lines if the audience gets tired of the current one.\n\n\n\nOne that would be interesting is if the president character switched parties to Democratic because his own party \"was blocking his vision.\" Is it even possible for a President to do that? Who cares! In this show, it seems that they've just decided to let his character do whatever he wants. Remember that his backstory in the pilot miniseries even SAYS he was a democrat once, so maybe that could happen (and if you haven't seen \"The Campaign\" by all means, do take the time to binge on it, it's amazing).\n\n\nI am still wondering what happened with his current wife (was her name \"Melina\" or \"Ivanka?\" - just kidding!), she was really starting to develop into an interesting antagonist and that hand-slap scene coming off the plane was really well written and performed. Maybe SHE is the one peeing on him in the videos the Russians have? That would be awesome.\n\n\nAnother thing this show lacks so far, in comparison to shows like it (\"House of Cards\" or \"Apocalypse Now\") is some kind of \"rational person accidentally in this crazy situation\" character. Kelly could be that, but he's really not been in enough scenes to set that storyline up. Maybe the writers are holding back on that direction until after they kill of a few of the more prominent players to make a little room in the story.\n\n\nSTAY TUNED!\n\n(Edited for small typos) ",

I want them to talk about racism every day. If the left is focused on race and identity, and we go with economic nationalism, we can crush the Democrats.\u201d\n\nIn that sentence, I think he was essentially admitting that focusing on racial/identity platforms on the right or the left are a losing battle. Economics is a thing everybody cares about and focusing on that has always been the core of his strategy for that reason. I think the acceptance of the social side the right and alt right was indifferent to his heart and reluctant with respect to the point he made in the quote above. But it was a means to the end of the populist working class economic message that Bannon spoke about years before this election and was so confident would propel him to the top.\n\nHis work at Breitbart was essentially taking advantage of the above. He was providing the fuel that threw Democrats off course chasing the social message that he thought was less likely to win the election than the economic message. It seems that that blew up in their face as they're having trouble distancing themselves from it now and that's probably why he tried to reach out and point the focus back there and also possibly why he's now leaving the white house.",

Bannon received an ethics waiver that allows him to remain in contact with Breitbart staff, and it would seem pretty obvious that some conspiring must go on. No writer on earth would allow a colleague to decamp for a job in the White House without pestering the daylights out of him for leads and scoops; what\u2019s harder to explain is why so few of those leads and scoops turn up on Breitbart. When a White House leak does surface on the right, it\u2019s far more likely to appear in a competitor, like Shapiro\u2019s The Daily Wire or the blog of Mike Cernovich. Shapiro told me that he doesn\u2019t think Bannon gives much to Breitbart at all. \u2018\u2018The way Steve plays the game, it wouldn\u2019t make a lot of sense,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018If he\u2019s going after Jared Kushner, he\u2019s not going to do that through Breitbart, because it\u2019s too obvious.\u2019\u2019 Charlie Spiering has yet to land an interview with the president, and in early June, Alex traveled to Sicily for the G-7 meeting, hoping to interview Trump himself \u2014 but Trump declined to see him. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s starting to become a pattern,\u2019\u2019 Alex told me recently. \u2018\u2018They\u2019re keeping us out of reach.\u2019\u2019  ",

But in the US that's just a bare minimum standard expectation.  That's not a reason to cheer or just \"be happy.\"\n\nPeople voted for Trump because they weren't being heard for years and Trump appeared to hear them (though I'd arguing being heard isn't the same as being understood) and Democrats assumed that Trump's blatant ass-hattery wouldn't be attractive enough to even sniff the nomination, let alone an electoral college win.\n\nEven if Trump were gone tomorrow, that frustration in our political machine is still there.  Maybe some of them back off because of how bad Trump was and you go back to \"typical\" republican candidates, but if things don't change that fringe could come back and you don't necessarily know who it's going to be the next time.",

It's going full on nihilist/apathetic because the system is a lie and you can't game it either even when knowing the truth.\n\n\nObviously, you have to take context into account. Here's a good example: dating women as a straight man.\n\nThe Bluepill: women care more about your personality and you should treat them as your equal.\n\nThe Redpill: women care about your physical attractiveness, social status, resources and finally your nice personality. They also don't respect a man who sees them as equal. You play the system right by realising this and acting accordingly.\n\nThe Blackpill: you're a short, balding, skinny guy. You have no realistic chance with any average women no matter how much you improve your appearance, social status or personality. Even the least attractive women will reject you most of the time. You better stop wasting your time looking for intimacy and focus on your life and maybe use prostitutes if you want to get at all close to an attractive woman. \n\nEDIT: NOW DO YOU TAKE THE BLUEPILL OR THE REDPILL (which might just turn out to be a blackpill, hence why it's dangerous)!?? \ud83e\udd14    ",

(The incel community refers to themselves as having taken the blackpill, or \"taking the black\" which I assume is a Song of Ice and Fire/Night's Watch/celibacy reference, as well.) \n\nBut viewing each pill as only associated with the single context (romantic relationships, in this case), makes it difficult to understand that they're really ways of describing attitudes toward large social systems. \n\nYou can be blue-pilled about politics in general (\"all you have to do is show up and vote! it will work out!\"), criminal justice (\"just don't commit crimes, and the cops won't harass you!\"), or even working at a mega-corp (\"2 weeks vacation and a chance of a 3% raise! what a deal!\") - each of these has a red-pill counterpart that views the system cynically, but still as functional if the correct methods are used - and a black-pill counterpart that has devolved into utter contempt and/or apathy.

Extreme right wing or plain \"neocon\" funding companies like Sinclair Media or disingenuous fucks like \"Prager University\" (Whose ads can be seen in YOUTUBE MUSIC VIDEOS talking about \"the regressive left\" and things that are literal dog whistles for racism like 'race realism') who are either actual zealots or just minions of big oil and corporate interest. The third group could be independently rich people who veer towards right-wing views and/or a dogmatic hatred of anything \"liberal\" for no reason other than upbringing, but I'd bet a small sum of money they're starting to get a bit worried they pitched in on the wrong side this time, if not actually able to revoke any fascist or morally repugnant ideologies they hold in general. \n\n",
