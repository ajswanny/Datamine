    "body": "This article is misleading and poorly written. Nearly every court has long ruled you have the right to film the police if you can do so safely. \n\nHowever, there is a long held rule that if police arrest you for exercising a clearly established right, you can sue the officers personally and take their personal assets.  It prevents the police from arresting black people for sitting in front of the bus, and then letting the officer say \"my bad\" when you get released three days later. The officer has to reimburse you for your lost salary, legal fees, time and suffering. \n\nWhat the appeals court decided here was that the right was not clearly established at the time, but would be from now on, in their jurisdiction of Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas.\n\nMany of the other appeals courts have already ruled the right was clearly established when the case was brought to them. What made this case different was the fact that the guy wasn't filming a specific action, he just stood outside the police station and started filming, which would lead a reasonable officer to wonder if he was casing the joint.  There was nothing unreasonable about detaining him to ask what he was doing, get his name, etc, he shouldn't,  however, have been arrested. \n\nSo in order to let this officer off, they claimed the right was not clearly established at the time (a white lie) but would be from here on out. So from this point on, they can ask questions and get your ID, but they cannot arrest you merely for filming them. Had he been arrested for filming a specific interaction with the public, I'm sure the decision would have been unanimous that the right was clearly established. But this was an unusual case, the guy just did it to provoke the officers, who weren't quite sure what to do. What the court did here was to say there simply say that, no you can't be arrested for recording even under these circumstances, but they let the officers off with a little creative legal jockeying.

I suspect if you were filming a bust where undercover officers were involved as well as uniformed officers, the police would have the right to prevent you and confiscate your cameras if your video could harm an undercover officers ability to do their job in the future, or even expose them to potential harm.   There may also other scenarios that it could be argued filming the police may interfere with their ability to do their job, or infringe on other innocent civilian's right to privacy.   Privacy laws do not permit infringement where that may publicize the individual in a false light, so if you filmed an innocent transaction that led others to reasonably believe that individual was engaged in criminal activity, or posted the video with that inference, you could be violating the law. \n\nIn short, you should use common sense.  If its an ordinary police action, then I expect the police to not infringe on a person's first amendment right to film them.  Otherwise, just because you can doesn't always mean you may.\n",

Its difficult to fight audio and visual exclusion when youre in those highly stressed situations.\n\nBut in the same light, body cams can't catch everything (from the officers prospective). Shoulder mounted ones don't move when the officers head moves, and sometimes depth perception in video is hard to determine. \n\nDon't even get me started on the importance of them in some Domestic Violence cases. A lot of time the victim half will recant before or during court because they go back into the honeymoon phase of their abusive relationship. Cases where a man has severely beaten his wife and she will show up to court saying she lied initially and that he would never do that even though the body cam footage shows a bloody mess from the day it happened. Thats when you start to really love that footage. To stop that abuse. To help stop a kid from ever seeing his mother get the shit beaten out of her for messing up dinner.\n\nThe only real problem I have with the bodycams is the ability for people to armchair quarterback your decision for weeks, with no stress.

It's more or less a issue of the fundamentals of recording something somewhere and whether or not it's legal to do so. A good example of this was Massachusetts and upskirting. So long as you did not record audio it was perfectly legal to record up someone's skirt in public up until 3 or so years ago.

Her argument is that there is no Supreme Court or, before this case, 5th Circuit precedent directly saying that there is a First Amendment right to record the police.  Thus, since the right is not \"clearly established\" the police should be entitled to qualified immunity (QI protects police who get violate someone's constitutional right if the right is not \"clearly established\").  All three judges actually agreed with all of the above.  The other two judges, however, think it's time for the court to address the issue of whether the right to record the police exist.  The dissent prefers to not decide the issue.  The way the law on qualified immunity goes, whether to decide the issue or not is basically left up to the discretion of the court.",

Police overstep authority and issue commands under the threat of force. Their gun on their hip is that threat, in many states: civilians can't open-carry because it's seen as intimidating. Our legal system is also such that we can be held for no reason. That's more intimidation.\n\nI get that there's a difference between harassing and filming. Scientology harasses people with filming all the time. They get away with it. \n\nIt's just that the issue is relatively new and has been batted around the courts. It should be. And in my opinion, and apparently the courts' as well, documenting a public servant performing their job is a valid reason to film. If they want to work the public sector, they should be held liable to public scrutiny. ",

In 2012, the Boston Globe revealed that a prominent Jesuit and trustee at Boston College played a major role in covering up decades of abuse by a Jesuit priest from Chicago. In 2014, the Globe reported that a prominent American cleric named by Pope Francis to prosecute cases of priestly abuse was himself involved in the coverup of molestations. However, the days of transferring abusive priests to another parish to sweep problems under the rug are over.\n\nThe number of new credible allegations is one-third of what it was a decade ago. And with clergy sex abuse scandals now blowing up in other countries, the U.S. church is considered a global leader in prevention efforts.\n\nAs a Catholic myself, I believe members of the clergy who take advantage of their position of authority to victimize the most innocent members of the church have a special place in hell.

Texas](https://www.oyez.org/cases/2012/12-246), for those curious.\n\nI think the Salinas decision turned on the fact that the defendant voluntarily answered questions, without being placed in custody, for *an hour* before finally buttoning his lip. The prosecution was then allowed to use that as evidence of guilt at trial. The majority (5-4) opinion notes that affirmatively invoking the right to remain silent is not required in the context of custodial interrogations (i.e. asking questions after arrest).\n\nIn any event, rather than getting into the minutiae of how and when to invoke the right to remain silent, there's a much easier rule of thumb: other than identifying yourself, don't answer police questions. Ever. On the street, at a traffic stop, on your doorstep. Just don't do it.\n\nIf there's even the slightest chance that you'll say something that might incriminate you later (if asked what you had for breakfast and you answer \"cereal\" when in fact you ate eggs, and that is discovered later, not only is that evidence that you told a lie and can't be trusted, but lying to the police might be a crime in and of itself), there's no benefit to answering. You don't get a gold star or get a break next time you're in trouble. Police ask questions to get convictions. Period.\n\nIf you feel compelled to explain yourself, you can say \"Respectfully, I understand you have a job to do but my attorney advised me never to answer police questions without him/her present. Should I give him/her a call?\"\n\nAlways lawyer up.",

He was then asked about matching the shotgun shells from the incident to his shotgun (which is impossible, but he didn't know that) and he went silent. I think Doyle is still good law and the holding is limited to instances where a defendant is talking to cops and then stops on an inculpating question without explicitly invoking the right. Yes, still a shit holding, but pretty narrow.",

Police and prosecutors can use evidence and testimony collected via illegal action as long as it was not the government that broke the law. If a thief breaks into a house and finds photos/video of a crime and turns it over to the police, it can be used as evidence.\nOr, more peversely, if you \"illegally\" record a cop in say, Florida, you cannot submit that evidence in defence, but the prosecution could.",
