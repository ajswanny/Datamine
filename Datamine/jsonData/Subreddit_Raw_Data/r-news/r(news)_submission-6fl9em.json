I guess Trump could have gone ahead and made an ISP CEO Chairman, and that might've been worse, but at least it would have been more obvious.\n\nEven worse? Ajit Pai is a monster. Not the metaphorical kind either. He is literally an undead dingo the size of a mid-sized sedan that goes around eating children under the age of three, all without causing the slightest disquiet to those around him. Those following Ajit's career have labelled this \"the Derry Effect.\" We've reviewed over 50,000 police reports involving children under the age of five between 2010 up to the present date, for Maryland and the District of Columbia, analyzed them with a deep-learning algorithm trained on confirmed Ajit kills, and discovered that he's been devoured nearly 12,300 infants, children, and unborn feti since he was made commissioner in 2012, almost all of which were falsely flagged as kidnapping or SIDS, even when factual evidence (like the presence of bones or disembodied appendages) made these conclusions unlikely.\n\nWe've lost at least three investigators trying to get close to him. He appears to live in the tunnels beneath central D.C., and we've had at least one report that he keeps the heads and spines of his victims down there somewhere, spinal cords wrapped around disused utility pipes, allowing the brains to 'ripen' with rot, which Ajit Pai, Chairman of the FCC, appears to prefer.\n\nSo yeah. Real-life horror show. Trump put a literal monster into power at the FCC.\n\nAlso? He's a shitty lawyer. Almost every legal conclusion he's ever advanced ('almost' because I haven't reviewed his pre-FCC work yet) is hilariously wrong, and his rhetoric is garbage too. You can see him fumbling standard Republican rhetoric very badly recently, too.",

They existed before the internet so they know how to survive.\n\nStates need to be more responsible and man up and instate their own net neutrality. They're the ones that enabled telecom companies to pocket billions of dollars back in the 90s, not the federal government. The government signed the check and the states let telecom companies line their pockets.\n\nI'm still waiting for state and federal governments to sue all the telecom companies that pocketed money back in the 90s instead of installing fiber across the nation. That's at least \"$200billion\" + inflation of tax dollars that citizens deserve a refund from.\n\nIf your state representative doesn't care about net neutrality that's where the fixing needs to start. If your representative doesn't care then nothing is going to happen no matter how many FCC rulings there are.\n\nStop making this a bi-partisan issue. Deal with the person, not the party. The party means dick-all after they're elected. If ISP companies tries to bully your state over poles, ground wires, and cell towers they should be told flat-out to fuck off. All ISP companies want to do is own those wires, they don't care if they're providing you with a service. Once they own those wires free-market dies.\n\nTL;DR Corporate action = worthless.

Your representative is essentially uncritically toeing the party line.\n\n(2) There is no wireline competition in the USA. Wired Internet infrastructure is a natural monopoly, and anyone claiming a need to promote competition doesn't know what they are talking about. We don't need competition, because competing against a natural monopoly is irrational. You handle natural monopoly by regulating it until it isn't a threat to consumers. Dean Heller is, again, toeing the Republican party line. Republicans often refuse to acknowledge the effects of monopoly, and recently have completely refused to acknowledge it in the context of Net Neutrality.\n\n(3) Related to (2) above, the fact that he thinks competition is a priority, and he invokes it in giving you his personal guarantee, means you are talking to the Republican party, not a person. I know senators get retained like nobody's business, but this person does not need to be in a position of power anymore. If you get a form letter from the Republican party whenever you attempt to contact your elected official, it better goddamn be a fucking Representative. At minimum, this person should not be a Senator. ",

Than the iPhone came out and A: Rich demographics who could afford to be out of touch suddenly had the internet in their pocket and discovered it all at once, and B: the standard computer shifted so dramatically that \"not doing computers\" simply wasn't an option anymore. Only the most out of touch person still clings to the \"why do poor people have smartphones\" argument. Typically the earliest adopters of smartphones for whom the product was always a luxury item, for them their first exposure to the the internet was as a luxury. \n\nApple's shtick around 2006 was user friendliness. As a very poignant shower thought once said, \"The fact that a 4 years old kid can use an smart phone does not mean the kid is a genius, it means engineers are.\" People don't actually understand the devices they're using, Apple simply idiot-proofed them enough for our world to fully integrate technology into our day to day lives, and... that's fine, it really is; the combine harvester allowed more people to eat food without having to know farming, this allowed ignorance is a mark of progress. When people use computers they still are limited in their understanding. Buzz words like \"fast lanes\" sound nice because it's something they understand in the real world. The language used to argue against net neutrality is, at best, meaningless and, at worst, so flagrantly manipulative it's very breadth implies malice and contempt for consumers. \n\nThe other issue is economics. Economics is something the layperson inflates they're knowledge on the subject more so than any other discipline; consider that people get PhDs in economics while your average american had half a semester in highs school in an underfunded classroom. Net neutrality isn't an anti-corporate position (quite the opposite), but it has been championed to benefit an industry. Many Americans have tied and politicized the benefit of any industry as a universal good, and inversely another side has politicized the success of an industry as bad (I shan't need say which orientations are which).\n\nFor as much as reddit likes to blather on about how republican voters are being sheep, there are just as many sheep on the democratic side. That is to say: the wisdom to trust people who know better than you on an issue does not impart actual knowledge on a subject (see climate change). The political right doesn't see arguments for net neutrality as apolitical because, well, it is political. And for as many ignorant people towing a party line because they adhere to an economic policy they don't actually understand, there are more than a few people looking across the aisle and seeing some dumb asses blathering on about net neutrality who can't actually tell you what a data packet is, let alone why a \"fast lane\" is one of the most disingenuous offers a company can make. \n\nTL:DR People need to learn about computers, and probably stop thinking they understand economics as well as they think they do.

The idea that an ISP would forgo investments to gain new rural customers because they wouldn't be able to throttle those customers access to certain network destinations is ridiculous.  This is akin to the claim that ISPs aren't profitable if they can't double-dip to milk money out of both customers and the network content providers.  Of course they're profitable from customer money by itself - that's the model that built the Internet to the success today and the reason the Net Neutrality fight exists is to prevent greedy ISPs from being able to double-dip with the content providers the same way cable television companies have double-dipped on customers as well as content providers (in the form of paid advertisements).  \n\nThe only way to justify throttling access to different parts of the internet is if an ISP adopts a \"No charge to customers\" model where their profit is based on billing content-providers for access to customers who are signed up for their network.  Obviously this idea run contrary to freedom of the content-providers.  So down with double-dipping ISPs and up with Net Neutrality. ",

She would have been terrible in a different way, but terrible none the less.\n\nThe issue I have is for the parties to be able to block out real candidates like Bernie, who everyone I knew wanted to see in the job. \n\nYou can't choose one issue and vote based on it. You have to look at what both candidates are offering and vote on who sucks less. These candidates both fucking sucked! Is it surprising so few people voted? Most people who didn't vote probably still don't think they should have, because they realize that there's no telling what Hillary would have done. While our current issues brought to fore by Trump wouldn't likely be happening, we would have whatever crazy shit Hillary would do in office to deal with instead. Maybe it would have been better, but the reason those people didn't vote for her is that we don't think she would have been better.\n\nIn fact, I know people who voted for Trump because after Bernie got snubbed, they absolutely wanted *anyone* in office other than Hillary. And these are liberals I'm talking about!\n\nOf course, my perspective is anecdotal, but if you think that can't apply to a lot more of the people who didn't vote, you should think on it some more and realize how much people are scared of Hillary.

The real meat of lobbying happens on golf courses and at private barbecues. A good lobbyist is a congressman's friend, or \"friend\" depending on the case. They'll play 9 holes of golf together and not talk shop at all. Later in the bar, something might come up, but nothing overt, just a friend talking about his job that *happens* to be related to a bill the congressman needs to vote on soon. The congressman doesn't see this as lobbying. He knows the guys a lobbyist, but they've golfed/drank/chatted through dozens of bills that have nothing to do with his company. \n\nShort of telling congressmen they can't have friends, there's no real way to counter this. These lobbyists are their peers, issues or not. And just like how your friends in high school had more influence in how you dressed and what music you listened to than your home life (home state to protract a metaphor), these peer groups of lobbyists have much more influence over votes than a voting public. When this is how you lobby, you don't need to spend that much money during the lobbying proper.\n\nThis is my biggest argument for term limits. These relationships forge over time, across multiple elections. The ability to casually cajole a vote to the point where a congressman thinks it's from their own subjective insight is a slower process than just throwing money at it, but it's a lot cheaper and more effective in the long term.

    "body": ">First, it will bring high-speed Internet access to more Americans. Without the overhang of heavy-handed regulation, companies will spend more building next-generation networks. As those networks expand, many more Americans, especially low-income rural and urban Americans, will get high-speed Internet access for the first time. And more Americans generally will benefit from faster and better broadband.\n\n>Second, it will create jobs. More Americans will go to work building these networks. These are good-paying jobs, laying fiber, digging trenches, and connecting equipment to utility poles. And established businesses and startup entrepreneurs alike will take advantage of the networks that they build to create even more jobs.\n\n>Third, it will boost competition. Title II was designed for a monopoly. And a regulatory framework designed for a monopoly will tend to move the marketplace towards monopoly. It should therefore come as no surprise that we have seen greater consolidation during the Title II era. Heavy-handed regulations are especially tough on new entrants and small businesses that don\u2019t have the armies of lawyers and compliance officers that large, well-established companies do. So if we want to encourage smaller competitors to enter into the broadband marketplace or expand, we must end Title II.\n\n\n>Fourth, this proposal is the best path toward protecting Americans\u2019 online privacy. Privacy is a topic that has received a lot of attention lately. I understand that many disagreed with Congress\u2019 decision to stop the FCC\u2019s flawed privacy rules from going into effect later this year. But wherever you stand, one thing is indisputable: Congress was maintaining the status quo that the FCC put in place when it imposed Title II. That FCC decision actually stripped the Federal Trade Commission of its authority to regulate broadband providers\u2019 privacy and data security practices. That\u2019s because the FTC cannot regulate common carriers\u200a\u2014\u200awhich the prior FCC suddenly deemed broadband providers to be. This decision was a mistake.\n\nSource: https://medium.com/@timkarr/fcc-chairman-pai-speech-on-the-future-of-internet-regulation-ea9f43c24269",

Unfortunately these corporations have more power within our government than they should.  They have taken subsidies and not followed through on the promised implementations.  They are being allowed to enter into massive vertical monopolies - content creation, content distribution platforms and delivery process, communications, and more.  We're going backwards.  The various vertical industries should be split and the lowest level (ISP) should be regulated just like power distribution or telephone.  Telecom is a utility with the same infrastructural capital and regulatory requirements and should be treated as such.

It's like the issue of privacy: Not everyone gives a shit about the same things, so if you make the wrong argument they'll just say \".... so what?\" because they honestly don't care.\n\n- Do you talk about \"The Internet Fast Lane\" and how that really just means slowing everything else down? Not everyone needs fast Internet - as long as it's fast enough for Facebook they're happy.\n\n- Do you talk about how it could be used to stifle competition, making it nearly impossible for competitors to companies like Netflix to ever establish themselves? Well, turns out a lot of people are really happy with their Netflix subscription and don't care if it has any competitors.\n\n- Do you talk about how it could result in the sale of \"Internet Packages\" like you currently get with Cable TV? I find people tend to write me off as a tinfoil-hat conspiracy theorist for this one. It sounds too farfetched. \n\n- Even just saying \"They could slow Netflix down and make you *and* Netflix pay more to bring it back up to where it is now\" often yields the response, \"Well it's more money for the companies right? That can only be a good thing.\"\n\nI don't know. I've found it's a really hard subject to talk to people about.\n\n**Edit:** There's also the comparison to other services, such as electricity.

I'd definitely be down with doing this, but I have no idea where to start. Just create a subreddit for this specific purpose to coordinate things? Anyone who has organized events before can step right up and hold my hand.\n\nEDIT 2: Alright everyone, if we are doing this we need to coordinate a day and I vote for coordinating it with their protest, so July 12th. Everyone can obviously do it when they want to, just the 12th seems like the most logical day. Also, to those against it saying that Netflix isn't against NN, rather they just don't want to deal with it, here's the deal. When someone or something has that much wealth and power, so much so that they could make a significant difference in people's lives, they have an obligation, no, a responsibility, to do so. There is no place for a company that large to simply say that they don't want anything to do with it just because they think they've paid their dues. \n\nSpread the word. July 12th.
