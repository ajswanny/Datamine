    "body": "I'm not sure if it's really being appreciated just how *comprehensively* the Republicans were just fucked over.\n\nSee, the Republicans have been trying to pass these godawful healthcare bills through a process called budget reconciliation, which, among other things, protects the bill from being filibustered in the Senate and only requires a simple majority of 50 votes (rather than 60, which the Republicans don't have). \n\nThe thing is, the Senate can only consider one budget reconciliation bill per topic per year. Of course, if the bill dies in committee and never comes to an official vote, it doesn't count- which is why they've been able to keep hammering away at the issue.\n\nThis bill, though, was allowed to come to the Senate floor, because the Republicans thought they'd secured the votes. Collins, Murkowski and the Democrats would vote no, everyone else would vote yes, and Pence would break the tie. *And then McCain completely fucked them.* And it was almost certainly a calculated move; he voted to allow the bill to come to the floor. Had McCain allowed it to die in committee, McConnell could have come back with yet another repeal bill; but he let it come to a vote, and now they can't consider another budget reconciliation bill for the rest of the fiscal year. The Senate needs 60 votes to pass any kind of healthcare reform now.\n\nSo now they're caught between a rock and a hard place. Either they concede defeat on the issue and try again later (causing a big, unpopular stink that could damage elections if they try it before the midterms, or risking losing the slim majority they already have if they wait) or they actually sit down with the democrats like adults and write a halfway decent healthcare bill.\n\nThis is amazing.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nEDIT: Clearing up some things about budget reconciliation and what \"topics\" means.\n\nFrom this article:\n>Under Senate interpretations of the Congressional Budget Act, the Senate can consider the **three basic subjects of reconciliation \u2014 spending, revenues, and debt limit** \u2014 in a single bill or multiple bills, but it can consider each of these three in only one bill per year (unless Congress passes a second budget resolution). Consequently, in the Senate there can be a maximum of three reconciliation bills in a year, one for each of the basic subjects of reconciliation.\n\n>This rule is most significant if the first reconciliation bill that the Senate takes up affects both spending and revenues. Even if that bill is overwhelmingly devoted to only one of those subjects, no subsequent reconciliation bill can affect either revenues or spending because the first bill already addressed them.\n\nEmphasis mine.\nBudget reconciliation wasn't actually meant to be used for healthcare bills, it's meant to be used for, well, budgetary concerns. They're forcing a square peg in a round hole by arguing that the funding and tax portions of the ACA fall under \"budget legislation\", so that makes things a bit weird.\nThe ACA repeal bill would, I believe, affect the \"spending\" and \"revenues\" subjects; so they've now basically blown their chance at passing anything else through reconciliation this fiscal year.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n(someone please correct me if any of this is wrong/inaccurate)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n(Edit: Oh wow, first gold! Thanks, stranger.)",

I can respect them.\n\nTo the ~~Reich~~ Right however, you vote the way we tell you to vote or you're out. \n\nCongress is voting on what to have for lunch. For some reason, a lot of the red team want a shit sandwich. There's a group of people on the red team however who know shit sandwiches are not food. If all of them vote no to shit sandwiches every day, their membership on the red team might be questioned. They're not \"real\" red team... So just enough of them say no today. And just enough of them say no tomorrow. And just enough of them the next day.... It may always look like we're all about to be eating shit sandwiches, but there are enough people taking turns being \"not real\" red team and mixing it up to let us eat salad or burgers or anything but shit sandwiches.\n\nEven if you disagree with some of their ideas, you got to realize that those guys are trying to do what they think is right, and maybe give them a smidge of respect.\n\nTo use MMORPG terminology, we've got a hidden team of republicans kiting this bitch and they take turns tanking the aggro.",

Can you imagine that par-broiled jackhole coming up after that concession and doing her best Donald Trump-lite bullshit of blaming everyone?   \n\nShe was soooo pissed about not getting to do it too, even though no one had ever let a VP candidate take a podium and do so.  She even wrote about it in her book.\n\nMcCain, ever the statesman, declined to roast her for her own mistakes and moved on.  He had every right too considering she is a class A idiot, IMHO.
