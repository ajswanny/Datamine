    "body": "Doctor here - before everyone starts thinking that marijuana outperforms seizure medication, there is *no evidence* that this is the case, and even in this case, there is a clear *appearance* of benefit but we do not fully understand it.\n\n**Conventional anti-seizure medications have significantly improved the lives of millions of people!**  They don't always work and there are benefits and risks (some people experience horrible side effects), but the evidence supporting the use of anti-seizure medications (off patent!) is overwhelming.\n\nhttps://qz.com/886318/an-analysis-of-10000-scientific-studies-on-marijuana-concretely-supports-only-three-medical-benefits/\n\nMarijuana and cannabis products are studied worldwide (yes, there are schedule restrictions in the US but this is not the only country of study), and cannabis generally has mild positive effects for most diseases compared to standard treatments.  Seizures included.\n\nI too have had patients claiming cannabis oil miracles; 1 year later, we're switching treatments because cause and effect wasn't as clear as this article makes it out to be.  This is the problem with anecdotes... is this news article more important than my anecdote about switching OFF cannabis oil because seizures returned?  No!  This is why we need placebo randomized-controlled studies, **which haven't been done.**  Would de-listing schedule one help in the US?  Absolutely!  But worldwide, cannabis is being studied (thousands of articles yearly), and they all come up pretty short of \"omg amazing\"\n\nFrom the Cochrane study on cannabis for seizure disorders: \n\n>Authors' conclusions\n\n>No reliable conclusions can be drawn at present regarding the efficacy of cannabinoids as a treatment for epilepsy. The dose of 200 to 300 mg daily of cannabidiol was safely administered to small numbers of patients generally for short periods of time, and so the safety of long term cannabidiol treatment cannot be reliably assessed.\n\nDo these claims warrant more study? absolutely!  But before reddit gets all green-leafy on this one, it's very important to separate the *science of medical marijuana* from the *recrational use of marijuana* or the *perceived benefits socially of allowing marijuana use*.\n\nThe science of medical marijuana for epilepsy is *very weak*.\n\nEdit:  From a recent open-label trial in *the Lancet*:\n\n**Adverse events were reported in 128 (79%) of the 162 patients** within the safety group. Adverse events reported in more than 10% of patients were somnolence (n=41 [25%]), decreased appetite (n=31 [19%]), diarrhoea (n=31 [19%]), fatigue (n=21 [13%]), and convulsion (n=18 [11%]). **Five (3%) patients discontinued treatment because of an adverse event.** **Serious adverse events were reported in 48 (30%) patients, including one death\u2014a sudden unexpected death in epilepsy regarded as unrelated to study drug.** 20 (12%) patients had severe adverse events possibly related to cannabidiol use, the most common of which was **status epilepticus (n=9 [6%])**\n\nMany patients who were open-label given cannabidiol experienced a seizure frequency increase!\n\nAnd Edit 2:  The above lancet study was done *in the USA*.  Schedule 1 is a problem, but it is one scientists are working around.",

There is probably a lot of brain activity that is still unregulated and isn't functioning optimally. It's better, no doubt. But epilepsy patients will still have residual effects, like memory and motor control issues even when their seizures are controlled by medication. \n\nSecond, cannabis oil isn't some miracle wonder drug that cures all. Like any medicine, it's got advantages and disadvantages. Long term memory issues, and if it's a carcinogen are still up for debate. Because of it's classification, it hasn't been studied or examined in any long term sense, which is absolutely needs to be.\n\nEpilepsy is a diverse and complicated medical disorder, and the ways we treat it are still being fine tuned. Does cannabis cure it? No, but can it treat it? We are not sure, because it's not being studied in labs the way it should. Lots of neurologists I've talked to still treat it mostly by trying different meds and hoping for the best. \n\nTLDR: Epilepsy is complicated. Use of cannabis oil hasn't been shown to help it, except in anecdotal cases, like this one. Should it be studied? Absolutely. Is it a miracle cure all? No. Can it improve some people's quality of life? Yep. So let's find out. \n\nedit: grammer.",

So in these cases I had to go to the ER and receive a shot of adenosine. This thing basically restarts your heart rhythm and makes you feel like your heart just stopped and you're about to die. Not fun, but it does stop the episodes. During my treatment I had to do this twice. After the second time I saw a cardiologist who put me on medication to lessen the severity of these episodes. They still happened, but only up to 160bpm and at max a few minutes. I'm telling you all this because the day I had my mediport removal surgery they stopped entirely. Just like that they were gone. I could sleep again without worrying about it. I could exercise again. I was almost happier about that than I was about going into remission lol.",

    "body": "My neurologist flat out told me years ago to try cannabis. She was a recent graduate from UBC at the time and fairly young. I told her I used to smoke weed and it was fine for a while but then I started getting paranoid and anxious. She prescribed it anyway and sent me to this dispensary that's right next to the hospital. Most people in there were quite obviously very sick. Some patients were in wheelchairs and had a nurse/caretaker with them. \n\nAt the time, I needed a proper membership first that required getting passport photos and a bunch of documents including a prescription from a legitimate doctor (so, not a doctor who works in the back and who earns extra money from prescribing it like some dispensaries do). Now you just need an ID and no membership. \n\nAnyway, the ones she recommended were sativa/cbd mixes. I got it in pill, honey and oil form at first and it helped like crazy. I asked them if I could get cannabis to smoke after a few months and they said yes and that I didn't have limitations. My medication for seizures (Lamictal) helped maybe 50%. Cannabis was a game changer though. I still get the occasional seizure because the form of epilepsy I have is quite severe (I used to have grandmal's every day) but that's mostly when I lay off the cannabis for a few days. \n\nI've had a few arguments about this on reddit before and it's quite annoying and frustrating. Remembering I couldn't function and knowing it helped me from that point on is proof enough that it does work. But some people insist it's just a coincidence and my TLE just happened to fix itself somehow. I really wish people were less stubborn about this sort of thing because it made a huge difference in my life and other epileptics lives. \n\nWhen my neurologist - years later - went on mat leave, my new neurologist was this older man in his mid-late 60s. He saw I was prescribed that and voided the prescription. Thankfully, my dispensary still let me take it because they could see a significant difference in me. When my old neuro came back from mat leave, it seemed like she raised hell because of all these voided prescriptions and somehow managed to get it all re-approved by the hospital again. They did become stricter for a while but I fit the bill and qualified anyway due to the severity of my condition. \n\nNow both the hospital and the dispensary are completely lax about it. \n\nAlso, my friend who has MS which got progressively worse kept saying she can't smoke/take cannabis because of anxiety as well. I was telling her for months to at least give the CBD pills a shot. She finally agreed and things improved so much for her. Now she grows her own weed and does jiujitsu. She still has the occasional flare-up but nothing nearly as bad as what she used get. There were times when she couldn't move and there was nothing we could do to help her. I'm not calling cannabis the miracle drug but I know that at least in my experience, I have seen some pretty fucking miraculous results. \n\nEdit: I also hate saying this and sounding like an ageist asshole but every time I had an issue with a doctor (whether it's a neurologist or a psychiatrist for my severe ADHD) they were always over 60 years old. It's time to move on and move forward. It's time to acknowledge the *legitimate* results seen in patients. I'm not here to trash Big Pharma because Lamictal and my ADHD meds did help me, but there are alternative methods and I'm sick of them treating it like it's some sort of holistic mumbo-jumbo. ",

Part of the problem is the clinical trial data, control/uniformity of dosage, repeatability of manufacture, stability, etc. 99% of time this stuff is here to help you, and you should be happy it's there. \n\nMost of you don't give a rip about cleaning validation, viable/non viable particulate monitoring, or vapor phase hydrogen peroxide cycles used in isolators used to make your medicine...you don't want to hear about the years of effort needed to run a clinical trial, run blinded packages through a supply chain for years of aggravation, only to see the drug fail in a large, multi center trial or share tears with the patients that you've attempted to serve...but these are part of the reason it takes so much damn time to register an IND/NDA. It's the reason COPS are through the roof, and the reason we don't have as many thalidomide incidents. Honestly,  we don't spend a lot of time plotting ways to ruin your day, especially when our families suffer from the same afflictions. \n\nEven the FDA, and some of the greatest minds in the world, are subject to their own biases, including the need for a dichotomy in the space of science and the unknown/unexplained. \n\nBut yea, your theory works too.

It sounds like I wasn't having anywhere near as many seizures as you (about 35 in high school and only 5 since then), but I was put on Depakote, Dilantin, and several other (primarily) anti-depressants throughout high school that not only didn't help, but made it worse in some cases (Depakote gave me 5 in one night at a fateful sleepover - my personal record) and my mental capacity certainly suffered for it. I remember sitting in honors English writing an essay and just not being able to remember words.\n\nFast forward to college, I start to experiment with the wacky and suddenly I am able to get a grasp on my life. I've been 5 years removed from having a seizure and can finally think about getting my license thanks to the occasional puff. \n\nWe need to remove the Schedule 1 designation so that we can do real FDA testing and catch up with the rest of the world.",

Took Pentaza, Azacol, some third thing I can never remember. Every year in the autumn, another flare-up. Take Entocort for a while to suppress it. None of the meds did anything to control the flow problem. I would overreact to anti-diarreals to the point where they would shut everything down completely and I'd be constipated for days. Also extremely painful and hard to do anything about.\n\nSometime in 2010, I took a few drags off a joint with friends (I had smoked a bit in college, but it had been probably 6 years since I'd had any cannabis). Took maybe five minutes between smoking and this amazing sensation of my bowels just slowing the fuck down. It didn't stop me up, but I didn't have anymore BMs that day and the next morning, I had the closest thing I'd had to a solid shit in about 5 years.\n\nNow, I've been smoking practically daily since then and haven't had one single flare-up since. Sometimes if I eat food that's too spicy or something I'll have a brief issue, but it corrects itself the way it's supposed to. I've been able to live a normal life that was previously unavailable to me. I was not able to get much exercise before because the chafing of it all hurt so bad. I've lost 45 pounds since then. I ran 114 miles last month. I feel incredible.\n\nI hold a steady job. I have two kids who are healthy and active. I am not a deadbeat. But nevertheless if the law catches me, I'm screwed. I could go to jail or have my kids taken away from me.\n\nYeah, dude, it helps. It helps so much in so many ways. Just be careful about it. I moved to a legal state to lessen the severity of the crime of treating my illness. For what it's worth, all of my doctors know I smoke pot to solve my Crohn's and IBS and not one of them wants me to stop.",

You couldn't see the person next to you at the peak of it and everyone had to stay in the room for 5 minutes after the last oil was placed on the coals. Nobody had anything happen other than a coughing fit and a few people vomited because of a lower tolerance. \n\n\n\nPersonally I have been a heavy user from the start and I took a month long tolerance break once to \"reset\" myself and enjoy it more again. Well I decided what's better than to come back to thc with a half gram dab. This was about 80% so I was really only ingesting <400mg in one hit. This is still a very high dose but something I could do and still cook dinner after before my break. Well I blacked out for 6 hours after the hit. I would really like to do it again only if I were hooked up on monitors or in a scanner to see learn what's actually going on inside me. \n\n\n\nThere has been a few people to have smoked themselves 20+grams in one sitting. The current record being 34grams in 8minutes. \n\n\n\nI believe I saw somewhere that the estimated \"overdose\" dosage for someone with a zero tolerance is 40,000mg or 40grams of pure thc. And currently that would cost upwards of 4 thousand dollars. Not a lot of money in this industry buy any means but nobody's done it yet. \n\n\n\nOnce we can get intravenous thc (shouldn't be far away) we will find the truth as to wether or not you can die from thc alone.

This one time I ended up at the ER because I thought I was having a heart attack (I was only 22 at the time) and they said it was just a panic attack. They prescribed me ativan. I got absolutely hooked and getting off of that stuff after two months was the worst goddamn thing that happened in my adult years. Vomiting, hallucinations, irritability, crying fits, more anxiety attacks etc. It was brutal. Eventually I learned some breathing exercises as lame as that sounds. I can still feel anxiety coming on but 99% of the time, I manage to keep it at bay and not let it turn into a full blown attack. \n\nCannabis on the other hand just makes me feel more relaxed. I think the stuff that gave me anxiety attacks prior to the prescription was indica. I know some people say that indica is better for anxiety but the couch-potato/unable to move thing made me so paranoid and anxious I quit it up until my neurologist prescribed cbd/sativa. Sativa makes me creative and I move around and have energy. She thinks it's because of the ADHD that I could not handle indica for some reason. I need to DO something and be on the move and the couch-potato weed just made me feel like I wasn't in my own body. People often forget that there's different strains and that they affect you in unique ways. When someone tries to tell me that all weed smokers are lazy assholes, I want to punch them. ",

And, by massively expanding the prison industrial complex, they've accomplished that in large part, over the course of the last few decades. To acknowledge the CIA's role, Law Enforcement's role, Judges, DA's, the Federal Govt (in both Repub and Democratic admins) role is to admit to the faces of its victims, in real time, that depriving life/liberty/property has been not the bug, but the feature of the worst kind political cynicism imaginable. It is so pervasive a moral burden that many are content to ignore that it happened, so as to preserve their moral fantasies about how they are, deep down, good people. \n\nedit: added link.",

That's a whole other world of medicating, I can and have calmed active panic attacks in seconds with people who have high anxiety and paranoia with certain strains. \n\nThe thing is, most people don't even know what the word terpene is. Terpenes are what create the effects that piggy back on thc, they determine the medical effect and the \"high\" you'll get. MJ is a deeply complicated plant, I can get you fucked(read: couch locked) or just mildly medicated with the same strain, vaporization allows you to control the power of the effect, want to feel lightly medicated? 170 Celsius, want to get it good? 190, want to get fucked? 210 and no higher or you get really close to combustion ranges.\n\nInterested in more knowledge?

I like getting high, there's definitely at least a little recreational aspect to usage, and I don't think there's anything wrong with that, either.

Of course international \"law\" is not really law, it's basically \"recommendations\" that your country has to follow to stay in the club. Now, when countries like Uruguay and Canada, or states like Colorado and Washington go fully legal, they're in violation of UN treaties and other countries (ie, the states) will bully them if they're so inclined (and I think a lot of right-wing Americans in 2017 are so inclined).

Undoubtedly, if \"big pharma\" could continue to profit off the sales of their brand-name anti-epileptics without competition from a simple plant, this makes a lot of sense.\n\nHowever, this isn't the case... because if it were, CBD pills would (unfortunately) already be patented & sold in pill-form by GSK/Pfizer/AstraZeneca, not only because they'd work, but more-so because ALL the currently efficacious treatments we have for patients with chronic and/or refractory epilepsy have been off-patent & generic for quite some time now\n\nThe barrier to research in this instance isn't because the pharmaceutical industries are barring entry... it's because marijuana is a schedule I substance and they literally CAN'T do research into its benefits without appealing to the FDA... who has to then appeal the DEA... who will laugh & keep the status-quo\n\nSorry for the rant...
