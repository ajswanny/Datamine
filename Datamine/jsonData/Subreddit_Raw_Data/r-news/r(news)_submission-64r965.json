They exist to promote goods and services over their airways, and in turn, to generate revenue. They seek to keep you entertained for 15-min blocks, just enough to compel your viewership through a 2-3 min stop-set of advertisers. \n\nThe fact that their programming may be related to current events (what we colloquially call \"the news\") is by happenstance. To wit, if these so-called \"cable news\" channels could make money by airing chimps flinging their own poo, then that would exist tomorrow, and Wolf Blitzer would be out of a job.\n\nIf you want real \"capital-J\" journalism, then you gotta go with print journalism. Does print also exist because of advertisers? Sure, of course it does, but there, the mandate to generate public-service and accountability journalism is legitimate.

Republicans in this case are backing farmers rights to apply tons of fertilizers because if they don't then they will most likely not have as abundant of a crop. It's a failure of everything. Everything is fucked up about this situation and now des moines is shorted and has extremely poor quality of water due to the 3 counties they sued are still dumping. Des moines water also probably won't get shaken up. \n\nThere is a way to resolve this, but it takes years and will hurt revenue to the state, and to even start paying for this they have to cut out some of the funding for education. Basically, the solution is to plant trees and grass alongside streams and have a 35 foot buffer zone. However, this obviously makes less land farmable and it costs money to the state and farmer to start doing this around every stream ie the state has to help fund this.\n\nHowever, this water issue is even bigger than just Des moines. The dead zone down by Louisiana is caused by the EXACT same thing that's caused Des Moines water to be of poor quality. Basically, unless the state gets more funding to create more buffer zones between the farm land and the streams and rivers, the dead zone will keep growing and water quality throughout Iowa is going to get worse.

Usually this is then applied in the spring before planting but a small corn plant can't use 150 pounds of N right away and being that N moves in the soil with water some of the N leaches  away. \n\nA smarter way to manage N is to calculate the amount needed and apply some in the spring before planting and some when the crop is about knee high. This is called a split application and and helps to save the farmer money by reducing leaching which wastes nitrogen. ",

Des Moines and the college towns are doing OK, but the rest of the state has been in a long decline that's gone on for at least a few generations and has only picked up speed lately.  Farming needs fewer farmers and its economic benefits go increasingly to the few.  All the top 10-20% of students in my high school left Iowa.  Think for a while what that does to a place after even a short time.  I don't know anyone I was even loosely friends with that stayed in my hometown after HS.  Very encouraging to see people like these journalists fighting the good fight in what must seem like a losing battle against spiraling economic and cultural decline.  I was already repelled in high school in the late 90s with an aggressive culture of \"dumb\" in my hometown, but nothing's gotten better since then I'm afraid.  This is one of the whitest areas of the country, but you'd be amazed how much time people spend there worrying about various minorities.  Anger, ignorance, a sense of doom and abandonment.  Thus, Steve King.  And yes, they very much must want to \"MAGA,\" because where they live is a shadow of its formal self.  ",

Pigs are proven to prefer stalls and come back to the same one time after time (like dogs and dairy cattle).\n\nAgain not trying to be aggressive, I'm genuinely curious about opinions of others.

Views are worth something to someone and sure you might lose the ford account but if you had a paper with ethical leadership and there was a market for views, you would always be able to find advertisers.  The real problem though is that views are not worth enough.  Which means you need more content to drive up view numbers.  Which means you can spend less time and money on each piece of content.

    "body": "Sure.\n\nBasically, the idea is that the mass media is structured in such a way that it ultimately functions as propaganda for maintaining the status quo without even being directly coerced to do so. In the book, this is called the \"propaganda model\" Explaining _how_ the propaganda model works is easier if you first understand _why_ it exists in the first place.\n\nTo cut straight to the point: a democratic form of government is a threat to the economic and political elite. If the masses hold power, they can dismantle the power structures that rule them. So if you're a member of this class, the question is, \"how can the existing power structures be maintained/reinforced without resorting to blatant authoritarian rule (which the public would not tolerate)?\" And the answer, as they've figured out, is that you get the public to voluntarily consent. If you can get the public on board, there's no need to be authoritarian. In fact, voluntary support is _better_ in the long run, because the public happily does the bidding of its elites.\n\nAlright, so that's why. But what about the how? How can the elites just go and \"manufacture\" this consent? Surely the public would be too smart for that, right? Chomsky (the co-author of the book) explains:\n\n> \"The smart way to keep people passive and obedient is to strictly limit the spectrum of acceptable opinion, but allow very lively debate within that spectrum - even encourage the more critical and dissident views. That gives people the sense that there's free thinking going on, while all the time the presuppositions of the system are being reinforced by the limits put on the range of the debate.\"\n\nThe media would not exist without two things: 1) funding and 2) access to information. The crux of the book is essentially that the media naturally self-censors without any coercion because it is totally reliant on the economic elite for funding and almost totally reliant on the political elite for information. \n\nOn #1: Every major media source derives the majority of its revenue from advertising. The for-profit nature of mass media means that media outlets don't just need to worry about losing advertisers; they also have to worry about _growing_ their advertiser support. Suprise! Guess who advertisers represent? The economic elite. The advertiser-driven model means that the mass media must produce a steady stream of content that draws consumers to consume lots of bite-size content rather than long-form content. More content = more advertising opportunities. This is why you don't see much serious investigative reporting anymore. It takes serious time to produce, and it brings in less money from advertisers. It just doesn't pay the bills.\n\nWhich leads nicely into #2: With constant pressure to churn out content, the media relies on getting easy access to credible information. What source is generally seen as credible? The government, of course. You don't even have to name _who_ in the government provided the information. You just have to say, \"A government source close to the situation says...\" and that's that. No need to follow-up and get a secondary source. That takes time anyway. Time is money. So the media's relationship with the state is _super_ important, because it's and easy source for an overwhelming amount of information. It's in their best interests to repeat the narratives they are given my the state.\n\n**TL;DR:** the media does the bidding of the economic elite (advertisers) as well as the political elite (government) without any direct collusion or coercion. Media would cease to function without the support of both. Upset the state, and you stop the flow of information. Stop the easy flow of information and producing content becomes much more difficult, leading to less content. If you can't produce much content, your advertising revenue drops, and you go out of business.\n\nLast thing: I probably did a real shit job of explaining that, so [I pasted a slightly longer summary from the author](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/64r965/a_smalltown_iowa_newspaper_with_a_staff_of_10/dg4wayx/) in a reply to this comment.",

The result is you have a local Farmer who needs to sell a crop at x because of regulations and other measures such as transportation, but the corporation can sell at y which is much lower point and sets the bar. So the farmer has to sell at y now and losses stack up against the lower class farmer, and this is where costs get cut, do you stick to the law or cut corners so you can put food on the table tonight. \n\nThis is why iowa went red this year, farmers have been getting fucked by regulation and massive corporations. While I do understand anger at pollution and I want a clean environment I understand why some of these Farmers are so pissed, and that's the thing many people in cities don't understand is that the people farming in the Midwest are just trying to feed their family like you. It's a complex issue with many working parts not just \"oh those redneck Farmers don't give a shit about the environment\" \n\nEdit: I'll also add in to people that say \"well just sell to big corporations then you can't keep up in the game anymore\" these people have had the \"family farm\" for generations, these were the people that came from nothing to own 100 acres of land that's been passed on for generations, and their children have been told their entire life this will be yours some day. There is so much pride in these families when you look into their eyes about where they grew up and what they have done to become hard working farmers, that when you say just move on, sell that farm, you are a failure, you just spit on generations of some of the hardest working people in the world. It's literally not their fault we've allowed mega corporations to thrive that destroy entire livelihoods because they can afford to undersell you at every point because you want your can of corn for .97 cents vs a $1.50   ",

    "body": "So I can start with a few more reasons why gestation stalls are beneficial as a whole. First, like I said in my original comment, the mother as well as the mothers around in a free range setting will lay on and crush the piglets in the pen. Secondly, it allows for individual care for piglets and sows. Again, we don't want our animals sick because then they don't produce as much and we make less money. It is beneficial to us (and the animal, but I'm looking at a purely business standpoint) to provide as much care as necessary. \n\nI tried to find the specific studies we learned about in class, but failed. I found references to these studies (or trials as I read in some places), but no actual hard data. Sows do typically prefer individual stalls because they don't have to fight other sows for food (pigs are very vicious creatures that will actually fight and maim other pigs which is why a group of pigs stays a group and no new pigs are added). \n\nI'm happy to answer your questions :) as an Animal Science major it feels like an obligation almost. Thanks for not taking offense!\n\nEdit: I found a study, not sure if it's the one I referenced earlier and it's from a biased source but I'll let you draw your own conclusions\n\nhttp://www.porknetwork.com/pork-news/research-shows-some-sows-prefer-stalls-114024219.html",

    "body": "A summary in Chomsky's own words ([source](https://chomsky.info/1992____02/)):\n\n> It\u2019s basically an institutional analysis of the major media, what we call a propaganda model. We\u2019re talking primarily about the national media, those media that sort of set a general agenda that others more or less adhere to, to the extent that they even pay much attention to national or international affairs.\n\n> Now the elite media are sort of the agenda-setting media. That means The New York Times, The Washington Post, the major television channels, and so on. They set the general framework. Local media more or less adapt to their structure.\n\n> And they do this in all sorts of ways: by selection of topics, by distribution of concerns, by emphasis and framing of issues, by filtering of information, by bounding of debate within certain limits. They determine, they select, they shape, they control, they restrict \u2014 in order to serve the interests of dominant, elite groups in the society.\n\n> The New York Times is certainly the most important newspaper in the United States, and one could argue the most important newspaper in the world. The New York Times plays an enormous role in shaping the perception of the current world on the part of the politically active, educated classes. Also The New York Times has a special role, and I believe its editors probably feel that they bear a heavy burden, in the sense that The New York Times creates history.\n\n> That is, history is what appears in The New York Times archives; the place where people will go to find out what happened is The New York Times. Therefore it\u2019s extremely important if history is going to be shaped in an appropriate way, that certain things appear, certain things not appear, certain questions be asked, other questions be ignored, and that issues be framed in a particular fashion. Now in whose interests is history being so shaped? Well, I think that\u2019s not very difficult to answer.\n\n> Now, to eliminate confusion, all of this has nothing to do with liberal or conservative bias. According to the propaganda model, both liberal and conservative wings of the media \u2014 whatever those terms are supposed to mean \u2014 fall within the same framework of assumptions.\n\n> In fact, if the system functions well, it ought to have a liberal bias, or at least appear to. Because if it appears to have a liberal bias, that will serve to bound thought even more effectively.\n\n> In other words, if the press is indeed adversarial and liberal and all these bad things, then how can I go beyond it? They\u2019re already so extreme in their opposition to power that to go beyond it would be to take off from the planet. So therefore it must be that the presuppositions that are accepted in the liberal media are sacrosanct \u2014 can\u2019t go beyond them. And a well-functioning system would in fact have a bias of that kind. The media would then serve to say in effect: Thus far and no further.\n\n> We ask what would you expect of those media on just relatively uncontroversial, guided-free market assumptions? And when you look at them you find a number of major factors determining what their products are. These are what we call the filters, so one of them, for example, is ownership. Who owns them?\n\n> The major agenda-setting media \u2014 after all, what are they? As institutions in the society, what are they? Well, in the first place they are major corporations, in fact huge corporations. Furthermore, they are integrated with and sometimes owned by even larger corporations, conglomerates \u2014 so, for example, by Westinghouse and G.E. and so on.\n\n> So what we have in the first place is major corporations which are parts of even bigger conglomerates. Now, like any other corporation, they have a product which they sell to a market. The market is advertisers \u2014 that is, other businesses. What keeps the media functioning is not the audience. They make money from their advertisers. And remember, we\u2019re talking about the elite media. So they\u2019re trying to sell a good product, a product which raises advertising rates. And ask your friends in the advertising industry. That means that they want to adjust their audience to the more elite and affluent audience. That raises advertising rates. So what you have is institutions, corporations, big corporations, that are selling relatively privileged audiences to other businesses.\n\n> Well, what point of view would you expect to come out of this? I mean without any further assumptions, what you\u2019d predict is that what comes out is a picture of the world, a perception of the world, that satisfies the needs and the interests and the perceptions of the sellers, the buyers and the product.\n\n> Now there are many other factors that press in the same direction. If people try to enter the system who don\u2019t have that point of view they\u2019re likely to be excluded somewhere along the way. After all, no institution is going to happily design a mechanism to self-destruct. It\u2019s not the way institutions function. So they\u2019ll work to exclude or marginalize or eliminate dissenting voices or alternative perspectives and so on because they\u2019re dysfunctional, they\u2019re dysfunctional to the institution itself.\n\n> Now there are other media too whose basic social role is quite different: it\u2019s diversion. There\u2019s the real mass media-the kinds that are aimed at, you know, Joe Six Pack \u2014 that kind. The purpose of those media is just to dull people\u2019s brains.\n\n> This is an oversimplification, but for the eighty percent or whatever they are, the main thing is to divert them. To get them to watch National Football League. And to worry about \u201cMother With Child With Six Heads,\u201d or whatever you pick up on the supermarket stands and so on. Or look at astrology. Or get involved in fundamentalist stuff or something or other. Just get them away. Get them away from things that matter. And for that it\u2019s important to reduce their capacity to think.\n\n> Take, say, sports \u2014 that\u2019s another crucial example of the indoctrination system, in my view. For one thing because it \u2014 you know, it offers people something to pay attention to that\u2019s of no importance. [audience laughs] That keeps them from worrying about \u2014 [applause] keeps them from worrying about things that matter to their lives that they might have some idea of doing something about. And in fact it\u2019s striking to see the intelligence that\u2019s used by ordinary people in [discussions of] sports [as opposed to political and social issues]. I mean, you listen to radio stations where people call in \u2014 they have the most exotic information [more laughter] and understanding about all kind of arcane issues. And the press undoubtedly does a lot with this.\n\n> You know, I remember in high school, already I was pretty old. I suddenly asked myself at one point, why do I care if my high school team wins the football game? [laughter] I mean, I don\u2019t know anybody on the team, you know? [audience roars] I mean, they have nothing to do with me, I mean, why I am cheering for my team? It doesn\u2019t mean any \u2014 it doesn\u2019t make sense. But the point is, it does make sense: it\u2019s a way of building up irrational attitudes of submission to authority, and group cohesion behind leadership elements \u2014 in fact, it\u2019s training in irrational jingoism. That\u2019s also a feature of competitive sports. I think if you look closely at these things, I think, typically, they do have functions, and that\u2019s why energy is devoted to supporting them and creating a basis for them and advertisers are willing to pay for them and so on.",
