Like no moral high ground at all for BOTH parents the entire time?!?! \n\nMy mind is blown away by this. You'd think for sure, at least 1 of 2 parents would break, and would've taken the kid to a hospital against the other SO's religious view, because just maybe God was napping on this one and a hospital may help. I mean it's technically the child who would be going against the \"religious views\", it's not as though the parent broke \"religious views\" for themselves right. They forced this kid to die and all they had to do was let the kid decide his fate and they could still keep their crazy views intact for themselves. They probably even visited hospitals growing up and not one questioned why they got to go to a hospital but their child doesn't...\n\nI'm so mad. Common sense and human instinct should have prevailed here. And to imagine the kid asking for help, for a long period of time, all of that, to be ignored his entire life by his own parents, and what about the other 7 siblings that didn't manage to get/find/ask outside people for help for him. The kid didn't even get to have a good life while it fleeted away so quickly and somehow not quickly enough for the pain he was forced to suffer by a \"family\" he never really had. Their life sentence should be life sentence with a side of constant torture while they slowly die. \n\nSorry for the rant; the human condition has always struck a cord with me in most everyone I meet or read of.

C'mon, grab a hold!\"\n\n\"No. I have faith that God will send a miracle!\"\n\nThe search and rescue foot team all shook their heads and continued on, \"Suit yourself...\"\n\nHours later, the man is starting to get tired from hanging and prays for God to send a miracle to save him.\n\nMinutes later, a S&R helicopter hovers overhead. A man is lowered down in a rope ladder. \"Sir! Search and rescue here to help. Go ahead and grab-\"\n\n\"Hey! Don't worry about it! God is going to send me a miracle to save me!\"\n\n\"...Sir, I'm here right now!\"\n\n\"No, don't worry about it! I have faith.\"\n\nThe S&R leaves and searches for other victims of the hurricane.\n\nHours pass and the man's limbs are aching. He prays to God, \"God, where are you? Please send a miracle to save me.\"\n\nMinutes later...\n\nA large S&R boat approaches down below. \n\n\"Sir! Search and rescue is here to help! You're in safe hands no-\"\n\n\"NO!

Literally let go and you'll land on our safety cushion and we'll get you covered in some warm blankets.\"\n\n\"No. God will help me.

He begins to pray, but his body gives out. He let's go and plummets to the flooding waters below. He dies.\n\nHe wakes up and finds himself in heaven, the realization that he had just died dawns on him.\n\nHe sees God and asks, \"God, I prayed for you to send a miracle to come save me!

All of the churches I've been to its been mostly 10-50 older patrons like 55+. Basically they just sound like they're scared of science because they don't understand it (shocker).

You may disagree with that premise and that's fine but the answer is the same - modern medicine. \"God's blessing\" is having access to the best health care system in the history of the human race. If you want to sit in prayer you do it next to a hospital bed, not at home. These people deserve to be in prison. \n\nStupid people latch onto all sorts of crazy things. Homeopathy. Healing crystals.

If I ever have kids, I want to raise them like those Christian kids.

Whatever helps people sleep at night or paint themselves as better at their job, I suppose.\n\nWhat do you mean? I think you may misread that, the social worker that saw him returned fought against his return, from the article:\n\n> Patricia MacDonald, the B.C. social worker who fought against Alex being returned to his parents, was in court for the verdict.\n\nAlex was the name of the boy also.  What likely happened was that social worker recommend he not be returned, but his parents brought in a lawyer, managed to get a judge to force his return or whatever process in place ultimately failed and saw his obviously incorrect return to his parents.   Generally child protective services *want* kids with their parents so long as their parents are suitable care givers, but it's a fine line. Do we err on the side of taking children from families who are suitable care givers in an abundance of caution, or err on the side of giving kids back to those that might not be?  It's tough for sure, but this one seems like someone really fucked up, but I don't think it was that social worker. \n \nEdit: fixed the error vs. err.

The day he was diagnosed, his skin was almost grey, his eyes were sunken in and had really dark circles around them. He was so lethargic that he could barely walk.

Schedule and consistency is incredibly important.  You are yet another stranger in a long list of strangers and meeting even daily scheduled expectations can ease their sense of not knowing what is going to happen.\n\n2.  Each individual is unique but no matter how seemingly warm or cold make verbalized consent part of their life.  Ask before you do things, or assume things, and especially before any type of physical contact.  Even things such as a pat on the shoulder should have clear consent.\n\n3.  If you can't commit, don't do it.  This is the harsh part where if you're not sure you can handle fostering/adoption you shouldn't.  You might hear how what you could provide is better than nothing, but that's not really true.  These teens have been failed over and over, and each failure makes it that much harder for the genuinely good situations to work out.  Instead try doing some volunteer work with teens, get involved in less binding ways first to test the waters.\n\nI hope this helped, it certainly gave me a lot to think about when I was in your shoes and considering the same.",

The internet wasn't huge at that point so there wasn't any webmd or anything to figure out what was wrong with him. My mother in law actually brought up diabetes and we asked them to test him. They collected a urine sample and said they would call with the results. We only lived a couple blocks from the doctor's office. Right when we got home they were calling us. They didn't even tell us what it was they just said to bring him to the children's hospital in St Paul immediately and hung up. Once we were at the children's hospital they wouldn't tell us anything either. He was there for 6 hours before a doctor finally said that he had type 1 diabetes and that was after he was admitted and got moved to a room upstairs.  We filed state complaints against the doctor's office and the hospital. I had my son a month after I turned 17 and a couple weeks before my husband turned 18. He was diagnosed on March 2nd, 1999. 20 days before my 19th birthday. He turns 20 years old in April. He's got a very nice girlfriend, a job where he makes $14/hour plus commission (averages out to be about $17/hour), and he is getting a business management degree. Guess my husband and I didn't do too bad for being labeled as dumb kids that didn't know anything. I mean we were but you just know when something is really wrong with your kid and it was maddening to be treated like we were just stupid. It certainly helped me to understand that I was always going to have to prove myself. Even things like him starting elementary school became us vs them. We changed doctors a lot because it was hard for a lot of pediatricians to take us seriously when they were still treating patients that were our age. ",

He saved us from Eden, and he saved us from a lifetime of zero freewill under the regime of God (the one who claims to have created the world and man). In short, God created us to be his perfect minions that did whatever he wanted of us (even though he knew we'd succumb to Satan anyways), and Satan freed us and allowed us to actually experience this weird shit we call life. \n\ni dunno, I'm high as shit and I'm not religious, but that whole concept is super interesting to me and makes a ton of fucking sense. I probably butchered my description of what I halfway remember reading about. \n\nedit// Even if God did create Eden for man to live happily ever after right off the bat, *why the fuck* is the snake in there? Why did he even make that an option? He knew Adam and Eve would fuck up. So really, *God* is the one who *knowingly* fucked over mankind and doomed us to a lifetime of suffering that we wouldn't have had in the first place. Then, since we have logic and reason now, he expects us to ignore all of it and blindly believe in and follow what appears to be some fairy tale shit? Like wtf, is he really that bored up there? It's like a crazy gameshow with really wacky, stupid rules that defy any sort of logic and make zero sense.\n\nAll in all, God seems like a real dick. Satan was a total homie and was lookin' out. ",
