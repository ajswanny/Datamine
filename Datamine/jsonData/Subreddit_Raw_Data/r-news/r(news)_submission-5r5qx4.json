A throwback from the incompetent Obama Administration... has betrayed the Department of Justice\"\n\nIt's so aggressive and standoffish. Is this how the US will speak to the larger international community too when they don't get their way or are questioned on their actions and reasons?\n\nWhat a swing, I thought Obama was always calm in his demeanor, chose his words perfect, well spoken, I always had the feeling he knew more than he was letting on but also have an element of security, that you're looked after no matter what and he genuinely cares.\n\nNow it's a man that I personally feel, is going to be obsessed with his own legacy - both while in office and for his business interests post leaving the Oval Office. His actions and words will always be a knee jerk reaction that's aim will be to one up or put someone down / shift blame to others. Anyone could be a target and they'll stop at nothing to get their way.\n\nThe rise of nationalism is a concern, not only because it is happening in the US, but because it is happening throughout the world while looking at the US to motivate those parties pushing for such beliefs. I wonder if we are entry a pre -war era similar to the 1920s full of economic uncertainty that fuels tensions and causes blame.

Let's go through the facts:\n\n[Tillerson was the CEO of Exxon for 10 years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rex_Tillerson), but he began working for them in 1975. He resigned his position as CEO in 2016. During his time at Exxon, he oversaw a [$720 million deal with the Russia state-owned oil company](http://www.forbes.com/sites/kenrapoza/2016/12/15/trump-russia-exxon-tillerson/#3f24ef2b3a63) to drill in Russia. In 2014, Obama levied sanctions against Russia that specifically included state-owned oil and energy companies, so the Exxon deal came to a screeching halt. If the sanctions are lifted, Exxon and the Russia-owned oil company stand to make billions and guess who has stakes in those companies? Tillerson and Putin respectively. \n",

First, the statement [AAG Yate's statement] seems to indicate that the executive order was reviewed by the Justice Department\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel, which apparently concluded that the executive order was lawful. Second, Yates does not claim that she cannot defend the executive order because it is unconstitutional or because the Justice Department would be unable to offer good-faith arguments in defense of its legality. To the contrary, Yates claims she is ordering the Justice Department not to defend the executive order because it is not \u201cwise or just.\u201d This is quite significant. I am not aware of any instance in which the Justice Department has refused to defend a presumptively lawful executive action on this basis.\"\n\n&nbsp;\n\nLet that sink in.",

If he doesn't misstep legally they can use their majority to declare him unfit for duty, and Pence takes over. Or they can simply pressure him to step down, allowing him to keep his pride but ending in the same result. \n\nAt that point we'd have a far right evangelical in office with a republican majority. The people (the majority of whom *didn't* elect Trump) are appeased, after all they have been calling for him to be impeached. But they don't realize they just got the greater of the two evils: a professional politician with capital to spend on the Hill and the backing of the religious right. \n\nIt's a perfect play if it's true.

On mobile and no idea how to link articles but I'll update when I can.\n\nedit: thanks /u/paulmcpizza for the link [Trial Balloon for Coup](https://medium.com/@yonatanzunger/trial-balloon-for-a-coup-e024990891d5#.sockua3il)\n\nedit 2: relevant sources for the claims found in the above article: \n\n[Business Insider article -- Memos: CEO of Russia's state oil company offered Trump adviser, allies a cut of huge deal if sanctions were lifted](http://www.businessinsider.com/carter-page-trump-russia-igor-sechin-dossier-2017-1)\n\n> A dossier with unverified claims about President Donald Trump's ties to Russia contained allegations that Igor Sechin, the CEO of Russia's state oil company, offered former Trump ally Carter Page and his associates the brokerage of a 19% stake in the company in exchange for the lifting of US sanctions on Russia.\n> \n> The dossier says the offer was made in July, when Page was in Moscow giving a speech at the Higher Economic School. The claim was sourced to \"a trusted compatriot and close associate\" of Sechin, according to the dossier's author, former British spy Christopher Steele.\n\n[Reuters -- How Russia sold its oil jewel: without saying who bought it](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-russia-rosneft-privatisation-insight-idUSKBN1582OH)\n\n> More than a month after Russia announced one of its biggest privatizations since the 1990s, selling a 19.5 percent stake in its giant oil company Rosneft, it still isn't possible to determine from public records the full identities of those who bought it.\n\n> The purpose of Russia's privatization program is to attract overseas money to cover a budgetary shortfall caused by low oil prices and Western sanctions. Putin has therefore banned Russian state-owned banks from participating in the financing of privatization deals, which would defeat the aim of bringing in foreign capital.\n\n> \"The main question in relation to this transaction, as ever, still sounds like this: Who is the real buyer of a 19.5 percent stake in Rosneft?\" Sergey Aleksashenko, a former deputy head of Russia's central bank, wrote in a blog last week.",

The spokesman said that continues to be the case in the first 10 days of the Trump administration.\n\n> \u201cOLC has continued to serve this traditional role in the present administration, and to date has approved the signed orders with respect to form and legality,\u201d the spokesman said. \n\n> But here\u2019s the key part of the statement: \u201cOLC\u2019s legal review has been conducted without the involvement of Department of Justice leadership, and OLC\u2019s legal review does not address the broader policy issues inherent in any executive order.\u201d \n\n> In other words, the Office of Legal Counsel approved the language and basic legality of the executive orders, but did not look at the broader potential impact and potential complications. And DOJ leadership, which in this case means acting Attorney General Sally Yates and others, were not involved in the process at all.\n\nIt's a cursory review with limited scope.  These are not the people you talk to when you want a thorough legal vetting of an executive order.",

All Trump cared about was getting himself the big chair and then was told after he won the electoral vote that he would have to replace the entire White House staff. He had to scramble to figure out who was going to do what, instead of being able to transition smoothly into a new cabinet. But, ya know, I'm obviously being biased. I mean, he ran for the office, but how was he supposed to know he'd have to do all that? It's not like he's a politician who's familiar with the law and how the country is run.",

As humans, and especially in a \"western\" society, we are taught from birth (and history) that there is always someone out there who knows more than you, who should be listened to, who will overpower you, sound like they know everything, seem so much more confident than you - whatever. \n\n\nThe problem is that we don't don't believe in ourselves. We have our own tormentors (call it what you want) that bring us down and continually compares us to the best aspects of others. Fuck that. If I lost my job or my family or my arms or my dog or my house - I will still be me. I don't need someone else to give me worth, or life, or a sense of belonging, and no one else can! Any expectations that I have of someone are MY expectations, and that isn't something I could fairly hold someone else too, so why do we hold someone else to our expectations? Especially when we *don't know each other* yet we are happy to judge them?\n\n\nYour life is yours. Don't let anyone tell you how to live your life - me especially! Live it your way, remove the labels that are put on each other, love life. What the fuck is the point in worry or stress?\n\n\n",
