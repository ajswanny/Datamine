He knew after Trump questioned him, that he would be thrown under the bus.

On the other side, Trump asked the AG, and the VP to leave the room so he could speak with Comey (even though the AG is Comey's boss and requested to remain). That shows that Trump knew there was something wrong with what he was doing. Intent all over the place. ",

To say he didn't do that is an understatement and is pretty out of character for a career politician on his way to the 2nd most powerful position in the US government. \n\nOnce the Flynn details start flying around, I'm not sure he comes out as squeaky clean as he looks right now. For example, if a single person can show that Pence knew about Flynn before Feb 14th (which I believe is the right day), he could be implicated as a conspirator to the whole Flynn debacle. \n\nAlso, once shit starts to go down you can 100% count on Trump dragging every fucking person down with him that he can. He will spill all the beans on each and every one of them. \n\nTHAT'S why the GOP is dragging their feet. Trump will say anything and everything to distract from his own failings. He has the constitution of a child. Every slight - real and perceived - will be thrown out there. ",

A group of people devoting their thoughts and emotions to one individual whom they see as infallible, a savior of sorts. They ignore facts and even contradictions from the man himself, or simply find excuses as to why these contradictions are meaningless. Anything negative reported on him is an attack from the liberal enemy. \n\nThese people are so far gone that even if they were presented with concrete evidence that he collided with Russia to influence the election today they would deny it. It's pretty crazy, I always knew people like this existed but seeing them so out in the open is pretty surreal. The narrative of trying to understand and reason with them that emerged after the election has to stop, it's simply impossible. The reasonable people that voted for him have already changed their minds or at the very least are acknowledging their doubts. The rest of them are gone, and honestly they should be left behind. They are a minority in this country, that's a fact.

I mean yeah, your friend hit that dude in a drunken fight, but the other guy from a rival town was a drunk, abused his wife, and always beat up other people at the bar, so maybe you lie to the cops a little. After all, you're really doing it for the greater good, right? The guy was a sleazeball, and hey it's your *friend* and you guys agree on everything!\n\nBut then you find out that maybe your friend lied a little bit about the other guy and he didn't *physically* abuse his wife, he just yelled at her a few times. But that's int he past now. What's important is that the other town has a football game with your town and you gotta make sure your town wins! And I mean their football players are known juicers, so you can't just let that slide without doing *something* to help your team. And I mean you guys are so tight. Remember that time you *lied to the police*? I mean you had to, right? Right? That proves what bros you guys are! And it shows the stakes here. So of course you tip off the authorities about the doping, and maybe you break into the lab to slip a little something into the urine. Just to make sure, you know, in case the tests were bad. \n\nOh, looks like the police are starting to investigate some corruption in your town and at the center of it all is your friend. Huh. Well that's no good. This is serious shit. I mean, it's clear they're out to get you. I mean why else would they even be looking, right? It's probably all the cops from the neighboring town behind it all anyway. They've obviously compromised your town's cops. You know how cops are. They are all corrupt. A corrupt brotherhood. Can't be trusted. And I mean what option do you have? You have to fight it. They're just gonna distort everything that happened anyway. They don't understand. They aren't putting it *in context*. They don't get the stakes here. And I mean if it *did* all come out... oh man. And I mean the stories they are telling, it couldn't be true, right? They are saying your friend lied, that he has done this before, that he actually lied *to you* and that he never cared about the promises he made to help you buy a new Mustang from a great buddy of his that would give you the best discount. I mean, if *that* were true, maybe he lied to you about everything else... maybe everything you did was for nothing, maybe it was all a big lie, maybe *your friend* that you *defended* was pulling one over on *you*... but that... no, that couldn't be. It must be the police. They're framing you *and* your buddy, so you gotta set the record straight, just like your buddy said. You gotta start planting evidence to *prove* who the *real* enemy is.\n\nAnd so it goes until finally you can't rationalize it away anymore, until the evidence so apparent, the consequences so unavoidable, that all the lies you've told yourself, all the lies you've been told, come collapsing down around you all at once and you are left to wrestle with the awful truth of what happened. That is what I imagine it is going to be like for Trump supporters once the tide finally turns. I do not envy them. It won't be pretty. \n",
