The intel was believed to be credible enough that they briefed OBAMA and TRUMP on it. That's not gonna happen if it's a wild fantasy.\n\n2. The FBI applied for FOUR FISA wire tap warrants for Trump advisees/campaign staff during the election. Also doesn't happen if there isn't at least something credible there. That the FISA court turned down the warrants is shocking (99% approval), but I have a sense there is more coming.\n\n\nStrap in folks, this is gonna get bumpy",

Someone from way back talked about how Trump would be an ideal asset for a hostile foreign power: he's contemptuous of the current administration, he has access to money and resources, he's selfish and has no sense of civic duty, he has unsavory appetites that make him easy to blackmail, he's generally stupid and easy to manipulate, and he's drowning in debts that can be leveraged against him.

    "body": "Summary I came up with:\n\n*Of the Buzzfeed dossier. As of yet, unverified -- but I would trust the reporting rolling in from reputable sources, [namely CNN:] (http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/10/politics/donald-trump-intelligence-report-russia/index.html) The Russians have attempted over a long period of time to compromise Trump with damaging financial and personal info. They obtained info on this operation from an ex-MI6 agent with connections in Russia and Europe. Intelligence pared the raw data they got from the agent down to a two-page dossier that was given to POTUS, PEOTUS, and the \"Gang of 8\" select members of Congress. \n\n>8+ years of communication between him and Kremlin, and 5+ year relationship of cultivating/supporting/assisting Trump by Russia.\n \n>They offered him real estate deals IN RUSSIA to further ensnare him, but he declined.\n \n>Russia has dirt on Trump hiring Russian prostitutes give golden showers to each other while he watched, supposedly in the room that was bugged with mics and cameras to record the event.\n\n>**Several users mentioned that we should shift focus away from this, funny as the allegation may be, towards what really matters in this story. The allegations of bribery/blackmail/collusion with a hostile power are what have real teeth here, and what would be most damning claims if proven true. If anyone asks, I would describe those as the meat of the story in order to keep it serious instead of opening with a pee joke or something. But this is just their opinion, and I tend to agree.**\n\n>Detailed claims of bilateral intelligence sharing back and forth between Trump and Putin. Trump had DNC moles and used US as well as foreign hackers. Trump got info on his opponents, Putin got info on Russian oligarchs + families living in US.\n\n>They used the pension system that Russian diplomats used to transfer information back and forth to/from each other as well. It mentions tens of thousands of dollars were sent in addition to the money.\n \n>Russia's main goal appears to be driving wedges to cause divisions in the West. They aided Jill Stein, Carter Page and Michael Flynn (the latter two being members of Trump's team) in doing so. \n \n>Main goal of DNC emails appeared to be swinging Sanders voters to Trump.\n\n>Russia and Trump had a mutual agreement on the DNC hack. Russia released the emails to Wikileaks in return for Trump removing mention of Russian invasion of Crimea in favor of talking about NATO financial commitments in Eastern Europe and the Baltics. Putin wanted people to stop talking Ukraine while also undermining NATO.\n\n>Trump's most damning financial commitments are actually in China and other emerging markets. He's paid large bribes and kickbacks there that would've destroyed his campaign if made public.\n\n>Hilariously, when Trump said he had few Russian financial investments, that was true, but he has actively sought them out only to be denied. He apparently settled for extensive sexual favors there instead\n \n>Trump lawyer Cohen had clandestine meeting with Kremlin operatives in August, held in Prague to try to make it seem less suspicious.\n \n>Ukrainian President that Putin installed confided to Putin he DID provide ex-campaign manager Manafort w/ kickbacks that were previously reported. Left no paper trail.\n \n>Russia pissed this has gotten so much media coverage. They hoped to push for improved Russian-US relationships regardless of who was elected. Ancillary goal with Clinton was to drive her positions further from Obama's in event she won - they're happy both candidates were anti-TPP because they viewed that as bad for them.\n \n>Trump has bribed Russian business interests but worked diligently to obfuscate and eliminate paper trail. Also engaged in Russian sex parties but has likewise bribed or coerced witnesses to be silent. They do believe a particular Russian businessman was intricately linked to Trump would know details.\n \n>Manafort/Page/Cohen all highly compromised. They/Trump were apparently offered up to 19% stake in Russian STATE-OWNED oil company Rosneft by its president if they could successfully get Western Russian sanctions lifted. Page expressed interest in this deal, saying sanctions would be lifted.\n \n>Once the sh*t started to hit the fan, Cohen was heavily involved in trying to cover up the relationship between Carter/Manafort/himself and Russia.\n\n>Mentions that the Trump team AND Russia both paid Romanian hackers to help sabotage Democrats.\n \n>Overall goal of electing Trump was to destabilize Western and world order in Russia's favor since he was anti-establishment and so divisive.\n\nI feel it pertinent to mention that CNN mentioned when this broke that the Buzzfeed story and intel therein ARE unverified, BUT US intel officials consider both the ex-MI6 agent source and his Russian sources credible. I'm guessing our intelligence is working to verify or disprove this now, since Comey would not answer when asked if the FBI was currently investigating Russia-campaign connections on Capital hill today.\n\nLet me know if something needs added or if I screwed something up. \n\nAdditions: Damn, this thing grew into a team effort. Thanks to everybody who put in work.\n\n[Excellent post] (https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/5n8z88/megathread_intelligence_report_claims_russia_has/dc9lwcx/) from u/aubonpaine with loads of sources about more details on everything, notably that Roger Stone was also a point man for Assange.\n\nTwitter user @chris_ baugh_ put together [a great timeline] (https://twitter.com/chris_baugh_/status/818998378285580292) that ties everything together.\n\nu/JustDandy07 is the man. Added a bunch of stuff.\n\nu/whiskystoned, u/sylviecerise and u/TyrionLan1ster made sure I had my TPP bit correct - Russia was AGAINST TPP.\n\nu/Adrian_Bock raised a great point. Trump specifically used Presidential Suite in Russian Ritz-Carlton where Obama/Michelle stayed for his golden shower episode(s) to defile the bed. That's some depraved shit.\n\nu/niknight_ml mentioned that Trump may have helped actually fund the DNC hack itself.\n\nu/pollo_bueno reminded me Rosneft is Russian Government-owned oil.\n\nEdit: Very worthwhile post from u/RedditDawson\n\n>Worth mentioning:\n\n>Trump supporters are brigading this thread claiming it's all a 4chan troll. There's no proof 4chan is behind this.\n\n>4chan user claims to have been sending info to US official as the source for this document\n\n>(Rick Wilson whom they are saying they sent it to is denying he is the source or the /pol/ had anything to do with it).\n\n>https://twitter.com/TheRickWilson/status/819000073853997056\n\n>And now there are many Photoshopped screencaps from the document with outrageous scenarios in attempt to discredit the original\n\nLastly, if you care about investigating this, I'd urge you to call your Senators and ask them to support [Senate Bill 27] (https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-bill/27?r=1), which calls for the establishment of an independent panel to investigate Russia's cyberattacks. McConnell seems completely feckless in this regard and we've all seen the way Congressional investigations can go. I personally feel a non-partisan panel would be the best option.

I don't care if you think this is all liberal lies - a president must deal with issues such as this in an open manner.\n\n2) If these are true... well let's just say that people have protested over a lot less... seriously.... this is \"occupy DC until we get some fucking answers\" level shit.\n\nEdit: for those looking for a bit more grounding I would read [this lawfare article](https://lawfareblog.com/about-explosive-trump-story-take-deep-breath) - it's pretty short but the tl;dr is: these documents have been floating around for a while, they are unsubstantiated, **but** there is a lot of hard facts in there that are presumably not impossible to confirm or deny.  In my mind the president is sort of obligated to prove that at least some parts of this are 100% not true if Trump wants us to ultimately believe him - which should be pretty fucking easy for him to do.\n\nEdit 2: Except for some alarming langauge that seems to suggest he may try to purge the intelligence community, I think this press conference has (for the most part) satisifed my #1 so pitchforks down I guess - as long as he doesn't squash further investigations in Russia, I'm generally satisfied with waiting for confirmation of these claims.",

They were looking at Trump's business ties. They saw some questionable things about Russians, about his businesses in Russia. They, in turn, hired this MI-6 former investigator. He then came up with additional information from his Russian sources. He was very concerned by the implications of it. He then took it to an FBI colleague that he had known in his undercover work for years. He took it to this FBI man in Rome who turned it over to the bureau in Washington in August. And then a former British ambassador to Russia, independently, was made aware of these findings and he took the information to John McCain, Senator John McCain of Arizona, in the period just after the election, and showed it to McCain -- additional findings. McCain was sufficiently disturbed by what he read, to take it to FBI Director James Comey himself personally. They had a five-minute meeting. The two men, very little was said. McCain turned it over to him and is now awaiting what the FBI\u2019s response is to that information. \u200b\n\nDossier: https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3259984-Trump-Intelligence-Allegations.html\n\nOriginal CNN story: http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/10/politics/donald-trump-intelligence-report-russia/\n\nOriginal The Guardian story: https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/10/fbi-chief-given-dossier-by-john-mccain-alleging-secret-trump-russia-contacts?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other\n",

In return the TRUMP team had agreed to sideline Russian intervention in Ukraine as a campaign issue and to raise US/NATO defence commitments in the Baltics and Eastern Europe to deflect attention away from Ukraine, a priority for PUTIN who needed to cauterise the subject\n\nALSO\n\n> Speaking separately, also in early August 2016, a Kremlin official official involved in US relations commented on aspects of the Russian operation to date. Its goals had been threefold - asking sympathetic US actors how Moscow could help them; gathering relevant intelligence; and creating and disseminating compromising information ('kompromat'). **This had involved the Kremlin supporting various US political figures**, including funding indirectly their recent visits to Moscow. S/he named a delegation from Lyndon LAROUCHE; **presidential candidate Jill STEIN of the Green Party; TRUMP foreign policy adviser Carter PAGE; and former DIA Director Michael Flynn**, in this regard and as successful in terms of perceived outcomes. \n\nALSO\n\nre Manafort resignation:\n\n> [...] ex-President YANUKOVYCH of Ukraine[...] had confided in PUTIN That he did **authorise and order substantial kick-back payments to MANAFORT** as alleged but sought to reassure him that there was no documentary trail left behind which could provide clear evidence of this",

This [Rex Tillerson Research Document](http://riggedcabinet.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Rex-Tillerson-Research-Report.pdf) goes into depth on their decades long relationship. Here's some highlights:\n\n* 2011: Under Rex TILLERSON, ExxonMobil Reached An Agreement With State-Owned Russian Oil Company ROSNEFT\nTo Develop Hydrocarbon Resources In The Black Sea. \n\n> The Exxon-ROSNEFT agreement commits Exxon to\nspend about $1 billion looking for oil off Russia\u2019s Black Sea coast, and holds the promise of sharing in the prize if it is\ndiscovered.\n\n* August 2011: Exxon And ROSNEFT Entered Into A Wide-Reaching \u201cStrategic Cooperation Agreement\u201d Under Which\nThe Companies Would Undertake Joint Exploration And Development Projects Throughout The World. \n\n> ROSNEFT and ExxonMobil have executed a Strategic Cooperation Agreement under which the companies\nplan to undertake joint exploration and development of hydrocarbon resources in Russia, the United States and other\ncountries throughout the world, and commence technology and expertise sharing activities. \n\n* In 2011, TILLERSON Struck A Deal With ROSNEFT, Hailed By PUTIN Ally Igor SECHIN And Chairman Of ROSNEFT As A\n\u201cGiant Leap Forward\u2026 More Ambitious Than Man's First Walk In Space Or Sending A Man To The Moon.\u201d\n\n> TILLERSON's biggest deal in Russia was announced in 2011 with ROSNEFT. The companies were focused on\ndrilling for oil in three key Russian regions: the Arctic, the deepwaters of the Black Sea, and Siberia.\n\n> **Before It Was Blocked By Sanctions, Vladimir PUTIN Called The ROSNEFT Deal \u201cOne Of The Most Important\nInvolving Russia And The U.S.,\u201d Forecasting It Could Generate $500 Billion.**\n\n* Rex TILLERSON And Vladimir PUTIN Met In Sochi To Announce $3.2 Billion Investment By Exxon And Russia\u2019s\nROSNEFT To Drill In The Arctic Kara Sea, With Possible Future Investment Reaching $500 Billion.\n\n> ROSNEFT CEO Igor SECHIN On Expansion Of Exxon-ROSNEFT Strategic Cooperation Agreement: \u201cThe Agreements\nSigned Today Bring The Already Unprecedented Scale Of The ROSNEFT And Exxonmobil Partnership Up To A\nCompletely New Level.\u201d\n\n* 2014: Exxon Signed An Agreement With Igor I. SECHIN, Head Of Russian State Oil Company ROSNEFT, Weeks **After**\nThe U.S. Imposed Sanctions On SECHIN.\n\n\nTILLERSON routinely met with PUTIN and SECHIN, the head of Russia\u2019s state-owned oil company ROSNEFT, even after SECHIN\nwas hit with U.S. government sanctions. Along with PUTIN and SECHIN, TILLERSON orchestrated multiple billion dollar deals\nto collaborate with the state-owned company on drilling operations in Russia and the United States. Joint operations in\nRussia have benefited the Russian Government to the tune of tens of billions of dollars. In one instance, a $1 billion\ninvestment by Exxon in ROSNEFT oil holdings in the Black Sea boosted ROSNEFT\u2019s valuation by $7 billion. \n\n___\n\nFrom the [dossier](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3259984-Trump-Intelligence-Allegations.html):\n\n1. Speaking in July 2016, a Russian source close to ROSNEFT President, PUTIN close associate and US-sanctioned individual, Igor SECHIN, confided the details of a recent secret meeting between him and visiting Foreign Affairs Advisor to Republican presidential candidate Donald TRUMP, Carter PAGE.\n\n2. According to SECHIN's associate, the ROSNEFT President (CEO) had raised with PAGE the issues of future bilateral energy cooperation and prospects for an associated move to lift Ukraine-related western sanctions against Russia. PAGE had reacted positively to this demarche by SECHIN but had been generally non-committal in response.\n\n3. In terms of the substance of their discussion, SECHIN's associate said that the ROSNEFT\nPresident was so keen to lift personal and corporate western sanctions imposed on the\ncompany, that **he offered PAGE/TRUMP associates the brokerage of up to a 19 per cent\n(privatised) stake in ROSNEFT in return.** PAGE had expressed interest and confirmed that were TRUMP elected US president, then sanctions on Russia would be lifted.\n\n____\n\nHis conformation for Secretary of State is tomorrow at the exact same time as Trump's press conference.

Apparently, BuzzFeed only recently got wind of this and decided to release the documents.\n\nThis forced CNN to immediately bring to light their own investigation. CNN is not giving any credibility to the 35 page documents, but are admitting they found some of this information based on their investigation.\n\nhttp://www.cnn.com/2017/01/10/politics/donald-trump-intelligence-report-russia/\n\n> CNN has reviewed a 35-page compilation of the memos, from which the two-page synopsis was drawn. The memos have\u00a0since been published by Buzzfeed, but CNN has not reported their contents. The memos originated as opposition research, first commissioned by anti-Trump Republicans, and later by Democrats. At this point, CNN is not reporting on details of the memos, as it has not independently corroborated the specific allegations.\u00a0\n\nSo this is what's going to happen. Trump, his aides, and all his internet supporters are only going to discuss the BuzzFeed information (which I suspect is a mix of truth and fiction) because of how wild some of its accusations are while the actual investigative journalism done by CNN will get buried.\n\nEdit: Sources\n\nEdit2: Jake Tapper calling out BuzzFeed for \"irresponsible\" journalism.\n\n https://twitter.com/jaketapper/status/819190871551864832",

Russia released the emails to Wikileaks in return for Trump removing mention of Russian invasion of Crimea in favor of talking about NATO financial commitments in Eastern Europe and the Baltics. Putin wanted people to stop talking Ukraine while also undermining NATO.\n\nTrump's most damning financial commitments are actually in China and other emerging markets. He's paid large bribes and kickbacks there that would've destroyed his campaign if made public.\n\nHilariously, when Trump said he had few Russian financial investments, that was true, but he has actively sought them out only to be denied.
