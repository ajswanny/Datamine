By effective, I mean  getting policies passed, but they do not have to be necessarily good. \n\nFor example, Bush and the Republican Congress were \"effective\" leaders. They got shit done, but not necessarily strengthening or helping America. \n\nPlus, I like to expose what modern day conservatism is all about: Being a whiny little bitch who caters to racists, bigots, and sexual offenders. And then being a whiny little some more. And on top of that, being a pathological and monumental liar. \n\nGetting back to my original point, the only thing saving America is Trump's GOP's sheer incompetence and impotence. \n\nI hope Trump continues to be incompetent, expose Republicans for what they truly are, and I hope Dems gain more power in 2018 and bitch slap him in 2020.\n\nI don't support impeachment right now. There are no legal grounds and (in an odd way) it is good for people to experience how fucking backwards conservatism truly is. ",

For example, when I was in grad school 12 years ago, we were assigned to observe middle school classes.  It was a 7th grade science class, and I was floored watching a gloriously out and proud young man being 100% himself, surrounded by a variety of personalities.  And I thought back to a boy I knew in 7th grade, who we all knew was gay.  But it was something forbidden to talk about.  He committed suicide in high school because he couldn't be himself.  It's been nothing but wonderful to see these social issues change.  GenX started it, but you guys are going to be the ones who make it a full reality.  ",

Blaming voters is part of it but it's largely punching down and blaming victims of a corrupt, rotted and vile political and economic system that *all of us* have allowed to exist as it is for far too long. We're talking about the electoral college, Citizens United, gerrymandering in Congressional races, voter suppression, the need to restoring the right to vote to ex-felons and prisoners alike, our education system, our brutal economic system. The fact that we've never come close to righting the very serious wrongs of this country surrounding racism, police misconduct, the behavior of Wall Street/Corporate Criminals, etc. All of these things have something to do with how we got here.\n\nTrump didn't come out of nowhere and the 62 million weren't the majority of people who voted. So, we have **many** miles to go before we sleep. Trump resigning today would solve a very small fraction of the issues we have in this shithole of a country. If we do nothing to address the *structural* issues we have, we'll get another Trump before long and if that person is a smarter version of Trump who knows how to play the political game there won't be a single shred of hope that person doesn't serve out a full term. None. \n\nIt's why it's vitally important to constantly demand more/better and not brush off those demands as \"not pragmatic\" just because it's \"your\" team in power at the time. Fuck that. Complacency is also part of how we got here. You never ever should get that way with power. There is always more they could be doing for the people and we should be demanding it relentlessly.",

Also partly why most of the presidents before the civil war were from the south. \n\nWith that said, there were undoubtedly other factors involved, such as the founding fathers not completely trusting direct democracy. However, one thing the electoral college is not is a system that ensures that small states get more representation. In fact political minorities get their vote drowned out in all states in the electoral college system, and candidates also end up focusing on a handful of states that happen to have enough electoral votes to be relevant and divided enough that their presence can sway the outcome.

The vast majority of people--and I'm not even talking politics here--are decent people, with one or two flaws that are disturbingly immoral.  Like George is a great guy, plows your driveway every winter while refusing pay, always helps you move, racially etc tolerant, etc, but he cheats on his wife.  Or Sally is a great woman, volunteers, takes in abandoned pets, great conversationalist, gives to charity but thinks Muslims are trying to enact sharia law in the US, which is horrendously intolerant.\n\nThis applies to the majority of people.  \n\nI think the problem with that comment is that these conservatives don't *believe* they are blowing up their country. They *are* destroying their country, but they honest to god think that anything the democrats support is destroying america, so they will go with anything Trump says because it's better to the alternative. They think Democrats are trying to turn the US into a communist state exactly like the USSR.  \n\nThese people can be great people, but the brainwashing from fox news, brietbart, etc, gave them a mental block that made them very bad people--but only in regards to politics, and ultimately destructive to American democracy itself.\n\nIt's the reason why even though you love your aunts and uncles, you *never* bring up politics on Thanksgiving.",

Republicans know that their current strategy, of courting the billionaire class and convincing uneducated evangelicals to vote against their interests using Biblical moralizing and veiled racism, will never be able to penetrate these urban strongholds. Eliminating the electoral college, and thereby freeing the DNC to double down on those three plus the other major cities where they are strong like Memphis, the Orlando/Miami corridor, New Orleans, the Philadelphia/Pittsburgh corridor, etc., they will never win again.

Does the question allow you to disapprove or does it ask you if you approve of his performance on a 1-10 scale? For the former (yes or no) is a good indicator. for the latter, a scale would imply that 1 means you slightly approve and 10 means you highly approve.\n\n What kind of people are taking the poll? (Is the pool of people more or less politically biased. i.e. are the polls collected in mostly republican areas?)\n\nSecondly he got 62.5 million popular votes out of a population around 320 million people.  to simplify the numbers that 6/30 or roughly 1/5 people voted for him.  thats 20% at best (with rounding).  So unless he gained another 13% of the population to support him (which i doubt) there is no way he has 1/3 americans supporting him.  He has, if anything, lost supporters and when only 1/5 voted for him.  \n\nnot to mention that the 20% that voted for him are mostly life long republican voters. not all of them are racist bigots but he has allowed the ones who are to become more vocal.  and as the saying goes The squeaky wheel gets the oil.

The Russian military while underfunded and under supplies are still really really good at what they do. Until Trump even the far right is knew that. \n\nNow we have people in this country that are on the right, traditionally the ones alstrong on Russia, thinking they're good and the far left that used to traditionally at least tacitly support them are screaming how bad this is.\n\nThe biggest part I don't get is this is an attack on our most fundamental and closely held institution, our democracy, and the party that's supposed to be strong on national security looks the other way.
