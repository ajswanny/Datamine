There\u2019s been a considerable decline in the number of Americans who strongly approve of Trump, from a peak of around 30 percent in February to just 21 or 22 percent of the electorate now. (The decline in Trump\u2019s strong approval ratings is larger than the overall decline in his approval ratings, in fact.) Far from having unconditional love from his base, Trump has already lost almost a third of his strong support. And voters who strongly disapprove of Trump outnumber those who strongly approve of him by about a 2-to-1 ratio, which could presage an \u201centhusiasm gap\u201d that works against Trump at the midterms. The data suggests, in particular, that the GOP\u2019s initial attempt (and failure) in March to pass its unpopular health care bill may have cost Trump with his core supporters.\n\n[And that's from polling done before May 24,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/donald-trumps-base-is-shrinking/) a period where he was quiet on Twitter and out of the country, so it doesn't take into account recent news like pulling out of the Paris Climate Accords, the backlash against his London tweets, the backlash against his \"travel ban\" tweets, the NATO speech, the increased scrutiny on his golfing vacations and now privatizing air traffic control.

This is what 200 years of First Past The Past gets you. This is not about Trump or even solely about Republicans. This mess is about Two Party System and both RNC and DNC being unwilling to do the necessary electoral reforms to unlock the grid lock created by the First Past The Post election system and the two party system it has created. Simply put both RNC and DNC are putting their own political position over the good of the USA and have been doing so for decades.\n\nSimply put having only two options is not sustainable for country of 300 million. There is dozens of political ideologues and groups and schools of thought in USA, but only two get represented. That leads to polarization, not because Americans are polarized, but because the election system only allows two options, so it creates artificial black and white situations.\n\nAlso not being able to vote out either party from the position of two major parties, means that both parties are free to get as corrupt as they want with out consequences. This has been going on since atleast 1800's and robber baron's of the time buying both parties. So essentially nothing has changed in like a century in base problems of USA politics.\n\nTrump is a sympton of a much deeper problem and not a real cause of problems. Fix the deeper problems and the Trumps of USA politics will go away. Don't fix them and from now on you will have a steady frequent supply of Trumps. Not as Trump himself, but as similar persons. Populist demiqoques who take advantage of the problems of two party system  (and the populations very justified anger over the political problems) by setting themselves up as an outsider and promising to \"fix the system\".\n\nUntil problems are solved, who ever sets themselves up as the \"outsider\" will win, since there really is big problems with all of the establishment politicians. On both RNC and DNC.",

If they believe the science, they fail their God. \n\n2) It creates a black/white, good/evil choice for them. A 2-party system exacerbates this. In a Democrat/Republican election, they'll see one as good and one as evil. \n\n3) Because of moral absolutism and simplification of answers to black/white, issues like abortion and gay marriage become absolutes. If you are anti-abortion and anti-gay marriage, you'll automatically get many people's vote regardless of how terrible you are as a person. \n\n4) If they're wrong about any of this, they just have to ask for forgiveness.

I know this bc I watch Fox News every night. I watch it for as long as I can. \n\nWhat I find most dangerous is the egregious lack of objectivity. There won't be one segment on the channel that isn't delivered to the audience without being led and instructed exactly how to think and why to think a certain way about this. \n\nOne of the other things they do which, again all my opinion (as someone that fucking went to medical school), is to demonstrate to their viewers what they're being told is clearly the only answer - they season the last few sentences with a very dismissive condescending tone, implying obviously the liberals are totally wrong and stupid. But you're not stupid, that's why you get it! \n\nIt's a perfect paradigm to effectively cauterize your base. Tell them their esoteric understanding that just so many liberals and elites don't get because they aren't in real America. This allows that Fox News viewer to be as dismissive to everything and everyone that goes against their beliefs. And because they know they're clever and just get what you don't, there's no chance in them changing positions or allowing new evidence in. \n\nIt attracts the kind of viewer that wants to be told they're right. The smallest minds I know lack self criticism. They lack foresight. They lack humility. \n\nI may be wrong about everything I believe. When new data etc come across, we may need to adjust ourselves. \n\nSomewhere in there, Fox News has made their viewers feel they're being insulted and everything insults them. It's this strange entitlement that's been tattooed in the mind. It's a brilliant play too because it reinforces a huge us vs them mentality which lends itself to further disparity politically and prevents genuine honest discourse from happening. \n\nIf you feel entitled, you quickly use the why do they get x but I don't ? From the gop perspective this is wonderful because it closes off middle ground and reaching across the aisle. The topic is so polarized, and the conservative so emotionally upset and insulted by blacks paying very little for their subsidized healthcare, that what we don't hear from that discussions is I'd like subsidized healthcare too. \n\nWe all would. It's really really common sense. Yet that's pushed to the side bc blacks get it cheap. They focus on that point. They get insulted the dirty blacks get more from the govt than them. \n\nNow, further govt hate by the right. It's a remarkable feat, watching this propaganda unfold to get to where we are now. It's to stifle open mindedness, seemingly easy to do against the insecure and entitled. It may be chicken or egg; I don't know anyone that watches Fox News that doesn't think they're wrong - ever. ",

But as long as Trump's base hasn't abandoned him (which so far it hasn't, he's still incredibly popular among Republican voters), there's simply no way they get to 67 votes in the Senate. In the current political climate, it would be political suicide for any Republican Senator to vote in favor of Trump' impeachment. \n\nImpeaching Trump but failing to remove him would cause a huge backlash among Democratic voters.

It also talks about \"testing God\" which in context means questioning the way things have always been done in order to find out the truth.  Core Christianity doesn't see a disagreement between Christ and science.

To my understanding of conservative cognition, a major issue is conservatives do not like nuances or gray areas, and they need for things to make sense and fit into black and white patterns. \n\nThis leads to simplistic 'conservative good liberal bad' cognition, because it is an easy mentality with no gray areas. Plus when you throw facts at them the facts bounce off because their goal with cognition or news is not to become educated or have an authentic understanding of the outside world, it is to maintain a cognition framework that makes them feel safe I'm a hostile world and that makes sense to them and solidifies in group and out group identities. \n\nSo education won't fix this. These people don't value facts or knowledge, they value having a cognitive framework that is simple with clear black and white lines that makes them feel safe in a confusing, hostile world and lets them feel they are the good guys. Their minds are like a house of cards in a strong wind, they don't care about facts, they care about not letting the house of cards fall down. They will invent and ignore facts as needed to maintain the integrity of their mental framework that they need to feel safe, to feel the world makes sense, and that their sense of identity is tied into. \n\nYou can't take people like that and give them more education. If anything that backfires. Studies have shown smarter, more educated conservatives are more deluded and misinformed because they can find ways to delude themselves better.  If you make conservatives smarter or more educated, all that happens is they become better at deluding themselves and each other. ",

I'm not sure how much blame Obama deserves for that; I think you could argue that the Democrats as a whole haven't done a good enough job competing over the past several years, but for the subset of the populace that deep down seethed over being led by a black man, I'm not sure the Dems could have done anything that would have made a difference.\n\nIn short, Obama's legacy isn't going to be diminished by how much of it Trump tries to repeal.

Similarly, the military is horrified by Trump's conflict-baiting, and frustrated by his inattention to strategy. Very different from the military-industrial confabulation of the Bush years. Commercial private-sector industry MIGHT be into him, if it weren't for the fact that his volatility makes designing any kind of long-term market strategy risky in the utmost, and he's alienated enormously powerful industry players already.

The former, i dont know that it changes the civilian casuaties all that much. the later puts american troops at greater risk and greatly increases costs, and again inst a guarantee of reducing civilian casualties as we have seen with some of the boots on the ground raids since trump took office.\n\ni feel like the drone program gets a worse rap than it should in general. the drone program is likely a large part of why there was such a drastic drop in troop deaths during Obamas tenure. There really isnt a good comparison for drone use by other presidents, because the technology really blossomed during Obama. maybe we need better policies on their use and operation, but i dont think the alternatives were better by any means, and their negatives are arguably worse.
