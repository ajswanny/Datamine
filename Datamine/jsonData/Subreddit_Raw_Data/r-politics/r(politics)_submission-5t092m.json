    "body": "It's astonishing to watch the standards we have strived to set for our leaders diminish so rapidly. People mock this, but the reality is that this degrades our institutions, badly. It lowers the bar. It makes this and even worse acceptable over time. People laugh at this, but they aren't shocked by it. We should be shocked by it. And again, the blame in my mind lies almost entirely with GOP leadership.\n\nOne of the things I've taken away from this election the most is that party leadership matters so much, and that the advancement of craven, immoral people to the leadership of Republican ranks has been absolutely poisonous to this country.\n\nThe key thing here is that most people do not care about most issues. They really don't. Most people don't feel that strongly about, well, anything. Especially abstract policies or generic \"corruption\" which doesn't personally effect them. This is a problem with democracy, because you're asking people to make decisions based on issues they neither pay attention to, nor care about. In order for this system to work, the people in charge need to guide their constituencies in good directions. Leadership is not a one way thing - it's not like people say \"we like X\" and their elected officials just do it.\n\nIf you had gone back a few years, and asked most Republicans whether they wanted a President who was trying to personally profit off the Presidency, everyone would have said no. And if the GOP leadership - united - says \"this is wrong and unacceptable and the President needs to stop\" it would matter. It would signal to other Republicans that its ok to oppose this kind of stuff.\n\nBut the GOP doesn't do it. Either because they are cowed or craven, or because they hate Democrats more than they cared about these principles, they don't do it. And so their base has absolutely no sense that this is bad - it's just another partisan fight. There's no unified, independent sense of \"this is wrong independent of party\". And so even stuff like torture or corruption has really turned into partisanship - Republicans hate corruption by Democrats, don't give a shit about it when the GOP President is astonishingly, brazely, corrupt.\n\nIt's not enough to represent people. You need to have some semblance of moral courage. In order for a country to become evil or corrupt, the people don't need to be evil or corrupt. They just need to be indifferent enough to *let* an evil or corrupt person get in charge. We're doing that now. And our institutions are going to die on the vine.",

Trump supporters would not take kindly to the Republican leadership censuring Trump on this stuff. \n\nI think most of his supporters understand this sort of thing just fine.

What Trump opponents need to understand is that the ideology of the Trump movement basically boils down to \"what can we get away with?\" They're fine with the corruption and would welcome a fight over it, because it would provide yet another opportunity for Trump to \"win\" by facing no consequences even as everyone rages against him. \n\n>In order for a country to become evil or corrupt, the people don't need to be evil or corrupt. They just need to be indifferent enough to let an evil or corrupt person get in charge\n\nYou're right about that, but the fact is that there are far more of the people who are \"evil and corrupt\" than you may like to think, and they are pushing this hard from the bottom up.\n",

It wants to you believe that no government can do any good, nothing constructive, and certainly will not take action without having the ability to point to a party donor and the benefit they will directly receive.\n\nIt wants that because that is how the GOP gets all the power. And power is the only thing the GOP wants. Don't ask for a purpose. The purpose is the power itself. It's like what Orwell wrote. All of these actions serve a single drive towards more power. Everything the GOP does, from the cabinet votes, to the EOs, to defunding ACA without replacement is about gathering more and more power for them while taking it away from you.\n\nOur future is dark. I cannot argue otherwise. But resistance is not futile. Orwell did write a single message of hope in 1984. That the proles were the only way to take down Big Brother. And in that, he meant that it was the people who have this ability. However they have to stand united and together. Which is where we see the other tactic of the GOP come into play. Trying to keep divisions alive and pumping.\n\nThat is the purpose of the anti-life groups getting the backing they have in this administration. This is why you see one faith promoted above others. This is the reason you see today's EO granting additional police powers. It is all done to keep us thinking that there is no \"Us\" and only that there is a \"Them\".\n\nThey are the ones protesting.\n\nThey are the ones attacking.\n\nThey are the ones taking our jobs.\n\nIt's all propaganda. And it is all lies.\n\nThe truth is the Women's March scared the absolute shit out of the GOP planners. It showed that there was a united front to this administration which crossed all cultural, political, and class boundaries. The upcoming Science March and Tax March will hopefully do the same.\n\nAnd again, that relies on you. It relies on all of us coming together to make our voices heard.\n\nResist. Peace.",

I start to worry that revolution is brewing. Keep pushing and pushing until just enough people go over the edge, take that as proof that the left is crazy and violent and start adding measures to keep dissent quiet.\n\nHell I wouldn't be surprised if we didn't end up with an Operation Northwoods at some point. Kennedy was the kind of man who would never approve of such a thing, but Trump? If Bannon told him the best way to secure the borders was drop a bomb or two in the right areas with \"Islamist\" evidence sprinkled around it, do you honestly think he'd say no? \n\nImagine Steve Bannon whispering in Trump's ear. \"Donald... you'll be the hero. The saviour they'll all turn to in their hour of fear. They'll cry for forgiveness, for saying you were wrong, and all they want is for you to keep them safe. Bush was hit by 9/11 because he was ignoring intelligence. You tried to secure the borders, you tried to vet entrants more, but those so-called judges... they said you were wrong. After this? No one will ever say you're wrong again, Donald. You'll be the president who had the guts to stand firm, and there won't be one more liberal willing to stand in your way...\"",

Instead, she plays politics just like any other slimy politician and uses trump's own language and political style to try and get the stupidest of his voters. If she wanted to have any influence in politics or be remembered for doing anything useful in government, that ship sailed long ago. At this point, her and most of her party are just a collection of left-wingers who are too angry, disgusted and/or apathetic to actually make any difference in politics whatsoever.",
