    "body": "The takeaway from all of this is that the GOP was so desperate to win, because they cling to antiquated beliefs that a majority of Americans do not support, that they completely sold this country to, at best, a complete moron with no ability to govern and, most likely, an amoral traitor, sexual assaulter, and international con man who is the cock holster for an autocratic dictator.\n\nWe had 8 years of stability, economic growth, progress in providing health care (ironically to many Trumpists), and an increase in the favorability of the USA in international eyes. We were slowly becoming a progressive Western nation on par with the EU. And in less than a year, the GOP has destroyed it all.\n\nThe GOP is, and always will be, the minority party in this country in terms of voter support and popular opinion and so they have increasingly become more corrupt and more illegal in their functioning. \n\nThe takeaway is that Trump is the symptom, not the disease. The GOP must reform.",

Which they will call a Rino because it's a no True Scotsman party at the moment. \n\nPreet Bharara had a [great podcast about Mueller.](http://www.wnyc.org/story/advising-obama-mueller-lisa-monaco/) Now, while both of this individuals are definitively biased, the one thing I can certainly appreciate about their conversational style is that it's very matter of fact and diplomatic, kind of like Fox News but the opposite. They both worked with Mueller and basically say the exact same thing. He's extremely tough and extremely fair. And everyone should *want* him to be the one investigating you. Because if you're not guilty, he'll prove that. If you are, he'll prove that.\n\nThis whole sudden republican hate for Mueller is fucking phenomenal. He's the exact person they'd lick the boots of if he wasn't investigating their glorious leader. He's a war vet with an extremely impressive record and everyone that's met him or worked with him has had nothing but amazing things to say about him. I believe Lisa Monaco remarks that \"with all due respect to President Obama\" the best job she ever had was having a chance to work with Bob Mueller. \n\n----\n\nAs an aside,\n\nPreet himself was in an odd situation, a Democrat appointed New York Attorney General in charge of Trump's district, business wise. Most of the time when administrations change parties, all of the AG's are let go and replaced with AGs from the other party, but Trump asked him specifically to stay on. Trump then began to try to foster a very personal relationship with Preet (it's pretty tacit that AG's and Presidents are not supposed to have conversations). After Preet \"spurned his advances\" so to speak because Trump kept calling him personally *just to chat*, Trump fired him. He covers this in more detail in his first podcast.\n\nHere:\nhttp://www.wnyc.org/story/that-time-president-trump-fired-me-leon-panetta/\n\n",

I'd guess either Manafort or Kushner, maybe both. CNN is saying it's multiple people. More than likely this indictment is going to be used to scare the shit out of whoever's name is in there, and hopefully get them to flip and assist Mueller.\n\nIt's also important what this charge is. It's entirely possible it's a charge completely unrelated to collusion with Russia, but I *highly* doubt it. If it's unrelated, the GOP will be all over it saying that there's nothing there and Mueller's investigation is a farce. We know Bob is smarter than that, so this is probably going to be someone(s) fairly close to the administration.\n\nFlynn is also possible. There has been virtually no news about him lately, so I've wondered if he hasn't already flipped, or Mueller's team is asking news organizations to sit on any Flynn-related news.",
