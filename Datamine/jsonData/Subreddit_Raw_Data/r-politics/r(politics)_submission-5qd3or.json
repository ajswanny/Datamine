I think a lot of us Westerners assume that most politicians, no matter how high up they are have a) some sense of shame and b) some desire for self preservation (financial or otherwise). What scares me about Trump is that he doesn't seem to have either. Most other politicians could be pressured to drop/modify certain positions that are unpopular in order to not be shamed/or lose the next election. With Trump, why does he have to give a fuck? He's shown that he's a Teflon coated rich guy and he's probably too old to want to run after this term. He doesn't care about public opinion and he's got nothing to lose financially or from a power perspective from any of his decisions. That's scary to me. He doesn't have to give a single fuck because not matter what he does, as long as the world isn't a nuclear wasteland after he's done with it, he, his family and their children will be financially OK. \n\nEdit: In other words, as long as his decisions somewhat benefit him and his family, he doesn't have to give a shit...",

Every time you hear \"politicians are all corrupt\" you should be wary of the underlying source and resist blindly parroting it.

Is the US and UK democratic systems perfect? Absolutely not! But they're still vastly preferable to many other governmental systems in the rest of the world and are still fair and open democracies, but it will require vigilance to keep them that way. Letting cynicism get in the way of being proud of the democratic systems in the US and the UK risks their destruction.\n\nRussia doesn't care, they feel immune to specific propaganda back the other way about the openness of their government: if they are accused of not being a free and open democracy they will shrug and not care in a manner similar to Trump's response to being asked to release his tax returns.",

It is an area of Russian language speakers, is separated geographically, and Transnistrians have [called for annexation](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-26627236).\n\nThe catalyst / trigger for the Russian invasion of Ukraine was of course Euromaiden and the feeling they were going to fall behind Europe in influence over Ukraine. To allow Ukraine to forge ahead with closer ties to Europe even after significant Russian pressure would make Russia appear weak.\n\nMoldova actually already has the level of EU integration (association agreement) that Ukraine were trying to ratify and it's not clear what a catalyst might be. There is also a logistic issue that the Transnistrian region does not border Russia, does not border the Black Sea, but instead borders Ukraine (The government controlled West of Ukraine not the Russian controlled East).\n\nNevertheless with the EU distracted by upcoming French, German and Dutch elections and the continuing impact of brexit I would not be surprised if Transnistria is annexed by Russia in 2017. I hope it does not happen but if this happens I hope it happens peacefully and without impacting too heavily the rest of Moldova.",

The US absolutely has moral authority to lecture most of the rest of the world. It still has a functioning democracy, even if that democracy is under threat and is weakened.\n\nIn the UK no party has achieved a majority of the popular vote (at least in recent history). Not achieving a majority of the popular vote is not a sign of a weak or broken democracy. The UK has a full parliamentary democracy by constituency, a majority of which determines the executive rather than the more direct presidential elections that the US has. \n\nThe electoral college does not break or undermine democracy. The electoral system more widely and in particular First Past the Post again do impact the level of democracy and that's why the united states and the united kingdom both rank worse than many other European nations with fairer voting systems.\n\nBut they don't break democracy; democracy is not a binary thing which you either do or do not have. The united states has fair and open elections, it has good transparency of the white house and congress and the justice system. It is generally accountable to the press but that accountability is rapidly disappearing. Another key factor in democracy is an informed and educated electorate. This is something that is also a deep concern.\n\nSo it's not perfect, not even close. It's a wounded democracy but it is a million miles away from the sham democracy in Russia, it is a million miles from the single party state of China.\n\nIt has separation of executive, legislature and judiciary (kinda). The judiciary are politically appointed which limits how separate they tend to act but they are still separate and free to rule against the executive.\n\nIf you declare \"The US is not a democracy\" you are directly contributing to that statement becoming true and I suspect that is something, assuming you are a US citizen and resident, that would live to regret if you were to find out first hand what actually living in \"not a democracy\" really means.",
