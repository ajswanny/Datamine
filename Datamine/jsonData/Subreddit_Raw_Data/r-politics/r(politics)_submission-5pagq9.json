Best case scenario he does something with a conflict of interest with his businesses and presidential powers. Worst case scenario is a fatal foreign policy error. Hypothetically, Trump comes down with an ill advised and heavy handed sanction or foreign policy move on North Korea the next time they do something scary crazy. The paranoid and unstable leadership of North Korea launches artillery at Seoul in response to Trump's threats. He will do something as President that is going to be either highly scandalous or highly fatal. It is only a matter of time with him.

Stop it.\n\nCall him for what he is: a fascist.\n\n#[**The 14 points of Fascism**](http://www.dailykos.com/story/2015/11/20/1452457/-Time-to-pull-out-again-The-14-Points-of-Fascism)\n\n**Powerful and Continuing Nationalism**\n\nFascist regimes tend to make constant use of patriotic mottos, slogans, symbols, songs, and other paraphernalia. Flags are seen everywhere, as are flag symbols on clothing and in public displays.\n\n**Disdain for the Recognition of Human Rights**\n\nBecause of fear of enemies and the need for security, the people in fascist regimes are persuaded that human rights can be ignored in certain cases because of \"need.\" The people tend to look the other way or even approve of torture, summary executions, assassinations, long incarcerations of prisoners, etc.\n\n**Identification of Enemies/Scapegoats as a Unifying Cause**\n\nThe people are rallied into a unifying patriotic frenzy over the need to eliminate a perceived common threat or foe: racial, ethnic or religious minorities; liberals; communists; socialists, terrorists, etc.\n\n**Supremacy of the Military**\n\nEven when there are widespread domestic problems, the military is given a disproportionate amount of government funding, and the domestic agenda is neglected. Soldiers and military service are glamorized.\n\n**Rampant Sexism**\n\nThe governments of fascist nations tend to be almost exclusively male-dominated. Under fascist regimes, traditional gender roles are made more rigid. Opposition to abortion is high, as is homophobia and anti-gay legislation and national policy.\n\n**Controlled Mass Media**\n\nSometimes the media is directly controlled by the government, but in other cases, the media is indirectly controlled by government regulation, or sympathetic media spokespeople and executives. Censorship, especially in war time, is very common.\n\n**Obsession with National Security**\n\nFear is used as a motivational tool by the government over the masses.\n\n**Religion and Government are Intertwined**\n\nGovernments in fascist nations tend to use the most common religion in the nation as a tool to manipulate public opinion. Religious rhetoric and terminology is common from government leaders, even when the major tenets of the religion are diametrically opposed to the government's policies or actions.\n\n**Corporate Power is Protected**\n\nThe industrial and business aristocracy of a fascist nation often are the ones who put the government leaders into power, creating a mutually beneficial business/government relationship and power elite.\n\n**Labor Power is Suppressed**\n\nBecause the organizing power of labor is the only real threat to a fascist government, labor unions are either eliminated entirely, or are severely suppressed.\n\n**Disdain for Intellectuals and the Arts**\n\nFascist nations tend to promote and tolerate open hostility to higher education, and academia. It is not uncommon for professors and other academics to be censored or even arrested. Free expression in the arts is openly attacked, and governments often refuse to fund the arts.\n\n**Obsession with Crime and Punishment**\n\nUnder fascist regimes, the police are given almost limitless power to enforce laws. The people are often willing to overlook police abuses and even forego civil liberties in the name of patriotism. There is often a national police force with virtually unlimited power in fascist nations.\n\n**Rampant Cronyism and Corruption**\n\nFascist regimes almost always are governed by groups of friends and associates who appoint each other to government positions and use governmental power and authority to protect their friends from accountability. It is not uncommon in fascist regimes for national resources and even treasures to be appropriated or even outright stolen by government leaders.\n\n**Fraudulent Elections**\n\nSometimes elections in fascist nations are a complete sham. Other times elections are manipulated by smear campaigns against or even assassination of opposition candidates, use of legislation to control voting numbers or political district boundaries, and manipulation of the media. Fascist nations also typically use their judiciaries to manipulate or control elections.\n\n**EDIT:** if that list by Laurence Britt during the Bush 43 administration doesn't worry you, [check out Umberto Eco's list that he penned in 1995...](http://www.openculture.com/2016/11/umberto-eco-makes-a-list-of-the-14-common-features-of-fascism.html)\n\n***The cult of tradition.***\n\n^\u201cOne ^has ^only ^to ^look ^at ^the ^syllabus ^of ^every ^fascist ^movement ^to ^find ^the ^major ^traditionalist ^thinkers. ^The ^Nazi ^gnosis ^was ^nourished ^by ^traditionalist, ^syncretistic, ^occult ^elements.\u201d\n\n***The rejection of modernism.***\n\n^\u201cThe ^Enlightenment, ^the ^Age ^of ^Reason, ^is ^seen ^as ^the ^beginning ^of ^modern ^depravity. ^In ^this ^sense ^Ur-Fascism ^can ^be ^defined ^as ^irrationalism.\u201d\n\n***The cult of action for action\u2019s sake.***\n\n^\u201cAction ^being ^beautiful ^in ^itself, ^it ^must ^be ^taken ^before, ^or ^without, ^any ^previous ^reflection. ^Thinking ^is ^a ^form ^of ^emasculation.\u201d\n\n***Disagreement is treason.***\n\n^\u201cThe ^critical ^spirit ^makes ^distinctions, ^and ^to ^distinguish ^is ^a ^sign ^of ^modernism. ^In ^modern ^culture ^the ^scientific ^community ^praises ^disagreement ^as ^a ^way ^to ^improve ^knowledge.\u201d\n\n***Fear of difference.***\n\n^\u201cThe ^first ^appeal ^of ^a ^fascist ^or ^prematurely ^fascist ^movement ^is ^an ^appeal ^against ^the ^intruders. ^Thus ^Ur-Fascism ^is ^racist ^by ^definition.\u201d\n\n***Appeal to social frustration.***\n\n^\u201cOne ^of ^the ^most ^typical ^features ^of ^the ^historical ^fascism ^was ^the ^appeal ^to ^a ^frustrated ^middle ^class, ^a ^class ^suffering ^from ^an ^economic ^crisis ^or ^feelings ^of ^political ^humiliation, ^and ^frightened ^by ^the ^pressure ^of ^lower ^social ^groups.\u201d\n\n***The obsession with a plot.***\n\n^\u201cThe ^followers ^must ^feel ^besieged. ^The ^easiest ^way ^to ^solve ^the ^plot ^is ^the ^appeal ^to ^xenophobia.\u201d\n\n***The enemy is both strong and weak.***\n\n^\u201cBy ^a ^continuous ^shifting ^of ^rhetorical ^focus, ^the ^enemies ^are ^at ^the ^same ^time ^too ^strong ^and ^too ^weak.\u201d\n\n***Pacifism is trafficking with the enemy.***\n\n^\u201cFor ^Ur-Fascism ^there ^is ^no ^struggle ^for ^life ^but, ^rather, ^life ^is ^lived ^for ^struggle.\u201d\n\n***Contempt for the weak.***\n\n^\u201cElitism ^is ^a ^typical ^aspect ^of ^any ^reactionary ^ideology.\u201d\n\n***Everybody is educated to become a hero.***\n\n^\u201cIn ^Ur-Fascist ^ideology, ^heroism ^is ^the ^norm. ^This ^cult ^of ^heroism ^is ^strictly ^linked ^with ^the ^cult ^of ^death.\u201d\n\n***Machismo and weaponry.***\n\n^\u201cMachismo ^implies ^both ^disdain ^for ^women ^and ^intolerance ^and ^condemnation ^of ^nonstandard ^sexual ^habits, ^from ^chastity ^to ^homosexuality.\u201d\n\n***Selective populism.***\n\n^\u201cThere ^is ^in ^our ^future ^a ^TV ^or ^Internet ^populism, ^in ^which ^the ^emotional ^response ^of ^a ^selected ^group ^of ^citizens ^can ^be ^presented ^and ^accepted ^as ^the ^Voice ^of ^the ^People.\u201d\n\n***Ur-Fascism speaks Newspeak.***\n\n^\u201cAll ^the ^Nazi ^or ^Fascist ^schoolbooks ^made ^use ^of ^an ^impoverished ^vocabulary, ^and ^an ^elementary ^syntax, ^in ^order ^to ^limit ^the ^instruments ^for ^complex ^and ^critical ^reasoning.\u201d",

It's an insult to our great ape cousins to compare Trump to them.\n\nIn any case, regardless of how fascist he may be, I will never treat him with the respect due a worthy opponent - because he isn't one. He is a man child with less emotional depth and self-control than many teenagers I know. I don't fear him, and I certainly don't respect him. When I see the state of things now, I don't feel hopeless or beaten. I feel angry, and I've already decided that I can't just sit on the sidelines anymore, and hope that people decide to play nice and play fair. Trump is a figurehead, a rubber stamp president, and nothing more. He is a puppet - of Russia, perhaps, but definitely a puppet for the Republican party. And I highly suspect that once he's rubber stamped their radical agendas, they'll dispose of him, because they've definitely learned one lesson: when you need a distraction, you send in the clowns. Once the need for a distraction is over, you send them away, and nobody realizes that you were spending the clowns' time in the spotlight changing the game entirely.\n\nTrump isn't the enemy we need to respect and scrutinize closely. He's a cheap disposable tool. His dangers, while real, are far more limited. He exists solely to make the political environment safe for the radical right's agenda, and to keep the people from looking too closely at that agenda.\n\nGovernments rule only through the consent of the governed. They will try and obscure that fact as much as possible, but it has remained true for all of human history. Fascism is probably the most advanced smokescreen dropped in front of that fact, but even it can't change the fact. We The People still have the power, and we need to organize *now* to make it clear that we do not approve. If they are going to try and push us, we need to stand up and push back. I'm not calling for an armed insurrection here (well, not yet, anyway). I'm calling for the People to stop treating government and politics like a spectator sport. We all need to get involved.",

Want smart guns with biometric locks? then put yourself in the market so that manufacturers will take you seriously. Use the power of the purse for good. I know it sounds ridiculous that you need to buy a gun in order to regulate guns but think of it as being a stockholder with a vote. It's a constitutional amendment and it is not going away so embrace it and shape it to your liking. There is not going to be an America without guns, sorry but time to face that fact, so let us make it an America where all the guns eventually are biometrically locked to their owners who have been background checked a dozen times before taking their firearm home. \n\nI am very liberal but I am also pragmatic.\n\nbesides all that, you might need a gun when your red hat, brown shirt wearing, arm in the air saluting neighbor decides you are a threat to his beloved dear leader",
