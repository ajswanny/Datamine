They regularly provide lodging, food, entertainment all without going through a bidding process. And Trump pockets the taxpayer money.\n\nEdit: A lot of people have asked about cost. [The Secrect Service has so far requested an increase of $60 million dollars in budget](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/secret-service-asked-for-60-million-extra-for-trump-era-travel-and-protection-documents-show/2017/03/22/0967e7b6-0a85-11e7-a15f-a58d4a988474_story.html?utm_term=.030ceb786cf2) because of Trump's travel to his own hotels/restaurants and because his wife and kid refuse to move from New York City to live in the White House. This is just the Secret Service. It does not speak to any other federal employees that have had to travel from DC, the central hub of the federal government, to meet with Trump. This spending and traveling is not normal.",

I'm talking two to three cop cars. Every day. And the cops were standoffish and rude.  \n  \nIn the year that I went to that park, at least once a week to play basketball or skate, there was not one single incident worthy of police presence. No one ever gave me a hard time for being the only white person, *except* for the cops. They wanted to know what I was doing there. Cause I guess if a white person is around black people, they must also be up to no good.  \n  \nThe locals, on the other hand, were awesome. One guy would even ride up to the store and get a bunch of drinks to sell us at a very reasonable markup because the park didn't have a working water fountain.  \n  \nLiving in neighborhoods like that really opened my eyes to the systemic racism that's still alive and well in America today.",

They just didn't plan ahead for the possibility of the president owning the golf course.  There are a lot of assumptions and leeway given to the presidency.  Most laws are generally in place because somebody did it.  I forget where it was, but there is some town where you're not allowed to carry an alligator in your briefcase.  It sounds ridiculous, but they made that a law because some idiot did it, and in court he was able to argue \"well, it's not illegal!\"  So they made it a law.
