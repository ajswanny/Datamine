Which means, if people can start something even vaguely reminiscent of Occupy Wall Street in scale (and with a goal, for chrissakes...) the Democrats will almost certainly adopt it, as a repeal that's supported by 80% of the population would certainly be a plank in their platform. I guarentee the DNC would just all over that in a second, knowing they have the complete backing of 80% of the population on this issue. It would be a shoe-in for their party.

BGPMon recorded two three-minute hijacks, affecting 80 address blocks in total. Qrator Labs said the incident spanned two hours, with the number of address blocks fluctuating between 40 and 80.\n\n> Some reasons for suspicion include the prominence of the impacted companies, and the fact that IP addresses were split into smaller blocks than those announced by the companies \u2014something that doesn't normally happen with a BGP configuration error.\n\n> The autonomous Russian system that performed the hijack, known as AS39523, was previously inactive for years except for another BGP incident in August that involved Google. \n\n> It's unknown what might been done with data if the latest redirect was deliberate, since much or all of it would've been protected by encryption that has yet to be defeated, at least according to public knowledge. An attacker could conceivably have figured out decryption, attempted to crack it, or may be storing the data for future attacks.\n\nI find this very disconcerting, especially occurring on the day that the FCC voted to gut net neutrality, despite the overwhelming support of net neutrality by the vast majority of citizens and corporations.\n\nAnyone know anything else about this?\n\n*An [ArsTechnica article on this.](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/12/suspicious-event-routes-traffic-for-big-name-sites-through-russia/) (Weird that this didn't show up in my google search, huh?)",

And black people voted for Doug Jones, luckily there was a record turnout from Black people because that was the only way Doug Jones won. But with the 2016 elections, white people voted for Trump while the majority of minorities voted for HRC.

Not much to get super excited about election wise\" democrats lose their voting base, then have to start appealing more to moderates to make sure republicans don't take their seats.  Or dems try to *actually* govern and work with their conservative colleagues. Liberals don't like that, \"both sides the same!\" shouted from the rooftops.  voter apathy grows, especially in purple and red states as those from deep blue states really hammer that rhetoric in.  GOP sweep other branches of government. Nothing gets done now, more voter apathy.  GOP takes the presidency while controlling most of the government.  Liberals start freaking out as they realize again both sides aren't the same and the cycle repeats.\n\nGOP has a consistent voting base, that vote no matter how dull or boring the candidate and issue is.  Their biggest worry isn't voter apathy, it's being primaried.\n\nDems really need to figure out how to keep their voters voting consistently, but i think it more will have to be a cultural change amongst liberals feelings on voting and the \"establishment\".  Dems can't be expected to turn out a *Bernie Sanders* for every electable position across the board in order to excite their base to actually turn out for every minor and major election.  But that's going to mean changing the lefts historic views on the \"establishment\".  Because lets be real, all those progressive \"outsiders\" making their way into the party will in 10 years time be the \"establishment\" for the next generation of liberals.",

A \"No\" vote or burying the bill in committee will both be played off as \"gun control\" so the issue just came back up and a \"Yes\" vote alienates other supporters in your own base. You could try to argue \"we just want to keep the status quo for now\"...but I'm not so sure that would work.\n\nI realize this would require the GOP to be proactive and not just stamp their feet or write parts of a bill in cursive 20 minutes before a vote, but I could see them get organized for something like that, if only for the \"haha take that libruls\" factor.",

They're not going to directly do anything that'll cost money (at least not for several years, and probably not even then) because that's the sort of thing that gets people fired up.  It'll probably be more like grandma has a 5 Gb data cap, but Facebook isn't counted towards the cap. That way it sounds purely like a bonus.\n\nEven the big money for ISPs isn't going to be charging consumers, it'll be from charging websites so that their data isn't throttled. This probably won't affect the big services too much (Facebook, Netflix, Hulu, etc) because, again, that'll piss the actual users off. But if some company wants to start a new internet service, they're going to wind up having to pay through the nose in order to have their site be usable (because how many users are going to understand whats happening when a small startup doesn't work too well but all the other big websites seem to work fine?)  This will have the effect of entrenching the current big players while preventing any competition.\n\nIn short, it's not going to be the ISPs who will be raising prices - it'll be the website services, who will have be paying kickbacks to the ISPs so that their sites aren't throttled. Which makes the issue a lot more complicated to explain to people (I wound up explaining to my mom via \"what happens when QVC pays to have HSN's website made unusably slow?\" Yes, she enjoys home shopping  :P )",

They want to push the same bullshit laws they have here which continually put an undue burden on gun owners, and are often made by people [who don't know a damn thing about guns.](https://youtu.be/HI9tov6A2DI) Restrictions are placed on cosmetic features, actual safety devices are made illegal, and misinformation propagation that would make Fox News blush is spread as the norm. And all this in the name of \"public safety\", while they ignore the root causes of the violence that some, (often illegally acquired) guns are used for, and instead push toward making it as obnoxious, difficult, and even embarrassing as possible to own a gun. More conspiracy minded people would even go as far as to say that knowing they can't just get rid of 2A their plan is to make it so legally difficult to get a gun that ownership might as well be illegal.\n\nIf democrats would drop the nonstop attacks on 2A and focus on the poverty and cultural issues that lead to the violence in the first place they'd get a lot more support. Especially from the single issue voters who put 2A above everything else. But no, it's easier to frighten people with the black rifle boogeyman and make a career off that fear. It's the exact same thing the right wing does to convince people that socialized Healthcare means death panels for the elderly and sick or that gay people want to destroy the family structure of the nation and convert conservative children into sex slaves. It's fucking ridiculous, yet the execution is insidious enough that loads of people buy it.\n\nEdit: As an addendum, registration *DOES* lead to confiscation. Look what happened to SKS owners in California. All they have to do after you've registered your gun is later decide that some feature of it (example: detachable magazines) are illegal, and now you're a criminal and they can come to your home without a warrant and demand to take your property, and if you don't comply you're arrested. *This literally happened once already.*\n\nIf you read articles about it when it happened they make it sound like they were taking guns from criminals. Which I suppose they were, *because the criminals they took the guns from were manufactured by the law banning the magazines!* They literally made a law, that overnight turned thousands of people into criminals and went \"Look how many guns we took from criminals! Don't you feel safe now!?\" ",

As if women being gay was taking away more of his \"options\".\n\nThese conservative guys who complain about trans women are angry because it's \"another\" thing to watch out for instead of it being an easy process of find hot girl, fuck hot girl. When I'm out and about I don't worry about if an attractive woman was born a man because I'm relatively fucking normal and it's not a concern.",

Again, when GOP economic policy is accurately explained to voters, they simply cannot believe it's true. nytimes.com/2012/07/08/mag\u2026\n\n>11. Most ppl have other priorities & are woefully ignorant about politics. Research has confirmed this again & again. *Boundless* ignorance.\n\n>12. Average people absorb politics piecemeal, through osmosis. What they generally see is a haze of pettiness, squabbles, & conflict.\n\n>13. Viewed from this distance, most people conclude that \"politics\" is hopeless, all politicians are venal, & the whole game is corrupt.\n\n>14. Unless you're willing to put in serious time & work to suss out the details, \"pox on both houses\" is kind of the default destination.\n\n>15. So when voters are confronted by the idea that one party wants to take from the poor & sick & to fund tax cuts for the rich ...\n\n>16. ... and the other party doesn't, it simply doesn't fit the hazy \"both sides suck\" model. It *sounds* like an unfair partisan attack.\n\n>17. The truth about the GOP sounds like an attack on the GOP, so people dismiss it as such. It is a perverse form of immunity.\n\n...\n\n>27. In this way, the GOP, whether through design or accident, has stumbled on a brilliant political strategy for advancing kleptocracy.\n\n>28. They exploit public & media heuristics that make us highly averse to asymmetry. They exploit the folk wisdom of \"both sides do it.\"\n\n>29. They do their deeds right out in the open, trusting (accurately!) that a good chunk of the public won't believe it is what it is.\n\n>30. Journalists understand the model of \"finding & exposing hidden information\" -- the pre-internet-age core of journalism -- but ...\n\n>31. ... they have not yet solved the dilemma of how to help the public focus on & understand *already public information* that is surrounded...\n\n>32. ... by a fog of misinformation, bull****, and distraction. This ludicrous tax bill is a real-time test case. Can the media convey ...\n\n>33. ... that it really is as cruel & plutocratic as Dem critics are saying it is? Can they convey that the GOP has become something ...\n\n>34. ... more unhinged & venal than even its worst critics charge? I doubt it. I'm not sure there's *any* econ policy that could break through.\n\n>35. Remember: \"respondents simply refused to believe any politician would do such a thing.\" And that's how they get away with it. </fin> \n\nhttps://twitter.com/drvox/status/936687242373865472\n\n",
