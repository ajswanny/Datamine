Same for Graham.\n- they received a tepid assurance and the House declared Martial Law to repeal some rules and fast track the bill\n- Not a single Republican mentioned the CBO score or cared.\n- McConnell was so certain of his victory that he called Pence down.\n- McConnell called Democrats obstructionists for asking bills to be ready and slowing nominations... The man who stopped Merrick Garland for a year and held up Obama noms for years on end.\n- even at just 50 votes needed and with a majority, McConnell still failed.\n- Conservative Dems we're never even in play! Any Congress watchers know that's a pretty crazy thing.\n- McConnell still forced vulnerable Republicans to vote No even after the bill failed, like Heller.\n\n\nThey came at 2 am for your healthcare, fully aware the bill they were passing would be an unmitigated disaster. They shut down proteata, ended town halls, and ignored polls. They risked everything with endless ammunition against the for midterms. Just to do something they KNEW would raise cost and remove people from healthcare.\n\nBut the constituent voice still stopped them.\n\nNot Trump gets a turn.

He is not intimidated by the bullshit slander against him and his party, and he's not afraid to let McConnell know that. Even in defeat, McConnell is demonstrating his cowardice.

He confirmed that Putin/Russia was closely tied to the Trump campaign;\n\nTL;DR - The Magnitsky Act was implemented in 2012 as an anti-corruption measure against Russian Oligarchs, Browder was a key player as a lobbyist for this Act that was essentially sanctions. He operated an investment firm in Russia and he was on a crusade to stop government/business corruption in Russia. His firm was stolen, so he hired a lawyer, Magnitsky, who found a lot more Russian government corruption. Magnitsky, the lawyer Mr. Browder had hired, was imprisoned and tortured to death. A lot of money is now frozen in the west thanks to the Magnitsky Act. Much of it belongs to those very close to Putin and quite possibly his own money too as Browder estimates he is worth approximately $200 Billion. Trump Jr.'s meeting which included Kushner and Manafort had Russian lawyers that have been fighting against the Magnitsky Act. Remember how they claimed they talked to the Russians about adoptions? Well, in retaliation for the passing of the Magnitsky Act the Russian government banned American's from adopting Russian children. \n\nThis is just unreal. More information can be found here; [Here's a written transcript of the testimony](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/07/bill-browders-testimony-to-the-senate-judiciary-committee/534864/), read Browder's opening statement and he will have you hooked. This isn't some spy novel fiction, this is real life and it has happened and is happening. From the article;\n\n>The financier Bill Browder has emerged as an unlikely central player in the ongoing investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 elections. **Sergei Magnitsky, an attorney Browder hired to investigate official corruption, died in Russian custody in 2009. Congress subsequently imposed sanctions on the officials it held responsible for his death, passing the Magnitsky Act in 2012.** Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s government retaliated, among other ways, by suspending American adoptions of Russian children.\n\n>**Natalia Veselnitskaya, the Russian lawyer who secured a meeting with Donald Trump Jr., Jared Kushner, and Paul Manafort, was engaged in a campaign for the repeal of the Magnitsky Act, and raised the subject of adoptions in that meeting. That\u2019s put the spotlight back on Browder\u2019s long campaign for Kremlin accountability, and against corruption\u2014a campaign whose success has irritated Putin and those around him.**\n\n\n\nThe Russian collusion is much bigger than I had previously assumed. It seems to all come back to the [Magnitsky Act](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2017/07/magnitsky-act-kremlin/535044/) which passed under Obama that essentially froze Russian Oligarch money; \n\n> ...freezes certain Russian officials\u2019 access to the stashes they were keeping in Western banks and real estate and bans their entry to the United States. The reason Russian (and now, American) officials keep talking about adoption in the same breath is because of how the Russian side retaliated to the Magnitsky Act in 2012, namely by banning American adoptions of Russian children.

Putin wants that repealed specifically because it makes him weak since his kleptocrats are not happy when they can't keep what they stole. \n\n\nSecond, it means that when Don Jr. tries to brush away the meeting he had by saying it was innocuously a discussion about Americans adopting Russian babies, he's a lying shitcan because the adoption ban was a direct retaliation by Putin for the Magnisky Act.\n\n\nTo me, Browder's testimony is a smoking gun that makes it clear, as if it wasn't already, that Don Jr. was ABSOLUTELY talking about removing sanctions against Russia in exchange for help with opposition research on Clinton, no matter where it came from.\n\n\nIn Trump America, only Trump Americans matter.

This strengthens their overall hand in the 2018 midterms and reduces the already slim chance of them losing control of the senate.

He wanted this BS repeal to fail. But just because he foresaw what happened tonight by initially voting to keep the debate going, people took that as a sign that he was outright lying about everything and proceeded to call him a piece of shit over and over. \n\nSo yeah, apologies are in order, but also, maybe people should at least hold back a little until the pieces fall into place?
