Exxon agreed to a settlement to pay each family who lost their entire livelihood something like $1.4 million, which is fucking weak for an entire commercial fishing career.

Long before that my dad already was in a deep depression, alcoholism, and my mom divorced him. By the time they paid out he didn't live anywhere, traveling around doing nothing, and he split the payout between my brother and I.

I plan on spending my retirement years there.  \n\nEDIT:\n> [Nicaragua is very up on renewable resources:](http://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2015/03/11/392111931/nicaraguas-renewable-energy-revolution-picks-up-steam)\n\n> Nicaragua produces no oil, but is a land of fierce winds, tropical sun and rumbling volcanoes. In other words, it's a renewable energy paradise \u2014 and today the Central American nation is moving quickly to become a green energy powerhouse. Within a few years the vast majority of Nicaragua's electricity will come from hydroelectric dams, geothermal plants and wind farms.\n\nThe reason they didn't join the Paris Climate Accord:\n\n> In the case of Nicaragua, the argument actually went the other way. As world leaders gathered in the French capital in November 2015 to reach an agreement on fighting climate change, Nicaragua's lead envoy explained to reporters that the country would not support the agreed-upon plan as it hinged on voluntary pledges and would not punish those who failed to meet them. That was simply not enough, Paul Oquist argued.\n\n>  \u201cWe\u2019re not going to submit because voluntary responsibility is a path to failure,\u201d Oquist told the website Climate Home on Nov. 30. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to be an accomplice to taking the world to 3 to 4 degrees and the death and destruction that represents.\u201d\n\n",

Time Magazine has a [good article](http://time.com/4799844/nicaragua-paris-climate-agreement-countries/):\n\n\n> Paul Oquist, Nicaragua's representative at the 2015 talks in Paris, has called the climate deal a \"path to failure.\" One of the primary reasons is that **the deal is not binding** \u2014 in other words, **there are no punishments** for countries that fail to live up to the commitments they make as part of the deal [...] Oquist also objected to the agreed-upon goal of **limiting the global temperature increase to 2 degrees Celsius**, noting that the emissions targets, as well as the voluntary nature of the agreement, **would likely result in increases of more like 3 or 4 degrees Celsius** [...] \"It\u2019s a matter of the developing countries surviving. Four degrees is not a survival track in the Sahel with the Sahara advancing. Four degrees is not a survival track for India or Pakistan with the glaciers melting in the Himalayas.

His junta, the Guardia Nacional, tortured and abused the Nicaraguan people for decades before they overthrew him. The Sandinistas were just one faction (admittedly a leftist faction where some members had participated in guerrilla actions against Somozaists), but they were democratically elected by the time Reagan backed the contras. \n\n> so they've done really fucking well, considering what they've been put through by us.\n\nthis is basically the story of Latin America -- exploited for centuries by European nations as colonies, then after gaining independence, turned over to US/western-backed puppet dictators who refused to nationalize industries or institute economic reforms to allow American/western companies to continue to exploit their natural resources. \n\nIt's why Cuba is the thorn in the side of imperialism/colonialism -- Castro (whatever his faults re: political prisoners and suppression of dissenters) successfully kept a country fed, clothed, and educated without any real material support from allies, on an island nation isolated from its closest neighboring mainland. While other Latin American nations may have fared better or worse with socialism (Venezuela is a notable failure due to Chavez's cult of personality, but Bolivia and Uruguay stand out as well-functioning democracies with significant numbers of leftists/socialists in government, and somehow that never gets much press in the States), but it cannot be argued that repressive, right-wing governments in Latin America have any better track record, e.g., Pinochet or Peron.
