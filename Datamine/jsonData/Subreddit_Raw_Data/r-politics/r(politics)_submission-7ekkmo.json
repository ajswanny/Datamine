First, there is an argument to be made that it violates section 553 (c) which requires a concise general statement as to why they ignored the vast majority of comments against the rule (which assumes many things leading up to that point).  Second, one can argue it violates section 706 (2)(a) which holds unlawful and sets aside agency action, findings, and conclusions found to be arbitrary and capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law. Third, there are constitutional issues with this proposed rule.\n\nIn my opinion, the internet is free speech protected under the 1st amendment, thus, corporations shall not abridge free speech by profiting from the removal of net neutrality. \n\nAs always, there will be many arguments against my point. One comment below pointed many of them out. We cannot rely on yelling into the echochambers of the internet we are trying to protect. We must engage reality and peacefully force change.

This is out of nearly 22 million total comments.  One form letter against NN was submitted 7.8 million times, using fake/generated email addresses.  \n\nAll these fake comments from bots allowed the FCC to de-legitimize the entire public comment process.  It is weaponized disinformation.  There are advantages to the default of pseudo-anonymity on the Internet, but this is one costs.\n\nIt's sad that this has become such a political issue, but that's just the reality of the situation.  The Republican party (and Koch-funded libertarian policy institutes) have systematically undermined antitrust enforcement for decades.  They complain about \"regulatory capture,\" the corrupt relationship between industry and government agencies, but this is projection.  THEY are the worst offenders.  Want an example?  Look no further than [Republican former commissioner Baker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meredith_Attwell_Baker).  After the FCC approved the merger of NBC/Universal and Comcast, she resigned from the commission and became the vice president for government affairs at the combined entity.  This is how the industry quasi-legally hands out huge piles of cash to reward its corrupt servants.  This is precisely the kind of swamp-monster behavior that needs to be burned out of Washington, and it's exactly the opposite of what the party of projection and their hypocrite-in-chief have been up to.\n\nThere's a small chance that this will be stopped by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, but... in reality?  The only way you're going to stop this long-term is to elect Democrats.\n",

You can click [here, to go to the FCC's official contact page.](https://www.fcc.gov/about/contact)\n\nYou need to contact your representatives and senators about **Net Neutrality** even if they already support it, but *especially* if they don't.   \n  \nRemember that this very thread is only possible because of a free and open internet; kill net neutrality and threads like this might be a thing of the past.\n\nEasy way #1:\n  \nStep 1: Go to [BattleForTheNet.com.](https://www.battleforthenet.com/)  \nStep 2: Do what [BattleForTheNet.com](https://www.battleforthenet.com/) tells you to do.  \n  \n---  \n  \nEasy way #2:  \n  \nText RESIST to 50409, and they'll walk you through the process.  (I've been told.  I've never done it myself.  Fees and whatnot may apply.)  \n\n---\n \nThe harder, but still very easy way:\n\nStep 1:  Find out who your Representative and Senator is/are.  \n  \n * [Find your Representative.](https://www.house.gov/representatives/find-your-representative)  \n * [Find your Senator.](https://www.senate.gov/senators/contact/)  \n * [Local elected officials.](https://www.usa.gov/elected-officials)  \n\n\nStep 2: Find your Representative and Senator's contact information.  \n\n * [5calls.org has a decent repository of Representatives and Senators contact information, though the site is a bit difficult to navigate.](https://5calls.org/)  \n * [Call My Congress just asks for your zip code and tells you what district you live in, who your Representatives are, and how to contact them.](https://www.callmycongress.com/)\n * [DailyKos has a list of *all* of our Senator's phone numbers, not just the DC office.](https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2017/2/2/1629046/-Call-your-senator-Phone-numbers-for-every-office-of-every-U-S-senator)  (Current as of February, 2017.)  \n * FaxZero has a system set up allowing you to fax your [Representatives](https://faxzero.com/fax_congress.php) and [Senators](https://faxzero.com/fax_senate.php) for free!  (Faxes are good if you can't get through on the phone lines, or just if you want congressional staffers to listen to fax machine noises until Net Neutrality is safe.)  \n \n  * [Fax Congress](https://faxzero.com/fax_congress.php)  \n  * [Fax Senators](https://faxzero.com/fax_senate.php)  \n  \nStep 3: Call, write, or fax to express your feelings on this.  \n  \nA lot of people are nervous about calling their elected officials for the first time, maybe you don't know what to say, or how to say it, or even who you'll be talking to, so here's what you'll need to know.  \n  \n1. There's a 75% chance your call will be answered by a Secretary who is specifically there to listen to your concerns, there's a 25% chance your call will be bumped into a voicemail box which is specifically there to listen to your concerns, there is a ~0% chance you'll find yourself on the phone with your Senator or Representative.  \n  \n2.  You may be asked for your name and address or zip code, it's okay not to tell them if you don't want to, but the information *is* useful for your elected officials.  I usually just give my first name, zip code, and the name of my town.  \n  \n3.  Don't worry about a script, don't worry about being eloquent, you're not writing Shakespeare here, you're a concerned citizen voicing their frustrations, fears, and hopes.  \"I'm really scared of Ajit Pai's plans to roll back net neutrality, a free and open internet is important to me because [Your reason here.  Some suggestions: An open internet is important to democracy/I worry what Donald Trump might do with more power/Cable bills are already too high/etc.].  Please tell [Senator or Representative] that I support a free and open internet, I support Net Neutrality, ***and I vote.***\"  The only hard and fast rule is that you need to be polite; these folks are getting dozens, if not hundreds of calls a day, they don't need you bitching and swearing at them for something they have no control over.  Be passionate, but be polite.  \n  \nReminder: ***Only call YOUR OWN elected officials!***  Calling Mitch McConnell from sunny Florida won't do anyone any good, and might actually harm the cause.  Only call your own elected officials, period.  \n\n---\n  \nSpread this information around, you can click **\"source\"** at the bottom of the comment to see an unformatted copy of this post that you can copy and paste.

First, there is an argument to be made that it violates section 553 (c) which requires a concise general statement as to why they ignored the vast majority of comments against the rule\n\nAn argument can be made that *what* violates 553? The final rule hasn\u2019t been adopted yet, and the speculation that they might fail to address the substance of those comments is... well, pure speculation.\n\nBut it\u2019s important to be clear on what the APA requires.\n\n>requires a concise general statement as to why they ignored the vast majority of comments against the rule\n\nNo, it doesn\u2019t. The agency has no obligation to address what constituted the \u201cvast majority\u201d of comments, only to address the substantive arguments and evidence raised by those comments. An agency *may* consider predominant public opinion, but is not bound by it nor bound by explaining why they didn\u2019t follow \u201cthe vast majority of comments.\u201d\n\n>one can argue it violates section 706 (2)(a) which holds unlawful and sets aside agency action, findings, and conclusions found to be arbitrary and capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\n\nOne can, but is unlikely to be successful. Absent a statutory requirement that \u201chow many people support the rule versus opposing it\u201d be a factor to be considered (NB: such a statutory requirement does not exist here), the number of comments is irrelevant. Which means we\u2019re in traditional informal rulemaking analysis. \n\nAnd as the Court has repeatedly explained, the courts are not meant to override an agency on a matter of policy based solely on disagreeing with the agency\u2019s view of the right policy. *See Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n v. State Farm Mut. Ins. Co.*, 463 U.S. 29 (1983)\n\nOr, to put it more simply:\n\nAn agency is not required to prove that it made a good decision, only that its \u201cexplanation [demonstrate] that it examined the data, considered the relevant factors, and made a reasonable judgment based on the record.\u201d *MD Pharm., Inc. v.

In addition if someone from another state called or wrote that information was not logged. \n\nAlso the people answering are generally interns, especially in the summer. If whoever answers is good and decent at their job they should ask you for your zip code even if you forget to give it and even if the views you are expressing goes against the position of the elected official they are interning for. \n\nedit: spelling",

France's revolution was more about food at first then about \"freedom, brotherhood and equality\" \n\n2. Death - The killing of an important figure can set off the long held frustrations of a people. See the failed Paris Uprising of 1832 made famous in Les Miserable. \n\nBut more often it is a slow burn that boils over seemingly at random, where long and stable governments fall in days or weeks. See Romania in 1989. \n\nDec 17th - Small protests, led to bigger student anti-gov protests. \n\nDec 21st - Dictator gives speech to \"pro-communist\" crowd, gets booed and heckled on live TV, looks nervous. Protests grow but are stopped by the military.\n\nDec 22nd - mass protests around the whole country. People break into gov buildings, flees by helicopter.\n\nDec 25th - tried and executed by provisional gov.\n\nWhile this is a short example I doubt that on Dec 1st he would have thought that he would be dead by the 25th. \n\nTLDR: Revolutions usually happen after a long time of anger and feelings of being unheard. Then something happens and the long simmer turns into a boil that sometimes boils over into a full revolution, but can often be suppressed by military might. See Hungry 1956.",

    "body": "It\u2019s important to start off by distinguishing a few things. First, what Pai said was that \u201cthe raw number is not as important as the substantive comments that are in the record\u201d, and that is true.\n\nThe administrative procedures act requires that the agency respond to the comments, not that it give any particular credence to them. If the final rule addresses the substantive arguments of a million pre-written comments submitted from \u201cgofccyourself.net\u201d, those million comments have been sufficiently addressed.\n\nNor does the agency have to provide specific response to conclusory comments of the \u201cI want net neutrality to stay, don\u2019t get rid of it\u201d variety.\n\n>And ignoring the documented false submissions would also seem to show any rule making is based on false data.\n\nProbably not, unless there is some information contained in those submissions that does not appear in any other source in the agency\u2019s record.\n\nThis whole fight over the number of comments on either side has never been relevant, the agency is not bound by the numbers. The fact that there were submissions claiming to be from individuals who didn\u2019t actually submit them doesn\u2019t really matter unless the agency were required to give weight based on volume of comments, which they aren\u2019t.\n\nThink of it this way: the fact that there are five million comments saying \u201cit will be bad for new internet startups who may not be able to buy priority bandwidth\u201d is not required (under the APA) to mean more than if there were five of them. \n\nThe fact that there were 200 comments saying that this would be good for consumers as it allows for those who don\u2019t use as much bandwidth to stop subsidizing more consuming users doesn\u2019t matter more than if there were 2.\n\nSo even if half of all anti-net neutrality comments were \u201cfalse submissions\u201d, it wouldn\u2019t matter. The half that are properly there are still on the record and can still form some basis of the rule. The only way it would matter is if the agency gave those arguments more weight because of the number of unique submissions, which they are unlikely to.\n\n>Anybody with any experience of this know if that\u2019s the case and any case law/precedence?\n\nFor which part?\n\nI\u2019m not being glib, it\u2019s just a really big subject and I don\u2019t want to waste your time citing cases for the proposition that the volume of comments supporting a particular view is irrelevant if what you really care about is what is considered sufficient to have addressed the comments\u2019 substance.\n\nAnd a big part of this is going to depend on how the final rule is actually phrased. If it\u2019s argued as a matter of statutory interpretation (i.e the FCC saying \u201cwe cannot regulate broadband as common carriers because they fall under information services rather than telecommunications, but we can require greater transparency as a matter of policy\u201d) the agency arguably gets *Chevron* deference and agencies rarely lose with *Chevron* deference. \n\nThough then you get into some interesting cases about whether a prior agency statutory interpretation was viewed as the *only* interpretation, or just a *valid* interpretation.\n\nIf it\u2019s a pure policy issue? There we get into sufficiency of response, and the cases where the courts have held that an agency failed to consider comments are predominately cases where the agency actually failed to respond to them in their rulemaking.\n\n> I\u2019m still confused as to whether the way the public comment period was handled is problematic for their moving forward with the rulemaking process\n\nWell... the easier way to do this might be to ask what you think was problematic.\n\nThey issued notice, received comments, and we\u2019re awaiting the final rulemaking which will be required to consider (i.e respond to) the substantive arguments raised in the comments. \n\nIf your question is whether what Pai said somehow makes the rulemaking less valid... not really, he accurately stated that an agency is not bound by considerations of sheer volume of comments.",

    "body": "I think they are on board with fascism's general tenants. Look at this list and see if it looks familiar. They are calling themselves \"Neo-Reactionaries\" now. \n\nUmberto Eco, 14 points:\n\n\n * The cult of tradition. \u201cOne has only to look at the syllabus of every fascist movement to find the major traditionalist thinkers. The Nazi gnosis was nourished by traditionalist, syncretistic, occult elements.\u201d\n \n* The rejection of modernism. \u201cThe Enlightenment, the Age of Reason, is seen as the beginning of modern depravity. In this sense Ur-Fascism can be defined as irrationalism.\u201d\n   \n* The cult of action for action\u2019s sake. \u201cAction being beautiful in itself, it must be taken before, or without, any previous reflection. Thinking is a form of emasculation.\u201d\n \n*  Disagreement is treason. \u201cThe critical spirit makes distinctions, and to distinguish is a sign of modernism. In modern culture the scientific community praises disagreement as a way to improve knowledge.\u201d\n \n* Fear of difference. \u201cThe first appeal of a fascist or prematurely fascist movement is an appeal against the intruders. Thus Ur-Fascism is racist by definition.\u201d\n  \n *  Appeal to social frustration. \u201cOne of the most typical features of the historical fascism was the appeal to a frustrated middle class, a class suffering from an economic crisis or feelings of political humiliation, and frightened by the pressure of lower social groups.\u201d\n   \n*  The obsession with a plot. \u201cThe followers must feel besieged. The easiest way to solve the plot is the appeal to xenophobia.\u201d\n   \n*  The enemy is both strong and weak. \u201cBy a continuous shifting of rhetorical focus, the enemies are at the same time too strong and too weak.\u201d\n   \n * Pacifism is trafficking with the enemy. \u201cFor Ur-Fascism there is no struggle for life but, rather, life is lived for struggle.\u201d\n    \n* Contempt for the weak. \u201cElitism is a typical aspect of any reactionary ideology.\u201d\n   \n* Everybody is educated to become a hero. \u201cIn Ur-Fascist ideology, heroism is the norm. This cult of heroism is strictly linked with the cult of death.\u201d (This is what is different from standard fascism: (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverted_totalitarianism)\n\n*  Machismo and weaponry. \u201cMachismo implies both disdain for women and intolerance and condemnation of nonstandard sexual habits, from chastity to homosexuality.\u201d\n  \n *  Selective populism. \u201cThere is in our future a TV or Internet populism, in which the emotional response of a selected group of citizens can be presented and accepted as the Voice of the People.\u201d\n    \n*  Ur-Fascism speaks Newspeak. \u201cAll the Nazi or Fascist schoolbooks made use of an impoverished vocabulary, and an elementary syntax, in order to limit the instruments for complex and critical reasoning.\u201d\n ",

    "body": "> Most Americans see the word Liberal and think something on the order of Keynesian doctrine and what Democrats espouse with social safety nets and moderate regulation policies. \n\nWait, what? Neo-liberalism has been associated with lasse-fair capitalism in the US since the 70s. That's a change from it's earlier meaning (that most americans would have never heard of) where it was associated with european economies (especially Germanys [Social Market Economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_market_economy)) trying the bridge the gap between classical liberalism (which had catastrophic consequences, see 19th century europe) and the command economy of the socialist countries (themselfs a result of the catastrophic outcomes of classical liberalism..). Neo-liberalism was never about Keynesianism itself, and in the new american (and now essentially global) meaning of neo-liberalism is is specifically *against* Keynesianism, because it's basically \"lasse-fair capitalism, again\".\n\nDemocrats are neo-liberal, but republicans are neo-liberal ***as fuck***.",

Obama agreed to extend the Bush tax cuts for all of his years in office, with the effect of cutting taxes on corporations and the investor class by $6 trillion. The establishment Democrats have been corporatists since Bill Clinon. Another interesting fact - Obama appointed neoliberal (i.e mainstream) economists to the Federal Reserve like Bernanke and Yellen, who engaged in zero interest rate policies and quantitative easing (free money, basically) that have enriched the 1% tremendously by inflating financial asset markets and subsidizing investors and the private banking system. All this free money from central banks has amounted to $20-$25 trillion worldwide from the big 5 alone being pumped into financial markets through free money policies. The big 5 central banks are the Federal Reserve, People\u2019s Bank of China, European Central Bank, Bank of Japan, and the Bank of England. ",
