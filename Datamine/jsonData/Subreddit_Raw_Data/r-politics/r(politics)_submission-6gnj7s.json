    "body": "And this from the man Obama defeated for president in 2008.\n_______________________________________________________________\nEdit: to all those criticizing McCain for Palin/Trump support/Republican votes/etc...\n\nAs a Berniecrat I still recognize and honor McCain for his service to this country both in government and the Navy.  I often wonder what this country would have been like if Bush's swift-boaters hadn't succeeded in attacking McCain by slurring him in suggesting through right wing news sites he had a secret \"Black\" daughter who was actually his adopted Bangladeshi daughter during the 2000 Republican primary campaign.  Would he have been a better leader during 9/11?  Would he have gotten us into Iraq?  How would our country be different if he had won in 2000?  Yes the 2008 election brought us Palin but it was also one of the best and cleanest elections defined by debate and ideas and not personal attacks.  I would have opposed McCain's ideas but recognized the debate and his fitness for the presidency.  McCain is my respected and honorable opponent with which to debate the questions and ideas that make this country great (even if he is a bit senile now).\n____\nEdit 2: to all the people saying all Republicans are evil and must be defeated. \n\nIf we are to lead as Progressives and Social Democrats we must recognize that Republicans like McCain are defined by service, morality and sacrifice while men like Trump are defined by greed, power and selfishness.  We have to see the differences within the Republican party.  We must honor the conservative opponent who is honest and open minded, who comes to the table without fear or prejudice.  We must see McCain as our respected opponent who we must debate until we convince, and Trump as the enemy who's ideas we must defeat.\n____\nIf you're looking for reason's to respect and honor McCain while still respectfully disagreeing with his ideas and policies watch these:\n\n* [McCain's 2008 concession speech](https://youtu.be/NvgqRKYapU8?t=21)\n* [McCain defending Obama from birthers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrnRU3ocIH4)\n* [McCain's absolute opposition to American torture during the Bush presidency](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDWdKix0Ees)\n* [McCain's relationship with the press and defense of a free press.  He's generally considered the most open and accessible presidential candidate to ever run and he gave more press access than any campaign, ever, according to the New York Times.](http://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/video/-that-s-how-dictators-get-started-mccain-defends-the-free-press-880252483608)\n* [McCain's belief in adoption and his interracial family photo's are truly representative of our America](http://img2-3.timeinc.net/people/i/2013/news/130617/mccain-wedding-4-600.jpg)\n* [McCain has been at the forefront of lingering issues about the Vietnam War such as Agent Orange medical care for both side's veterans, relations with Vietnam and POW/MIA remains](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-56puj5g_o)\n\nAlmost forgot this one:\n\n* [McCain just recently saved some Obama era environmental protections which shocked Republican leadership](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2017/05/10/senates-poised-to-repeal-a-final-obama-era-rule-as-soon-as-wednesday/?utm_term=.3cec0bdf1aa6)\n\nHe is a unique American voice and American Hero and we would be lucky to have had him as president in 2000 or now instead of Bush or Trump.

    "body": "The truth of Corbyn is a little less mystical than you've put it. The reason that expectations could be so thoroughly defied by him is because his lackluster charisma and heretofore approach to campaigning has left Labour's chances in an election look awfully bad, hence the 20+ point lead that the Tories had leading up to the start of the last election. Fortunately he has been really following the Sanders playbook which served him very well for obvious reasons, but he actually isn't especially charismatic and certainly not some kind of \"Batman of the left\".\n\nThe reasons the Tories did so badly this time around are numerous as always, and if anything this is sort of like a reversal of the US election: old woman displaying the charisma of an old boot runs tedious campaign on neoliberal austerity messaging while old white guy who wasn't particularly well-liked or expected to succeed in a national election runs on a populist campaign of providing for the middle and working classes and does much better than expected. The biggest differences of course being that this old guy is a former union lobbyist, person of decades-long political experience and possess an IQ higher than the number of current lawsuits against him, so there is great reason to suspect that he would actually be fighting for those people instead of every single thing he's ever said being a lie. That, and that the old whinging neoliberal whose campaign slogan could have been \"No We Can't!\" is actually in charge of everything because she won the most goddamn votes.\n\nThis is actually better for us, I think (the first part about Corbyn that is). Keep in mind that despite the unexpected result and deserved praise for Corbyn's performance, they were only able to take 12 seats from the Tories in the end leaving the Tories still with a 56 seat lead over Labour. What this result shows I think is that when a leftist politician who isn't well-known or even particularly charismatic adopts a populist platform of making government actually work to solve people's problems, people respond and young people actually show up. One of the biggest reasons these results were so unexpected is actually because the major pollsters, nervous after major polling errors in the recent past, chose a variety of arbitrary methods to weight the polls in favour of the right, one of which being to hugely decrease the counting of young people saying they were going to vote by the logic of simply refusing to believe them. In reality the raw polling data was fairly accurate in terms of youth turnout, because the Sanders style platform actually does bring young people to the voting booth in large numbers. Obama ran on a similar kind of platform in 2008, and had the charisma to back it up and the 2008 national election was an absolute evisceration of the GOP, with a 9.5M vote deficit, the highest turnout % since 1960 and a gain of 8 seats in the Senate, 21 in the House and one governor's mansion and 2 state legislatures (on the back of a big wave election the previous cycle no less, not achieved since 1932). The message itself is extremely powerful in a way that goes far beyond simply having a strong candidate, and left-leaning parties all over the world have to be noticing this. ",

When I turned 18 I registered non-partisan, but a pre-filled voter registration came to my house with republican already selected: All I would have had to do if I were republican leaning is drop it in the mail.  The next election, the same thing happened with a pre-filled absentee voting ballot; the only thing left for me to add if I wanted to vote then and there was my signature and the bubbles next to names.  Multiple times in the weeks prior to the elections, I get Republican candidate branded mailers telling me where my polling station is, when to vote, and more reminders to vote absentee if I can't make it in person, with numbers to call and websites and e-mails to direct all questions and concerns to.  And those mailers are for both national and state level alike!  \n\nMeanwhile, all I got from the democratic party was an in-depth survey with space for short essay responses to every question on the 5 page document.  Do I personally prefer this approach more? God yes, but I already vote in each and every election.  For uninvolved or unaffiliated voters waffling about whether to vote, the republican approach seems like it would work better on making sure people get out to vote and have a name fresh in their mind.  \n\nDemocrats, Keep asking for detailed responses sure, but make sure people know for damn sure where to vote and when and why it really matters that they do. Republicans, stop trying to trick me into changing my non-partisan registration into a Repub registration.  I registered that way for a reason",
