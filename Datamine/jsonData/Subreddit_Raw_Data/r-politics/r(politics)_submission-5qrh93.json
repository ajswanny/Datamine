And knowing there was a timeline on when we had to be out of the country was a silent burden in the back of our minds daily. Knowing that when we took a trip back to the States, there was a chance we may not have been allowed back in. Sure, it's very unlikely, but it could've happened and would've been legal. And our cats and stuff would have all just been there\n\nI can't imagine what it was like for immigrants to reach the airport and realize that they were detained. That their worst nightmare was coming true. They probably had keepsakes in their US homes. Maybe a blanket from their childhood. The last picture of their deceased parents. Maybe they had companion animals depending on them. That feeling, of having a home but knowing it legally cannot be permanent... is beyond tough. And coming home, only find out that despite your paperwork, you can't go home... I wouldn't wish it on anyone.\n\nEDIT: Since it looks like I made it sound like this happened to us, I wanted to clarify that nothing bad ever happened to us. They were just fears that affected our daily life, and our greatest fear was going back to find out we couldn't go to our home. Apparently I shouldn't write this when I'm half asleep.",

We are particularly concerned by reports that this order went into effect with little to no consultation with the Departments of State, Defense, Justice, and Homeland Security. \n\n>\u201cSuch a hasty process risks harmful results. We should not stop green-card holders from returning to the country they call home. We should not stop those who have served as interpreters for our military and diplomats from seeking refuge in the country they risked their lives to help. And we should not turn our backs on those refugees who have been shown through extensive vetting to pose no demonstrable threat to our nation, and who have suffered unspeakable horrors, most of them women and children.\n\n>\u201cUltimately, we fear this executive order will become a self-inflicted wound in the fight against terrorism. At this very moment, American troops are fighting side-by-side with our Iraqi partners to defeat ISIL. But this executive order bans Iraqi pilots from coming to military bases in Arizona to fight our common enemies. Our most important allies in the fight against ISIL are the vast majority of Muslims who reject its apocalyptic ideology of hatred. This executive order sends a signal, intended or not, that America does not want Muslims coming into our country. That is why we fear this executive order may do more to help terrorist recruitment than improve our security.\u201d",

My entries for essay and art contests tended to be themed around red, white, & blue. My fifth grade \"graduation\" speech was about the American dream. \n\nI was smitten -  We were told that in America, it didn't matter what you looked like, where you came from, how much money you had - if you worked hard and adopted American values, you could achieve the American dream. That America was different and great because we were a community of people from all over the world. That people who come here with nothing (like my parents) have the chance for a new life. \"Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free...\" I believed it all.\n\nNow it all seems like a cruel joke, and I keep finding myself making contingency plans in case we ever need to escape the US.",

All a government can do is recognize, or fail to recognize and violate, your rights as a human being.

This is the first sign of federal people clearly doing whatever he wants, legal or not.  \"Just doing my job\" is not really good.  \n\nWhy aren't we seeing even a single case of a federal employee going against this at customs?  Like out of tens of thousands (or more?), not a single one stepped out of line.  Not one?  So what's next, are other major armed parts of the federal government going to do the same when I wake up tomorrow?\n\nedit:  To the people PMing me laws and constitutions and everything else.  I'm not questioning the legality of this.  I'm worried precisely because he has the power to make something that was not legal into a law/order/call it what you will, and not a single person stepped out of line.  Yes the border patrol 'protects' the US, but it's also a federal agency with bucket of military arsenal at its disposal.  So while they are not military, they *are* people and are a good example of what military people can do.  I have a ton of military in my family (live near SD), and most of them are dumb as shit (nothing against the others) and would blindly follow their CO into fire (edit: well, they'll blindly cause fire, I don't know if they'd actually put their lives on the line, in fact a couple of them told me they definitely wouldn't, which is why they signed up to be in a non-combatant posts).  The fact that we needed a court ruling here to make thousands of people with military grade weapons to stop doing something is pretty troubling.  Like this is a clear sign that when he orders it, people with really powerful guns will follow - all the political/legal symbolism aside (including the ruling) - that's the most horrifying sign for what's to come.  He's in charge of this shit now and people are following.",

This included many people who were greencard holders or had valid immigrant or non-immigrant visas. ACLU filed an action to enjoin the government from deporting those people and the judge granted a stay of the order, though only as to those who were already legally authorized to be here. Meaning anyone who held a valid visa/greencard was supposed to be released pending further litigation- I believe the hearing date is Feb 21.  \n\nSome people have been released but not the response from DHS/CBP is that they are continuing to enforce the EO. This is a huge violation of the Constitution.  At least one person who should have been released was deported. \n\nWe are in the middle of an actual constitutional crisis. ",
