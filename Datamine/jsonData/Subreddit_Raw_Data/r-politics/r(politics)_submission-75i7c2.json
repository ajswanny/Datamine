Look at my hands. They\u2019re fine. Nobody other than Graydon Carter years ago used to use that. My hands are normal hands. During a debate, he was losing, and he said, \u201cOh, he has small hands and therefore, you know what that means.\u201d This was not me. This was Rubio that said, \u201cHe has small hands and you know what that means.\u201d Okay? So, he started it. So, what I said a couple of days later \u2026 and what happened is I was on line shaking hands with supporters, and one of supporters got up and he said, \u201cMr. Trump, you have strong hands. You have good-sized hands.\u201d And then another one would say, \u201cYou have great hands, Mr. Trump, I had no idea.\u201d I said, \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d He said, \u201cI thought you were like deformed, and I thought you had small hands.\u201d I had fifty people \u2026 Is that a correct statement? I mean people were writing, \u201cHow are Mr. Trump\u2019s hands?\u201d My hands are fine. You know, my hands are normal. Slightly large, actually. In fact, I buy a slightly smaller than large glove, okay? No, but I did this because everybody was saying to me, \u201cOh, your hands are very nice. They are normal.\u201d So Rubio, in a debate, said, because he had nothing else to say \u2026 now I was hitting him pretty hard. He wanted to do his Don Rickles stuff and it didn\u2019t work out. Obviously, it didn\u2019t work too well. But one of the things he said was \u201cHe has small hands and therefore, you know what that means, he has small something else.\u201d You can look it up. I didn\u2019t say it.*\n\n> **MARCUS:** *You chose to raise it \u2026*\n\n>**TRUMP:** *No, I chose to respond.*\n\n> **MARUS:** *You chose to respond.*\n\n>**TRUMP:** *I had no choice.*\n\n> **MARCUS:** *You chose to raise it during a debate. Can you explain why you had no choice?*\n\n>**TRUMP:** *I don\u2019t want people to go around thinking that I have a problem. I\u2019m telling you, Ruth, I had so many people. I would say 25, 30 people would tell me \u2026 every time I\u2019d shake people\u2019s hand, \u201cOh, you have nice hands.\u201d Why shouldn\u2019t I? And, by the way, by saying that I solved the problem.

I wasn't single, but my sister was speaking so I went to support her and she had asked me to give some input as a married person and mother of 3. \n\nAfterwards, this guy came up to my sister to ask her some questions (she'd been speaking about making meaningful connections). He was complaining about how he could never find women who shared his interests. He then dropped in the conversation that he was a member of Mensa, which seemed not at all relevant to the conversation. \n\nMy sister politely gave him some advice and then asked how one became a member of Mensa. He said it was pretty much just a matter of IQ. My sister said she wasn't sure she would qualify, but she was sure I would. She mentions that my mom had my IQ tested when I was in grade school and she doesn't remember the exact number but she was pretty sure it was above 140. I have no real recollection of said IQ test or the results, or if my sister is remembering correctly. I've never taken a legitimate IQ test as any adult, so I kind of scoffed and said I wasn't sure about that. \n\nMr. Mensa looks at me skeptically and says, \"Well having babies lowers your IQ.\" I laughed, my sister was stunned into silence, and the guy just says, \"I'm sorry, but it's true.\" \n\nMy sister and I excused ourselves and then proceeded to laugh about the mystery that was how that guy couldn't find a relationship. \n\nSo yeah, that's my experience with Mensa. A guy so insecure about his own intelligence the he had to find ways to knock IQ points off of other people's unofficial, and probably inaccurate, IQs.\n\nEdit: I know this was just one dude, and I'm sure there are people in Mensa who are not like him, but it certainly turned me off of the idea. \n\n",

Immigration officers had performed cursory physical and mental health screenings for years, but Goddard's methods revealed an astounding result: 40 percent of the Jews, Italians and Hungarians tested qualified as \"morons.\" He noted in his report, \"Doubtless the thought in every reader's mind is the same as in ours, that it is impossible that half of such a group of immigrants could be feeble-minded, but we know that it is never wise to discard a scientific result because of apparent absurdity.\"\n\nYou can see how these types of things helped fuel some really awful things, like sterilizing \"idiots\" for not passing a test, especially if there is a communication barrier. Or assuming that black people are inherently dumb because of incarceration rates. \n\nIt does go on to mention that he eventually changed his mind on some things, such as his belief that being a moron was incurable and that morons need to be segregated in institutions.
