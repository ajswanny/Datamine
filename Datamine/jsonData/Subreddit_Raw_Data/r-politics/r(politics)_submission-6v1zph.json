Nothing is stopping Trump from spending his weekends at Camp David instead of Trump owned property, selling his Trump owned property or not raising the rates of his property. When the Secret Service rented the cottage next to Joe Biden's house (Google it) Joe Biden charged them exactly what he charged the last tenant, when he stayed in Delaware.

    "body": "I've always personally politically identified as a fiscal conservative and social liberal (which, yes, feels oxymoronic at times). This is painful. I like the idea of a smaller government, and I like the idea that people who can help themselves *should* help themselves, and the community assists those who cannot. \n\nBut that's not really what's happening here. It's more like even though Trump could help by providing free golf carts (for the paltry sum of $13,500 for the past vacation) for those who are protecting him and his family - thus *helping himself* - he chooses to have his business charge the money. He can't say \"I have nothing to do with that!\" because he hasn't fully divested himself - and his protectoree children run it and make the same choice. \n\nYet when it comes to protecting federal lands from logging or fracking, it doesn't directly benefit the Trumps for that land to remain pristine, so screw it. Let's save money there. \n\nTrump is doing exactly what everyone blames Millennials for - being all about \"Me, Me, Me\". ",
