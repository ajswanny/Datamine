I have a couple hundred of credit card debt total, and I could pay it off right now without pain.

Also we owe China enough money to put a colony on the moon.\"\n\nI agree that when political conservatives say that, it's usually what you're saying. They lambaste \"dirty liberals\" as being tax-and-spend, while they're cut-taxes-and-spend-anyway, which is WORSE.

Chemotherapy, on the other hand - and much like abortion - *is* inherently unpleasant... but people still choose to do it because the alternative is far worse.\n\nNobody *likes* chemotherapy, and nobody *likes* abortion, because they're inherently unpleasant, distressing experiences.  We like *very much* that they're *available*, however, because (while horrible) they're very much the lesser of two evils.",

The strongest and more able did the heavier lifting to care for the community as a whole.  \nToday, the church is full of angry, selfish Trump supporters who treat the poor as ungrateful for whatever little charity the church gives them. They give just enough to say they give, but tons of big church leaders just do the job because it's a 6 figure gig with big tax breaks and loopholes. It pays big to preach in the U.S. if you're with the right church. My own family tried to get me to go back to their big mega church during the recession because it would be a great opportunity to network with community leaders and get a job. Yeah.
