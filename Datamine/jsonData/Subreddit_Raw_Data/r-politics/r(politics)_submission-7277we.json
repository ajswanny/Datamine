Which is worse, breaking a rule at work or breaking the law?\n2) Trump's White House staff have been violating the Presidential Records Act.  Why did Congress pass this Act?  It was because Nixon kept his tapes secret, finally resigning before getting impeached.  Now Trump, or at least his campaign staff (many are now White House advisors), are being investigated for conspiring with Russia during the election. Trump's staff have been violating the Presidential Records Act **while being investigated**!  \n3) While you could argue that Clinton wasn't aware at the time of how big of political issue using private email would become, Trump and his staff absolutely know the political implications.  That means they are intentionally violating the law and risking the political shitstorm that will surely follow.  You would only do this if using govt communications would be worse ... like having records available to an investigation. \n\ntl/dr - Trump's White House use of private communications is a MUCH bigger deal than Clinton's.  They are taking huge legal and political risks by willfully violating a law in order to keep their communications away from an active investigation that may lead to the impeachment of a president.

From the infamous opening statement it appears there were only three things Trump cared about - loyalty, leaks, and the hookers. One of these things is not like the others.\n\nAlso, it's a pattern of behavior - he was pressing Mueller on not looking into his finances and targeting his family, when Mueller was the man who took down Enron and is notorious for going after their families. He kept pressing Comey on the hookers, when Comey was involved in the FBI taking down a child trafficking ring back in 2016 (an iteration of Operation Cross Country), is involved in child advocacy and fostering, and generally seems to have a bit of a \"white knight\" thing when it comes to kids.\n\nThen there is the BBC article on the kompromat http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-38589427 where it's stated that there are \"multiple tapes\" in \"multiple cities\". Even if the pee tape is \"just\" grown women pissing on a bed, there's a chance that whatever else Putin has on him is worse, and THAT is what he's really shitting himself about. \n\nAnd it might have been \"fed\" to Steele as a low key warning to Trump - \"keep your shit in line because you *know* we can and will release the worse tapes if you don't behave\".",
