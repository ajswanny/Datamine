Both of those counties went blue when Lee County is usually Red. Both are also mostly rural counties, with Lee County becoming more Urban in the last decade due to Fort Benning, Columbus, Phenix City, Opelika, and Auburn all being so close together.\n\n\nAs a white male in Alabama, holy shit, white male republicans are a disgrace to this county and humanity.\n\n**Edit: because more deserves to be said about the shitty people who voted for Child predator scum Roy Moore**\n\nDown here in the south Black people and white people have their own churches and its pretty obvious that black people are not learning the same bigoted stuff in their christian churches that white people are learning in their churches.\n\nThe big problem is religion, it just so happens that black people go to churches with good christian values and white people go to churches with evil, anti-science, pro nazi, anti-facts, pro-gun, pro-hate, pro-racism, and anti-american values.\n\nA lot of the racism, comes from that separation and the bigoted values of white people, especially white males is reinforced inside their evil values churches. They take all those evil, anti-science, and anti-fact values on faith.\n\nLets Analyze Roy Moore and question how the hell people could support this human scum.\n\n1. Child Molester (His lawyers were even making excuses for him) You know the allegations are true when the lawyers are throwing out ridiculous excuses for his actions.\n2. Child Rapist (His lawyers claimed all the 18+ girls were married when he came back from vietnam so his only options were high school girls)\n3. Child Predator ( His lawyer claimed young girls were more pure than women, despite the fact that Roy Moore tried raping them on their first dates.)\n4. Believes being gay should be illegal\n5. Thinks women shouldnt be allowed to vote.\n6. Wants to get rid of half the constitution such as the parts that get rid of slavery, let black people vote, let women vote, and much more.\n7. Believes Bibilical law surpasses US law and the US constitution or the Alabama constitution for that matter.\n8. Doesnt respect the constitution and was removed as a judge 2x.\n9. Hes as racist as you can get. Tells the 1 black person at his last rally that the country was great when slavery was still around because families were together, completely ignoring the fact that black people were constantly ripped apart from their own families and sold off.\n10.  He also thinks only christians should be able to serve in government and attacked Muslim Keith Ellison for being a muslim congressman.\n11. He praises Putin and Russia, but has nothing but insults for the United States constitution and American values. He hates the United States.\n12. He believes the US derserved what happened on 9/11 because of how many gay people live in the United States. Hes a traitor to this country and our values. \n13. Forgot to mention, he also has stated he doesnt think women should be allowed to be politicians, in addition to not be allowed to vote.\n\nWhat kinda scum supports a man who supported the 9/11 terrorist attacks?\n\n\nThis man is pure scum. Anyone who voted for them is pure scum in my book.\n\nI bet it pisses off so many of the Alabama fans that Nick Saban (A Big ole Democrat) played a big part in helping Doug Jones get his campaign up and running and helped Doug Jones win.\n\nThere are youtube videos of his lawyers making excuses for him, him claiming being gay should be illegal, him claiming we deserved to be attacked on 9/11 and him supporting Al Qaeda's actions because of gay people in the US. There are also youtube videos of much of what I stated above and its almost entirely coming from his own mouth our from his attorneys'/lawyers mouth.",

Alabama law requires at least two of the three members to be present for the certification.\nThe secretary of state's office told CNN before the election they expect to certify the results between December 27-29. That is contingent upon every county reporting their results on time. The office noted that a delay from one of the 67 counties could delay final certification.\n\n>Assuming all results are reported on time, Alabama can notify the Senate immediately, which would allow the winner to be sworn in at that time.\n\nI'm betting that in the reporting phase, some counties are going to conveniently \"lose\" their records.",

Don't hurt me, genuinely curious. \n\nEdit:  There are several really good responses here, thank you.  Based on what many of you are saying, it seems to me it would make it easier, and more fair, if all states had to abide by federal voting laws and no state could deviate from them.  If all Americans had the same voting experience and states and/or local municipalities could not implement their own voting laws that suppress any demographic I would think that would solve some of these issues.\n\nEdit 2: Another thought I just had was why are states allowed to come up with their own voting laws and methods?  If the constitution states we have a right to vote (Amendments 15, 19, 24, and 26 use language that protects the right to vote) then shouldn't the federal government be in full control of voting laws nation wide?",

I really dont know what we are supposed to do to get around it. The right has done such a *good* job politicizing this issue and making people believe it that it seems impossible to get around.\n\nI know my own dad is similar to yours. Probably ~8 years or so ago he went full tilt Ron Paul Libertarian for a while, and has undergone a lot of political view changes to the point of voting for Bernie Sanders in the primaries.\n\nHowever, he still has a *HUGE* issue with abortion and most of the time it stops him from voting Dem.",

And the GOP has fairly consistently opposed birth control, sex education, and access to those services (remember, Planned Parenthood isn't a drive-thru abortion clinic; in fact, abortions are ~1% of their total services if I remember my numbers right).

The goal of Russia's election meddling was to erode, and in some cases outright destroy, the average american's trust in his electoral system.  We're expecting to see foul play in almost every contentious election now.  In a climate like that, the less complicated the system, the better.  Once the Average american can have his faith in the system restored (if it ever can be), then moving to a system like what you described would be a good idea.  Right now, though, I fear all that would be treated as if it were too obscured and easy to game.  It might actually create *more* voter apathy, not less. Don't forget, that most americans are uneducated and don't really get what's going on in their government a lot of the time. right now, they understand 'vote for that guy, that guy wins.' but if you go all jeffersonian on them they're going to feel like they're playing baccarat and losing at every hand.
