Go after him through more substantial criticisms.\n\nBefore /r/politics gets out its pitchforks, there are some inconsistencies I have found with the story provided, and the 4 different songs that consist of reveille and retreat (Revielle, To the Colors, Retreat, and The National Anthem). Most people in the military won't even know of these distinctions unless you get really deep in the protocol, but I have the fortune of having these 4 songs burned into my living memory thanks to physically performing reveille and retreat for 4 years.\n\nWatching the [video](http://content.jwplatform.com/previews/PZ4iATqh-65XfsPGj) from the linked story, it seems like the interview occured in a hangar, which it technically \"indoors,\" meaning it is not subject to normal customs and courtesies that rendered to the flag when it is raised and lowered. So while he is a dumbass for not knowing what the song was being played for, he did nothing wrong by remaining seated and talking through it.\n\nThe song you hear in question is \"Retreat\" but it is not the same song that is played while the flag is lowered. It is in fact the preamble to the flag lowering ceremony. The only song played when the flag is lowered is the National Anthem. When \"Retreat\" sounds, all military members who are outside are required to stand silently at attention and face either the flag pole, or if none is in sight, face the direction the music is coming from. Once the song is completed (about 30 seconds) then The National Anthem will play, and the flag will slowly be lowered over the duration of the song. While the song is playing, all military members outside are required to salute, and remain saluted until the music is complete or if the flag is in sight, when the flag completely leaves the flag pole. \n\nThe reverse situation is true during the morning. First reveille sounds as a pre-amble, then \"To the Colors\" is played while the flag is raised as quickly as humanly possible, getting to the top of the pole before the song is over (which should not be very hard, unless the pulley mechanism freezes up).\n\nFurther Reading:\n\n\n> According to AFPAM 34-1202, 14.10.1, Reveille and Retreat, the U.S. flag is flown daily from reveille until retreat. Reveille is the raising of the flag for the day's activities and is a ceremony to honor the flag when it is raised in the morning and plays at 7 a.m. Retreat is the retirement of the flag from the day's activities and plays at 4:30 p.m.\n\n> During the playing of reveille and retreat, uniformed military personnel should stand at attention and face the American flag, or the direction of the music if a flag is not visible. If reveille or retreat is followed by the national anthem or \"To the Color,\" military personnel should salute (during the entirety of the song). source: http://www.malmstrom.af.mil/News/Features/Display/Article/825599/customs-and-courtesies-what-to-do-during-reveille-retreat-taps/",

Just because he went to a military school, what aspect of his character would lead anyone to believe that he actually did any of the work himself, that he actually learned anything, or that he has any respect for anyone or anything. This has nothing to do with the health of his brain, it has everything to do with the fact that he is a disgusting person, a horrible hypocrite, and a complete pussy.
