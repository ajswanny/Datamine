The purpose of education under Snyder and DeVos is to turn the state\u2019s once excellent system of public schools into an educational WalMart, boasting \u201clow, low prices\u201d in place of quality instruction.",

Her failures are his failures, and I will keep calling him to remind him of this. I was a Republican once. The party had been slowly falling and Rubio seemed like someone who might carry it forward. How foolish of me to allow my faith in a single man blind me to the festering cancer, the acquisition of wealth and power, that has consumed the GOP's desire to be champions of the people in the only way it ever could. By allying with, rather than trying to consume or destroy, their opposite ideological counterparts. America is great when we all work together. America is not great today.\n\nLet's take every opportunity to work together when we see the chance to and to talk and discuss when we catch sight of the glimmer of middle ground. Government, however you feel about it, has largely failed us and has been for a long time. The people must now be their own champions. We stand for each other, or we will never stand. No more excuses. No more missed voting days. No more showing up and learning of a position up for election or a proposal under consideration from the very paper that represents your vote. Our struggle is clear. To be relentlessly self-informed, and to be irrepressible participants in our democracy. \n\nDon't lose hope.

We expect to foster a conservative governing philosophy consisting of limited government and respect for traditional American virtues.** We expect a return on our investment.\"\n\nHer point was to say that the only thing her family was trying to buy was good government and conservative values. Which is the same thing that literally everyone who donates to a candidate or party wants, swapping in the relevant ideology, of course. If you didn't want to change government, you'd just give your money to charity.\n\nMost journalists try not to be blatant propagandists and instead focus on the truth. So the article continues:\n\n> To be fair, in that quote DeVos was referring to her wish for a conservative-dominated government...\n\n...so obviously he knew he was twisting her words, and felt a need to acknowledge that. But frankly, he shouldn't have done it in the first place. Butchering a quote and then explaining afterward that you butchered it is still delivering a false narrative. Many of the people who read that article are going to walk away remembering her as having claimed that her family unapologetically tries to trade cash for favors, even though that is not remotely what she said.",

Hillary: The Movie.\n\n> Hillary: The Movie is a 2008 political documentary about United States Senator and presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. It was produced by the conservative non-profit organization Citizens United. The film was scheduled to be offered as video-on-demand on cable TV right before the Democratic primaries in January 2008, but as \"electioneering communication\" to do so was illegal under the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act which was enforced by the Federal Election Commission. The producers went to U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia to get a declaration that they could show their movie and promotional ads for it despite BCRA. This case was titled Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission and its final decision at the U.S. Supreme Court resulted in a major change in campaign finance law.\n\nThis will not happen under Trump, obviously. ",

Usually this is accomplished through a SuperPAC, and the candidate is legally prohibited from coordinating with the SuperPAC. \n\nAnother recent ruling eliminates limits on aggregate donations from a single person to all recipients, so a new way to get a ton of money from one source is by splitting the donation between the candidate and state party committees to be aggregated back into a fund that supports a single candidate (the ways this can be spent are more strict than direct donations).

Now we are the fools in political dialogue. \n\nWe used to be a brilliant nation, leaping science forward and landing on the moon. Now we call scientists liars with agendas and nominate people who couldn't care less about education. \n\nWe used to be leaders in environmental policy. Now we deny climate change. \n\nWe used to march for civil rights. Now we are told protesters are whiners and more police presence will fix crime  \n\nWe used to be a lot of things in America, and looking at what it used to be, it's hard to believe it's the same nation. I'm proud of what our nation has accomplished, and I'm uncertain of what it'll be after all of this. \n\nEdit: thank you for the gold.

Both of us agree that a fascist government is bad but to them it is exactly what they want. It like how they call democrats \"Liberals\" like it is some dirty word but to us it is not a bad thing. When we call them fascist they hear our tone and know we are using it as an insult but they identify as a fascist and laugh it off the same we we do when they say liberal as an insult.\n\nWe need to stop assuming that everyone is still in agreement that fascism is a bad thing because everyone who was around during the rise of fascism is now dead or really old. No one remembers so now humanity is falling into its trap once more. \n\n",

The easiest way to do that is by taking the governorship of these states. It is imperative that they control the governors seat in at least these 7 states, and probably more where the congressional delegations are significantly out of whack with the historic national opinions of the states.\n\nFlorida - 16 Republican Congressman - 11 Democrats - 59.25% Republican - Last 5 presidential elections - 49.44% Republican\n\nNorth Carolina - 11 Republican Congressmen - 3 Democrats - 78.5% Republican - Last 5 presidential elections - 52.34% Republican\n\nGeorgia - 10 Republican Congressmen - 4 Democrats - 71.4% Republican - Last 5 presidential elections - 53.8% Republican\n\nOhio - 12 Republican Congressmen - 4 Democrats - 75% Republican - Last 5 presidential elections - 49.42% Republican\n\nMichigan - 9 Republican Congressmen - 5 Democrats - 64.2% Republican - Last 5 presidential elections - 45.42% Republican\n\nTexas - 25 Republican Congressmen - 11 Democrats - 69.4% Republican - Last 5 presidential elections - 57.06% Republican\n\nPennsylvania - 13 Republican Congressmen - 5 Democrats - 72.2% Republican - Last 5 presidential elections - 46.9% Republican\n\nJust taking these seven states, and realigning their districts to something closer to their popular vote, but STILL favoring the Republican party in each results in\n\nFL - 14 Rep - 13 Dem - +2 Seats (27*.4944=13.34)\n\nNC - 8 Rep - 6 Dem - + 3 Seats (14*.5234=7.33)\n\nGA - 8 Rep - 6 Dem - + 2 Seats (14*.538=7.53)\n\nOH - 8 Rep - 8 Dem - + 4 Seats (16*.4942=7.91)\n\nMI - 7 Rep - 7 Dem - + 2 Seats (14*.4542=6.35)\n\nTX - 21 Rep - 15 Dem - +4 Seats (36*.5706=20.54)\n\nPA - 9 Rep - 9 Dem - + 4 Seats (18*.469=8.44)\n\nThat is a total of 21 seats difference. Applying that to today's congress would put congress at a 220 R/215 D breakdown, and remember that every single one of these seven states had the number of seats for each party rounded up in favor of the Republicans (because as much as some of us might like to cut a member of congress into 3rds, we can't do that.) Rounding every state to the nearest whole number gives 4 more seats to the democrats (FL/NC/MI/PA) for a 219-216 majority.",
