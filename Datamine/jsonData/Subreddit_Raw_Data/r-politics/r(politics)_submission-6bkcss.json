Adam Kinzinger](https://twitter.com/RepKinzinger/status/864616139611152384) (R-IL):\n\n>These serious allegations effect our nat'l security & they carry very real consequences. It's time for Comey to testify before Congress.\n\n[Rep. Jason Chaffetz](https://twitter.com/jasoninthehouse/status/864616135466950656) (R-UT):\n\n>**GOP Oversight is going to get the Comey memo**, if it exists. I need to see it sooner rather than later. I have my subpoena pen ready.\n\n**UPDATE**: Chaffetz/Oversight [Letter to the FBI](https://twitter.com/BraddJaffy/status/864637761982271488)\n\n>Today, the New York Times reported former Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James Comey memorialized the content of phone calls and meetings with the President in a series of internal memoranda. At least one such memorandum reportedly describes a conversation in which the President referenced the FBI investigation of former National Security Advisor Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn and said to Comey, \"I hope you can let this go.\"\n\n>According to the report, \"Mr. Comey created similar memos \u2014 including some that are classified \u2014 about every phone call and meeting he had with the president.\" If true, these memoranda raise questions as to whether the President attempted to influence or impede the FBI's investigation as it relates to Lt. Gen. Flynn. So the Committee can consider that question, and others, provide, no later than May 24, 2017, all memoranda, notes, summaries, and recordings referring or relating to any communications between Comey and the President.\n\n>The Committee on Oversight and Government Reform is the principal oversight committee of the House of Representatives and may at \"any time\" investigate \"any matter\" as set forth in House Rule X. An attachment to this letter provides additional information about responding to the Committee's request. Thank you for your attention to this matter.\n\nSenator Angus King (I-ME) on [CNN](https://twitter.com/jimsciutto/status/864608774891474945):\n\n>Asked by Wolf Blitzer if Congress is getting closer to impeachment Senator Angus King (I-ME): **\"Reluctantly, Wolf, I have to say yes.\"**\n\nRep.

He continues to call for a select committee to investigate all aspects of Russia's inteference in the 2016 election and all of the events surrounding it.\n\nGov. John Kasich (R-OH), on CNN:\n\n>I don\u2019t like people who say I told you so, but you both know I was the one Repub who would not endorse Donald Trump\n\n>This is not a time for Republicans to hide, it\u2019s also not a time for Democrats to exploit\n\n>He's [Trump] in bigger trouble than losing his security clearance if we find out there were very serious problems\n\nSenator Richard Burr (R-NC), Senate Intelligence Chairman, per [Elana Schor](https://twitter.com/eschor/status/864599105502416897) of Politico:\n\n>I think the burden is on the New York Times, if they're reporting it and they've got somebody who's got the document.

In this post, he is talking about the most recent leak that Trump leaked classified information to the Russians:\n\n\"What sets this story apart for me, at least, is that I know one of the sources. And the source is solidly supportive of President Trump, or at least has been and was during Campaign 2016. But the President will not take any internal criticism, no matter how politely it is given. He does not want advice, cannot be corrected, and is too insecure to see any constructive feedback as anything other than an attack.\n\nSo some of the sources are left with no other option but to go to the media, leak the story, and hope that the intense blowback gives the President a swift kick in the butt. Perhaps then he will recognize he screwed up. The President cares vastly more about what the press says than what his advisers say. That is a real problem and one his advisers are having to recognize and use, even if it causes messy stories to get outside the White House perimeter.\"\n\nhttp://theresurgent.com/i-know-one-of-the-sources/",

Trump didn't ask/order him to stop the investigation, just \"hoped\" Comey would do so.\n3. The public doesn't care about these Washington \"process\" stories, and we should get back to what really matters.\n4. Trump is an outsider and inexperienced. This, the Comey firing and the \"inadvertent disclosure\" to the Russians yesterday are products of incompetence and nothing more.\n5. Why didn't Comey resign when this conversation allegedly happened? Maybe he wasn't acting honorably, wanted to hold on to his job. Why is this only coming out now?\n\n*The answer to (5) is clear. According to NYT article, the individuals who leaked the memo in response to taped conversation tweet - they feel that tapes will vindicate the memo.*\n\n6. Tucker Carlson is a moron. This is all a big conspiracy between the MSM and the \"leakers\" who simply don't like the President. I gotta stop, this is making my brain bleed. Oh, the Russians aren't that bad. Suddenly, the Russians are bad, and it all happened during a single election cycle. \n\n*Looks as like Tucker slept through the whole Crimea business, or Obama's frosty relationship with Moscow.*\n\nMost interesting is that 50 minutes into the broadcast, FNC can't find a *single* GOP Senator or Congressman willing to go on the air to defend the President, or comment in any way.\n\nFNC Congressional correspondent has called \"countless\" offices, can't find anyone to go on the air. He's also saying that nobody is even willing to make a comment.\n\nIs the RNC ready to defect, or is this a result of Republicans sticking their neck out to defend him on Comey firing/disclosures and then getting burned by Trump's admissions tweets?\n\nEDIT: Apparently, they *really* don't want to talk about it, per /u/funk_addict: https://twitter.com/rachaelmbade/status/864608676740554752\n\nJim Risch (R-ID) https://www.risch.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/contact : Claims he was a former prosecutor, if someone tried to kill his investigation, he'd scream bloody murder about it. Why didn't he report it? There's too much reliance on private sources. It would be illegal for Comey not to report if he thought it was obstruction of justice.\n\nTrey Gowdy (R-SC) https://gowdy.house.gov/contact : It's not fair to be coming to conclusions without seeing the whole memo and getting context from Comey. He's open to a special prosecutor, but thinks DOJ can do the job just fine without one. Comey did not have to report, even if he thought the President was trying to influence an investigation. ",

And I think that's actually really indicative of what's actually going on right now Anderson, House lawmakers just came back tonight from 11 day recess, they've been out of town, for most of these bombshell developments over the course of the last week and a half, and as they were walking onto the House floor, even the most talkative of members? Not answering questions. Not responding. Not commenting at all. Several, starting to get, really conveniently timed phone calls. All to avoid reporters. Now, this is a shift. Usually House Republicans have been pretty steadfast in supporting the President. That changed, tonight. Now Anderson I texted one member whose been reliably defensive of the President, and asked, what's going on? Why's everybody avoiding the reporters right now. And he responded simply, because this looks *really bad*. I asked him if he thought this was a 'game changing moment', for the Congress, for Republican support, he said, we'll see, it's too early to tell and now I will tell you Anderson, David made a really good point. Everybody has eyes on right now, senior members of the Republican Party. The Chairman. The leadership. What they'll have to say, and we've got, one kind of break from the norm, House Oversight Government Chairman Jason Chaffetz, just sent a letter to the FBI requesting, any memoranda, notes, memos, or recordings, between, uh, that summarize the conversations between FBI Director James Comey, and the President, he said he needs a response to that by May 24th, he's also stated, that he's willing to subpoena. Any documents he doesn't get, so you're already seeing, top Republicans, zeroing in on this, and other Republicans, just kind of, scared to death right now, Anderson. ",

The president did not have a clue that he was revealing highly classified information provided by an ally. Why not? Because, according to information from endless anonymous sources, Trump has no patience for detailed intelligence briefings and wants information boiled down to bullet points, preferably with pictures or graphics. He has no sense of what\u2019s classified and what\u2019s not. Information goes \u201cin one ear and out the mouth,\u201d as one exasperated official put it to Reuters. boasting is just what Trump does, whether it\u2019s a sensitive piece of intelligence or descriptions of his buildings, his golf clubs and the size of his electoral victory.\n\n> So what are the \u201cgrownups\u201d supposed to do? In his briefing today, General McMaster kept insisting that whatever the president shared with the Russians was \u201cwholly appropriate.\u201d Putting aside the pesky question of whether that sharing jeopardized U.S. relations with the unnamed ally who provided hard-won intelligence, what was McMaster and the other top aides supposed to do if they felt that sharing wasn\u2019t appropriate? Interrupt the president and change the subject? Wrestle him to the ground? Begin singing \u201cHail to the Chief\u201d loudly enough to drown out what Trump was saying?\n\nThe President is out of control, because statutorily nobody else can control or restrain him, because the Founders had a presumption that *we wouldn't fuck up as badly as we just fucked up.*\n\nBTW how fucking pathetic is it that the President accidentally blurting classified info to a geopolitical adversary is already old news superseded by even crazier shit.",
