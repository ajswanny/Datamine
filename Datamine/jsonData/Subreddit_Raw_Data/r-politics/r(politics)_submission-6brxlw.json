Several Bush aides (including Alberto Gonzalez) attempted to bypass Acting AG Comey and take advantage of Ashcroft's weakened state by going to his hospital room and essentially tricking him into signing a paper that would allow the warrantless wiretapping program to continue.  Comey got wind of it and rushed to the hospital room while Mueller, who was also rushing to the hospital, called Ashcroft's guards and told them not to let Comey be ejected under any circumstances.  As a result, the aides were forced to leave with the paper unsigned (although, in fairness, Ashcroft refused to sign it under his own power).\n\nComey's testimony of this incident is riveting, and can be watched [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxHjWYA50Ds&t)",

Mueller III and raced, sirens blaring, to join Ashcroft in his hospital room, arriving minutes before Gonzales and Card. Ashcroft, summoning the strength to lift his head and speak, refused to sign the papers they had brought. Gonzales and Card, who had never acknowledged Comey's presence in the room, turned and left.\n\n> The sickbed visit was the start of a dramatic showdown between the White House and the Justice Department in early 2004 that, according to Comey, was resolved only when Bush overruled Gonzales and Card. But that was not before Ashcroft, Comey, Mueller and their aides prepared a mass resignation, Comey said. The domestic spying by the National Security Agency continued for several weeks without Justice approval, he said.\n\n",

The following year he took charge of its criminal division. During his tenure, he oversaw prosecutions that included Panamanian leader **Manuel Noriega**, the **Pan Am Flight 103** (Lockerbie bombing) case, and the **Gambino crime family boss John Gotti**.\n\n* The vote on the Senate floor on August 2, 2001 [to confirm him as Director of the FBI], **passed unanimously, 98\u20130**. He served as Acting Deputy Attorney General of the United States Department of Justice for several months, before officially becoming the FBI Director on September 4, 2001, just one week before the September 11 attacks against the United States.\n\n* Director Mueller, along with Deputy Attorney General James B. Comey, **offered to resign from office** in March 2004 if the White House overruled a Department of Justice finding that domestic wiretapping without a court warrant was unconstitutional. Attorney General John D. Ashcroft denied his consent to attempts by White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card and White House Counsel Alberto R. Gonzales to waive the Justice Department ruling and permit the domestic warrantless eavesdropping program to proceed. On March 12, 2004, President George W. Bush gave his support to changes in the program sufficient to satisfy the concerns of Mueller, Ashcroft and Comey. The extent of the National Security Agency's domestic warrantless eavesdropping under the President's Surveillance Program is still largely unknown.\n\nLooks like we might have found our man.

Vietnam volunteer (Marine Corps Officer), public service basically ever since his stint in 'Nam as a prosecutor and then US attorney and then finally FBI director...a  job Obama asked him to stay on for even though his term had expired.\n\nRosenstein has proven, at this late hour, that my original faith in America was right. The system can work. Thank God. Thank God. Thank God.\n\nSincerely,\n\nA proud American.",

He was just a sad pathetic nobody, how was he supposed to answer them? How was he supposed to know? As he expelled more and more bullshit his jaw began to feel numb. He had felt this before, but when? It was familiar. Had this happened yesterday? Or a week ago?\nOr a thousand lifetimes ago?\n\nHis eyes crossed. His vision went blurry. This was it. His punishment was finally over. He was finally free.\n\nHe awoke to the same nightmare he had lived a thousand times before. The date on his phone read January 20th. Was this another dream?

Pretty emotional testimony involving Bush White House officials attempting to force a barely conscious/hospitalized AG Ashcroft to sign off on paperwork permitting domestic spying. Mueller played a pretty significant role. Comey:\n\n>So I hung up the phone, immediately called my chief of staff, told him to get as many of my people as possible to the hospital immediately. I hung up, called Director Mueller and -- with whom I'd been discussing this particular matter and had been a great help to me over that week -- and told him what was happening. He said, \"I'll meet you at the hospital right now.\"\n\n...\n\n>I went out in the hallway. Spoke to Director Mueller by phone. He was on his way. I handed the phone to the head of the security detail and Director Mueller instructed the FBI agents present not to allow me to be removed from the room under any circumstances. And I went back in the room.\n\nedit... a stab at a tldr of a very complex situation, since people are asking:\n\nIn 2004 the Bush White House (GW, Andrew Card, Alberto Gonzales) attempted to get Attorney General John Ashcroft, barely conscious in the hospital, to re-approve a domestic spying program which at the time needed the AGs periodic re-authorization and which he and Deputy Attorney General James Comey had previously deemed unlawful and were prepared not to re-authorize. Shortly after Comey and Ashcroft decided not to re-authorize, Ashcroft fell very ill. While AG Ashcroft was in the hospital Comey was serving as acting AG, but Card and Gonzales attempted to use Ashcroft's delirium to get him to approve it anyway. Comey and FBI Director Mueller showed up and successfully denied Card and Gonzales success until Ashcroft came to and excoriated them, telling them that Comey was the acting AG and that he agreed the spying program was unlawful, anyway. Mueller, Comey, and most of the top echelon of the Justice Dept. prepared resignations, but in the end some ended up staying and after a lengthy and complicated process the president authorized the warrantless wiretapping without them. Soon Alberto Gonzales became the next Attorney General.",

Except as provided in this part, the Special Counsel shall determine whether and to what extent to inform or consult with the Attorney General or others within the Department about the conduct of his or her duties and responsibilities.\n\nSection 600.7 (d) allows only the Attorney General to fire the Special Counsel, and says that he may do so for misconduct or \"other good cause\":\n\n>\u00a7 600.7 Conduct and accountability.\n\n>(a) A Special Counsel shall comply with the rules, regulations, procedures, practices and policies of the Department of Justice. He or she shall consult with appropriate offices within the Department for guidance with respect to established practices, policies and procedures of the Department, including ethics and security regulations and procedures. Should the Special Counsel conclude that the extraordinary circumstances of any particular decision would render compliance with required review and approval procedures by the designated Departmental component inappropriate, he or she may consult directly with the Attorney General.\n\n>(b) The Special Counsel shall not be subject to the day-to-day supervision of any official of the Department. However, the Attorney General may request that the Special Counsel provide an explanation for any investigative or prosecutorial step, and may after review conclude that the action is so inappropriate or unwarranted under established Departmental practices that it should not be pursued. In conducting that review, the Attorney General will give great weight to the views of the Special Counsel. If the Attorney General concludes that a proposed action by a Special Counsel should not be pursued, the Attorney General shall notify Congress as specified in \u00a7 600.9(a)(3).\n\n>(c) The Special Counsel and staff shall be subject to disciplinary action for misconduct and breach of ethical duties under the same standards and to the same extent as are other employees of the Department of Justice. Inquiries into such matters shall be handled through the appropriate office of the Department upon the approval of the Attorney General.\n\n>(d) The Special Counsel may be disciplined or removed from office only by the personal action of the Attorney General. The Attorney General may remove a Special Counsel for misconduct, dereliction of duty, incapacity, conflict of interest, or for other good cause, including violation of Departmental policies. The Attorney General shall inform the Special Counsel in writing of the specific reason for his or her removal.\n\nSource: https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/28/part-600",

The popular backlash was so massive that Nixon was eventually forced to resign.  So Trump know that *could* happen if he does the same... but he might be forced to try it anyway because he has no other choice.\n\nOf course, Nixon by the time he fired two AGs probably already had assurances from Ford that he would pardon him, and indeed, it's quite likely that he agreed to appoint Ford *only* on the condition that he would do so.

However, I do have one gripe. And it is a big one. \n\nJonah Hill's performance as Trump was just not stupid enough. While Mr. Hill has proven himself a dramatic powerhouse with last year's *The Postman Only Rings Twice* reboot and I can see why he wouldn't want to lower himself to the base levels one must function at to portray Donald Trump. As we all know, a competent Trump is not a believable Trump. The way he meticulously crafts his tweets are simply not authentic to those of us who were young enough to be paying attention during that tumultuous time in our country. \n\nOn the other hand Jake Gyllenhaal's performance as James Comey was excellent and moving. I personally applaud his dedication to the role by electing to have height enhancement surgery to properly portray the former FBI Director and 47th president. \n\nI understand my opinion is in the minority. And you will likely see *Orange Crush* in many top ten lists at the end of 2045.\"",
