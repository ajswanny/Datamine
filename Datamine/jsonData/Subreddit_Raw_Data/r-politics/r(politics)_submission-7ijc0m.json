    "body": "I am very liberal and hate on Trump as much as anyone, but I have a genuine question. When did \"going in for a kiss\" become sexual harassment, the same sexual harassment that is used to describe people that grope coworkers or make inappropriate sexual comments to subordinates? I understand no one should be coerced into doing something against their desires, romantically, sexually, or otherwise. However, it feels like basic gestures are now considered harassment, including trying to kiss someone after something you perceived to be a date.\n\nWhose first kiss with a romantic partner was overtly consensual? Did I miss the decision that you must explicitly ask your date for consent before attempting a normal kiss, and if you don't, you are a sex offender or have to resign your job? People make reads and sometimes they are wrong. She declined the kiss, their lives went on no worse for wear. I am genuinely curious if the first time people kiss on a date, they ask for permission like, \"I would like to kiss you, is that ok?\" and \"Yes, you may kiss me\". Maybe they do, and the zeitgeist has changed from when people took a chance and got turned down or not.\n\nAnyway, I just feel like there are plenty of actual sexual offenses by Trump, or anyone, that can be attacked, and that attempting a kiss a single time that gets turned down is awkward, but not sexual harassment. Like I said, perhaps that is an outdated opinion.\n\nEdit: I am trying to respond to everyone, but I think there are some important details that are being assumed, rather than basing your judgement on the information presented in the article.\n\n1) He may not have been married yet, as per the article. The uncertainty of when the event happened makes this criticism difficult at this time (a 2-year range is very broad). \n\n2) It does not say if it was a professional setting, a casual lunch, or a combination. Workplace romances can and do happen, so that idea is not completely impossible, nor does it appear he was using his position to coerce her, from the information in the article. \n\n3) Yes he was in power. No that doesn't make everything he does exploitation of power. He made a move, it got turned down, that was it. He didn't keep trying, he didn't badger her after, as far as we know.",

There are things that happened to me when I was a young girl that felt like a bell was going off right in my ear, yet I felt the need to act like nothing was happening. Like nothing was wrong. Those are the things that make me livid at myself and at the world around me for allowing those things to happen to me when I was too young to understand. \n\nSo part of it is an age thing. Another part is not. This shit still happens to me even now at an older age, and sometimes I don't really realize what's happening or don't see it for what it is until hours, maybe even days later. Why? Because I (and you, and everyone else) has been conditioned to accept this behavior as \"normal\". \n\nThe big problem with rape culture is that it's so strong and pervasive that it is normalized. That's why a bunch of people in Alabama don't see Roy Moore as a pedophile -- they see him as a man who dated high schoolers and what the hell is wrong with that. We have to remember that 40 years ago it was absolutely cool for a man to spank a woman at work just because he felt like it. That in the 90's it was still legal in most states to rape your wife. \n\nSo I get that this woman, when she was a bit younger, when she was caught by surprise, wasn't offended right away. And I understand why she is now. The shock of someone taking you, grabbing you, forcing himself upon you, even just for a kiss...it's a lot. For some people it takes time to finally hear that voice in the back of their heads that's screaming \"what that person did to me was not ok\". \n\nWhatever. I'm drunk and rambling. Anyway, hope that explanation helps. I think there's a lot of things that women know and understand (that we have known, understood, and experienced for centuries if not millennia) that men are just becoming aware of thanks to these brave women (and men) coming forward. This woman's story is one of those things that resonates with my by virtue of having existed on this earth for a couple of decades with an X chromosome, but I can understand why inherent contradiction in her words seems strange to others. \n",

I wasn\u2019t offended, I was kind of like, \u2018Oh my god.'\u201d\n\nSo she was expecting a kiss on the cheek, but instead he attempted to kiss her on the lips, which isn't professional.\n\nAs for your dating example, that's different, because it's in the context of dating. Yeah, you might move in for a kiss on a date and get declined, but it's expected in that atmosphere. You give it a shot, and maybe it's too soon, or the feeling isn't reciprocated. If you were to attempt to force the kiss after being turned down, *then* that would be sexual assault/harassment. \n\nIf you meet someone professionally, you wouldn't kiss them on the lips.

Especially in the GOP's current state of affairs, all of their clamoring would have been easily dismissed by a \"Remove the pedophilic and predatory planks from your party before complaining about a speck in ours\".\n\n[EDIT](http://www.cnn.com/2017/12/06/politics/al-franken-democratic-senators-resign/index.html):\n> \"Thirty-two Democratic senators -- 13 female and 19 male -- called on Franken to resign as allegations of sexual harassment against him continue to mount.
