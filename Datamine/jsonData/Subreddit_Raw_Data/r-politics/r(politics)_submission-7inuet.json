The Internet must remain a true democracy - where all voices can be equal. The Internet must remain a place where an entrepreneur can bring a new idea and have a chance at greatness. Net Neutrality protects the free and open internet by preventing ISPs from blocking, speeding up or slowing down the transmission of content, or increasing costs to consumers by changing the pricing model that exists today. Chairman Pai is a threat to the greatness of this country, and his plan to dismantle the freedom of the Internet must be stopped. Thank you.\nYour consituent",

(I'm a bot)\n*****\n> WASHINGTON - Days before the Federal Communications Commission will vote on its proposed rollback of Net Neutrality rules that protect the open internet, Representative Sean Patrick Maloney introduced the Save Net Neutrality Act to stop the FCC&#039;s Notice of Proposed Rulemaking that would result in a final rule eliminating the existing Net Neutrality policy.\n\n> The FCC offered an NPRM on May 18, 2017 which would rollback Net Neutrality rules established by the Commission in 2015.\n\n> The Save Net Neutrality Act would simply prevent the FCC from relying on the NPRM process that will conclude with a final vote on December 14th. The bill refrains from making policy prescriptions, but instead invalidates the process that culminates in the creation of an enforceable rule authorized by the APA. Without the ability to rely on the rule, the FCC would have to start the NPRM process over from scratch.\n\n\n*****\n[**Extended Summary**](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/7iocgg/maloney_introduces_legislation_to_save_the_open/) | [FAQ](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/31b9fm/faq_autotldr_bot/ \"Version 1.65, ~262580 tl;drs so far.\") | [Feedback](http://np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23autotldr \"PM's and comments are monitored, constructive feedback is welcome.\") | *Top* *keywords*: **rule**^#1 **Neutrality**^#2 **Net**^#3 **FCC**^#4 **process**^#5",

I\u2019m putting a foot across the isle for this one until it inevitably turns into a non-partisan issue. \n\nAlso I want to comment on the comical irony of carriers position on this.

Congress ratified and the president signed the UN Charter, making it a supreme law of the land. The UN Charter states that resolutions passed by the Security Council are binding for all member states. The Security Council passed a resolution saying that Israel\u2019s law declaring Jerusalem \u201cin its entirety\u201d is the \u201ceternal capital\u201d is illegal. Congress in the 90\u2019s under Clinton passed a law to move our embassy to Jerusalem and recognize it as the capital of Israel. Clinton wasn\u2019t impeached for signing it, nor were any of the GOP or Democratic Congress members impeached for it. Trump just made a unconstitutional move to act on the law, and he isn\u2019t being impeached for it. \n\nRemoving a sitting member of Congress by force is extraordinarily difficult, it\u2019s not a thing that just happens.",

The folly of the \"keep voting Democratic\" strategy was clearly demonstrated in the 2016 election, when the major parties, in their race to the bottom, offered us a choice between Hillary or Donald. Clearly, throughout the primaries, Bernie was the only Democratic candidate who could consistently beat any Republican challenger, but the entrenched Democratic plutocrats would demonstrably rather lose the election than support a candidate who genuinely represented the will of the party's ostensible constituency (their real constituency, of course, being their big campaign donors). The tragedy is that they successfully denied the voters the candidate of their choice, foisting Hillary on them in a mockery of a primary.\n\nIn their allegiance to their mega-donors the parties are, indeed, identical. Their difference, therefore, lies in the philosophies of those plutocrats: Currently America is denying poor children school lunches and putting old people out on the street to pay for tax cuts to billionaires, while under the previous administration it had other priorities. Under Bernie's administration, we would have advanced education at all levels, decreased domestic poverty, provided healthcare for everyone, enriched the middle and lower classes, and taken steps toward making America great again, to borrow a phrase. Obviously, these things were part of neither party's agenda, otherwise we would have a President Sanders today. Worse, as the government becomes more secretive, authoritarian, and militaristic, the likelihood of even being offered a genuine populist candidate again is rapidly diminishing.\n\nThe government's propaganda mills are calling Trump a \"populist,\" and Reagan a \"neoliberal,\" for crying out loud! As if Trump ever cared a rat's back end about anyone with a net worth below a million, or there was anything \"liberal\" about Reaganomics. I'm sorry, but it looks to me like America is terminally screwed. Props to all those sleazy shysters on Capitol Hill (or as I like to call it, \"Bullshit Mountain\"). It looks like they've won.\n",
