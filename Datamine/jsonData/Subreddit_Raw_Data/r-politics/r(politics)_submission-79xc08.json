There was a weird respite during the 2008 election, when they briefly seemed cowed by Obama's demographic-transcending popularity. But after Obama was inaugurated it kicked back into high gear. \n\nIt was never as bad as yesterday. Never. Even my Republican relative described it as \"it's like they're putting their fingers in their ears and screaming 'la-la-la I can't hear you.'\"\n\nFox has lost nearly 20% of their advertising revenue over the last year, but they've apparently chalked that up to not being slavish enough to Trump. When Don Jr. is arrested expect to see Juanita Broaddrick and Monica Lewinsky splashed all over FoxNews.",

The politicians become dependent on the paper to promote them and their policies, the rank-and-file read and trust the paper, and thus the newspaper owner can do things like target unfriendly members of the party for negative coverage, or refuse to promote one of the party's stances.\n\nRupert Murdoch took this to the UK, where his scummy papers became the mouthpieces of the Conservative party, giving him that kind of power within the party and broadly over UK politics.\n\nHe teamed up with long-time Republican media strategist Roger Ailes to specifically create Fox News as the propaganda arm of the Republican party apparatus.  This would promote the party, coordinate talking points with the politicians, make Murdoch money, but also give him enormous power within the party.\n\nTrump realizes that his only hope is to keep up his \"ratings\" with the Republican base so he needs Murdoch/Fox News.  We are seeing this week how Murdoch is going to bat for Trump across his various outlets (including a really stupid editorial by the Wall Street Journal editor board promoting Hillary-Uranium, claiming the Steele Dossier is nothing but \"Russian disinformation\" and calling for Mueller's resignation for no reason other than that he worked with Comey in the past.)

    "body": "> It also implies that our generation is dumb and doesn't realize that the plastic medal everyone gets is less of an honor than the giant trophies the championship winners get.\n\nSeriously. I was on my school's basketball team. We went to the championship against our rival the last year most of the team (9 guys were graduating)  would be there. We lost in overtime, in the luckiest bullshit shot literally at the buzzer I've ever seen. They gave us our second place tropies, and one guy took it, walked away, and threw it down and broke it. None of us smiled in the pic they took of our team for the local news paper. We were pissed. We wanted to WIN. Our consolation prize trophy was bullshit and we all knew it. \n\nLooking back as an adult at the trophies I got in the various teams I played on, I see them fondly, as memories of my childhood. I remember the some of the games, some of the other players. I have trophies for teams that were dead last, and one team where we won the championship. I feel more pride in the championship trophy, but I am fond of all of them, as they are reminders of a special time of my life that's gone now. God forbid we give children something to remember, something to remind them, of their early years. No, that's for winners only...\n\nTL;DR, yes all kids get trophies, but they aren't the same trophy, and in the end they serve as keepsakes from our innocent years.\n\nADDED Jesus Christ people, I was writing about the feelings of a bunch of 13 year olds who had just lost the championship game, for most they last game they'd play as a team, I really don't want to hear critiques of how a bunch of 8th graders were \"too disappointed\" in losing a championship game immediately after it happened. The virtue police are really friggin annoying...",

Those of us born from like 79-85 since we came of age in a crazy transitional time for tech. Computers and technology were starting to become more ubiquitous as kids, but during our childhood it wasn't common for *everyone* you knew to have a home computer. We had a home PC in the late 80s, but I don't remember any of my friends or other kids having one at home when I was that young. I happened to have a parent who was a tech writer specializing in software, so we always had a computer. But most kids I knew were lucky to have an old Atari or NES.\n\nAnd those of us who did have home computers in the late 80s/early 90s weren't likely to have an internet connection until the mid 90s. So yeah we played computer games like Oregon Trail and Number Munchers, and had some computer classes at school, but we also still learned how to use a library card catalog system and did our research projects the old school way with encyclopedias and books at the library.\n\nWhich makes us like half Gen X and half Millennial. We can remember a time without the internet, and remember how shitty early internet was. But we also had enough early exposure to technology as kids/teens that we're comfortable with it and excel at using it. I'm with you though. I certainly don't feel like a Millennial at 33. I have things in common with both Gen Xers and Millennials, but don't feel like I'm part of either generation. Oregon Trail Generation it is.\n\nEdit: it's number munchers, not crunchers. Doy.",

    "body": "Lets break some of this bullshit down shall we?\n\n>  It is examining issues\u2014like Donald Trump\u2019s private business transactions\u2014that are far removed from the Russian question. \n\nFalse. If Trump has business interests that might make him vulnerable to influence, even if these transactions happened 30 years ago they are relevant. So false statement #1 in this piece about 3 paragraphs in.\n\n>  and from leaks suggesting that Mr. Trump\u2019s firing of FBI Director James Comey might have \u201cobstructed\u201d justice.\nThat claim is frivolous, and it damages America\u2019s constitutional fabric even to consider it. A president cannot obstruct justice through the exercise of his constitutional and discretionary authority over executive-branch officials like Mr. Comey. \n\nWhat the fuck is this utter nonsense? He **can** fire Comey sure, but he **also can** be obstruction justice to do so. That friends is against the law. How the fuck is this type of nonsensical moronic argument even allowed to pass an editors desk? It is just a false argument on it's face.\n\n> . If a president can be held to account for \u201cobstruction of justice\u201d by ending an investigation or firing a prosecutor or law-enforcement official\u2014an authority the constitution vests in him as chief executive\u2014then one of the presidency\u2019s most formidable powers is transferred from an elected, accountable official to unelected, unaccountable bureaucrats and judges.\n\nWTF is this moronic shit? The POTUS isn't above the law. I know the WSJ thinks the POTUS can do whatever he likes (as long as he's a Republican of course), but this ain't how it works.\n\n> Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigation has been widely interpreted as partisan from the start.\n\nFalse. Mueller is one of the most respected folks in law enforcement alive today and trusted by both sides. (Except for hacks like Newt who loved him until the second he heard Trumps money was going to get looked at, then Newt knew Trump was fucked, and now hates him. But Newt cheats on all of his wives so his ethical opinion doesn't matter anyway).\n\n> Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters count the number of Democratic donors on the special-counsel staff.\n\nThey donate to both parties. Trump donated to the Clintons. This argument is moronic and has no relevance.\n\n> Mr. Trump can end this madness by immediately issuing a blanket presidential pardon to anyone involved in supposed collusion with Russia or Russians during the 2016 presidential campaign, to anyone involved with Russian acquisition of an American uranium company during the Obama administration, and to anyone for any offense that has been investigated by Mr. Mueller\u2019s office.\n\nThis is batshit insane nonsense. I like to apply the \"Clinton Test\" to this type of thinking. Would the GOP allow Hillary to do this if she was POTUS? Fuck no.\n\n> Permitting the criminal law again to become a regular weapon in politics is more destructive of democratic government than ham-handed efforts by a foreign power to embarrass one or more presidential candidates.\n\nTranslation: We know Trump is in some serious deep shit because he's been a corrupt idiotic asshole for decades and is too stupid to cover up his crimes, but now that the big dogs are actually investigating him, he's toast. We can't have that, we want our fucking tax cuts.",
