Ajit Pai isn't going going to take the time to print it out to wipe his ass with. \n\nYou'll have better luck contacting your reps in congress about it. You can find them and their contact information at this website. https://www.congress.gov/members\n\nYou can find your senate members here. https://www.senate.gov/senators/contact/\n\nAlso, don't forget this isn't entirely up to Pai. It takes a 3 vote majority of the 5 member committee to go through. \n\nYou can find those 5 members here. https://www.fcc.gov/about/leadership\n\nA quick breakdown: \n\nPai of course. His vote will be to approve the repeal. \n\nMignon Clyburn. One of the people who first voted to approve net neutrality. \n\nMichael O'Rielly. One of the people who first voted against net neutrality when it was passed. He's the key. It's him we need to approach. His contact information is on the website. I urge you all to email, fax, and call his offices. \n\n\nBrendan Carr. Hand picked by Trump to back up Pai in repealing net neutrality. He's also worked for ISPs in the past. Smaller chance of him vote against the repeal, but it wouldn't hurt to contact him as well. \n\nJessica Rosenworcel, another democrat, and the other person of currently on the council who voted for net neutrality. \n\nContact these people. Let them know how you feel. We're not going to sway Pai; we might sway the others. ",

The democrats fought and fought against the republicans to protect net neutrality, and then people voted for republicans to control every branch of the government. And now, instead of recognizing the real problem here, everyone is eager to blame this one unelected guy, instead of the president, congress, and senate who appointed and empowered him to enact their agenda. \n\nThe only reason we even know this guy's name is because the non-voters and republican voters here on reddit can't defend their decision to allow an all-republican government and so destroy net neutrality. So we get this false narrative that the problem is just this rogue guy.\n\nIt's one thing to try and treat the symptoms of a problem instead of the root cause. It's another thing when the treatments for the symptom have no fucking chance in hell of working, and yet there's a clear and effective treatment for the root cause that is being ignored.",

But just like this seems to be a pet peeve of yours, your comment triggered a pet peeve of my own.\n\nBetween this and Battlefront and most things anti-Trump related on Reddit, I see so many comments along the lines of \u2018you\u2019re fooling yourself if you think you\u2019re doing any good here\u2019. In a sense, these comments are 100% correct. There could be a bajillion signatures and Pai wouldn\u2019t lose a second of sleep. EA will likely give lip service and a consolation prize just large enough to make people forget for a while.\n\nBut perfect is the enemy of good, and all things have to start somewhere. Discouraging people from the outset stomps the kindling before it has a chance to spark. It\u2019s like belittling people from the Phillipines from protesting against Duerte: \u201cdo you really think Duerte is going to care if a hundred peasants go to the streets?\u201d. Hell no. But if he ignores them and people see it\u2019s acceptable to voice their opinions, more people will do so. If he cracks down, then a hundred angry protestors suddenly turns into 100 FAMILIES personally impacted by his actions. That is how dissent grows. Fatalism kills it in its tracks, and results in the norm remaining the norm.\n\nI don\u2019t mean to pick on you here because your point is valid. But please consider this.",

I would be overjoyed that the rubes of reddit have come together to blame Ajit Pai (who we have no leverages of control over) vs the Republicans who appointed him (who we absolutely have leverages of control over.)\n\nBlaming Ajit Pai is like blaming a Walmart district manager for Walmart not offering healthcare to its employees. Ajit Pai being the net neutrality scapegoat is the best of all possible outcomes for the republicans, comcast, and even Ajit Pai. He's being a fucking hero to his republican bosses and corporate backers, who are going to get away with this scott free.\n\nTo use your Duerte analogy, this would be like if a hundred people angry about Duerte's actions got tricked into going out and protesting Duerte's secretary instead of him.

Similarly, to pull off a massive boycott of the ISPs, we'd want people to create spaces for wifi use during the campaign.

    "body": "The real problem is that monopolies are a natural consequence of a free and open market, and we already know that because we already had to write the anti-trust laws that block them from happening. Since we already have effective ISP monopolies in much of the country they need to be regulated like monopolies, i.e., like utilities. Which brings us back to the problem of rolling back Title II classification which allows the FCC to enforce Net Neutrality rules.",
