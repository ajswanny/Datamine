    "body": "A lot of medium articles are random bullshit, but that one was legitimately informative and he ties it all together nicely. \n\nThe DHS ignoring that court order was, I think, the first sign that people screaming \"fascism!\" weren't just being paranoid. First meaningful one anyway, because it exposed how weak our institutions actually are. Something you can be damn sure Trump and Bannon will take advantage of. They have the security services on their side, evidently. CBP and the DHS clearly don't have any concern for the constitution or congress. \n\nThough of course we shouldn't be surprised. They never did. CBP in particular has been violating constitutional rights in the name of deporting your abuela without fair trial for years. Shit like Operation Streamline should have been a wake up call to people in American society about how far their government will go and how little the constitution actually matters on the ground. \n\nYour rights have always hung by a thread. The constitution doesn't protect them, a social contract does.  In essence, you have \"freedom\" because people in the state have come to an agreement that you should. If they decide to break that contract they can and will rob you of your rights. And there isn't much you can do about it. You can't exactly sue them..\n\nThing about people like Bannon that is not understood as well as it should be, the guy is not a republican. He is not even a conservative. Conservatives in the US have at least some respect for the American system of liberal democracy. Bannon considers liberal democracy to be a threat to the survival of white Christians. \n\nThe more I read up on Bannon the less he seems like some sort of chaotic evil and the more I recognize what he actually is, which is a fascist in an actual ideological sense. He believes the role of the state is to safeguard the cultural and racial purity of the west. This means a society dominated by Christianity and that uses extreme violence to crush every other group in the world. He's a believer in Sam Huntington's \"clash of civilizations\" bullshit down to a T, as well as Leo Strauss's view of ideological diversity leading to the decline of civilization. \n\nEssentially he thinks we all need to be forced at gunpoint into a particular way of life that people like him (surprise surprise) decide for us, and that diversity is a death sentence for humanity. \n\nThis is, not coincidentally I think, the exact same sort of state and outlook that Hitler described in Mein Kampf. \n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V%C3%B6lkisch_movement\n\nBannon is a Christian dominionist, an exceedingly violent person in his views on human life itself, and a person who derides the very possibility of common humanity. \n\nHe also has no regard for the legitimacy of the state and therefore has no problem breaking its laws. He sees himself as a revolutionary. And indeed, in a fucked up way he kind of is. \n\nThis might all seem terrifying. That's because it is terrifying. But in a way if we understand Bannon and his ilk we can fight them better. \n\nFor one, Bannon's strategy relies on what Naomi Klein called \"shock therapy\". Basically, overwhelming the public with a deluge of actions that short circuit their ability to meaningfully resist, that take advantage or manufacture crises in order to shut down dissent or make opposition irrelevant, and the use of rhetoric and propaganda that is more about shutting down all conversation with incoherent madness than it is about spreading a particular belief (Breitbart is a prime example). \n\nAnother part of this, be forewarned, is the extensive use of violence to destroy civil society and crush the voices of people offering an alternative. \n\nAll of this is meant to happen at once, which indeed, it is. \n\nBut since we can understand what he's doing and why it gives us the ability to undermine it. He's going to try to overwhelm us. We need to create our own shocks. \n\nActivists need to be willing to engage in civil disobedience more than just protesting. They need to find very clear targets and disrupt things. Force a response from the state that undermines its narrative. Put them on the spot constantly. If them or their supporters give speeches disrupt those speeches. If they have a meeting attempt to ruin it. If they make a deal with a private business go to their headquarters and cause a ruckus. If they start rounding up illegal immigrants head over the detention center and start climbing the fence. \n\nProtesters need to be living proof that the power these people have is actually totally illusory, and that the kind of hegemony Bannon desires is totally impossible. We're a diverse society. We need to make connections with people outside of our neighborhoods. If Bannon wants a black and white world give him a rainbow instead. \n\nTheir every waking moment needs to be dogged by the understanding that on the street they will never have the consent of the people, and that their authority is going to be actively subverted at every possible moment. \n\nThey'll try to crush you, believe me they will. People will go to jail. They'll be beaten up by the cops. You'll be demonized by the media, some of you might even get killed if this fucker really wants to go down the same route as Nixon and start using the national guard to break up student demonstrations. \n\nIt can't be enough for you to protest, you need to create a spectacle. One that throws a wrench in the machinery and forces people to realize the existence of dissent. \n\nThey're going to try to shock us. \n\nWe all need to shock them. \n\nPeople like Steve Bannon believe state violence can crush any and all resistance. He's an intelligent fucker, but at the end of the day he's just another boneheaded fascist.Remember that and you'll learn how easy it is to deligitimize somebody who's entire ideology comes down to mindless violence",

Well, you've obviously never heard Bannon speak about Christian Ethnostates and how the Judeo Christians are losing all they've been bequeathed.

Military-grade tear-gas. Cops firing tear-gas grenades directly at protesters. (lady in TADP protest lost her arm due to a flash-bang grenade), Rubber bullets. (kent-state: \"whoops?

It does not cause any physical damage, though one test subject did receive blisters.  I think this has been fielded in Afghanistan, but I'm not sure if the international community is going to accept it's use against civil protesters.  It may be that in Bannon's USA, the opinions of the international community won't matter.\n\n\nWhat has happened to protesters in other countries (2008 and later): Vehicles directly running over crowds of protesters (Egypt), Snipers giving head-shots to protesters (Ukraine) (and it's not clear whether these were government forces, foreign agents, or just rednecks who opposed the protesters; because whoever did it, they got away with it clean).

But disruptive protest, especially of the kind that are ongoing and constant, makes it impossible for the state to spread its narrative effectively. And the more it escalates the more that state will undermine itself\n\nBut like I said, it's important to choose the right targets. Protesting in the same place every week might be well and good, but it won't mean much. Effective civil disobedience requires a knowledge of symbolism. Choosing when/where to strike is as important as how you do it. People shouldn't do anything unless they are positive they will gain some sort of victory by it. \n\nThe major considerations are such\n\nA) Does the target represent something about the broader power structure\n\nB) What can we do to disrupt its ability to function normally\n\nC) What will the response of the government be\n\nIn the case of \"C\" you should try to do things that get them to react in ways that are, to put not to fine a sheen on it, horrible. MLK's actions in the civil rights movement were about provoking police into attacking innocent people in large part. \n\nIdeally you should try to put your opponent in an unwinnable situation where they either escalate the unrest on the streets or they cave and give in to your demands.

When it felt like his performance in the debates was probably going to tank him, a new story would come up and the news would be about that. \n\nI'm still amazed as to how he got elected, but I guess when you hear the other side's reasons of wanting someone who wasn't the status quo politician, was a fresh face, would drain the swamp, would build a wall, would block Muslims, etc. and then actually do that shit rather than have Hillary Clinton, the poster child for the status quo, it starts to make sense. Plus when you couple in how unenthusiastic the average voter probably was for Clinton in swing or non-swing states, the surprise of election night doesn't look like much of a surprise.\n\nBut yeah, it really feels like that speed of new story after new story circulating Trump is still the status quo for Trump. It seems that the main story is still the Muslim ban, but ones you don't hear about are this Bannon stuff, articles about some of his picks not even seeing the final drafts of Trump's executive orders, etc. Makes you wonder what happens when it finally starts to slow down or when this theory would actually become a reality.

New voting laws were written to target voters who would vote against them. and make it harder for poor minority voters or urban voters to get to the polls.\n\nStage 3, what we're seeing now, is when you've actually gained power and now you have to begin dismantling the checks and balances that stop you from doing what you want. This was the goal of Republicans in blocking Obama's SCOTUS nominations. They want to make sure the checks and balances are being run by *their* man, not someone else's. \n\n(Edit: I just woke up from a nap and saw they fired the acting attorney general for refusing to enforce their unconstitutional executive order. Well fuck.)\n\nStage 4 is de facto removal of opposition parties. That's what the outgoing N. Carolina Republicans tried to pull when they realized Dems had just gained control of the state, by gutting the Dems power to effectively govern at all. Unfortunately for them they hadn't finished Stage 3 and the courts told them to fuck off. ",

My guess (and it's as good as any, in this matter) is that it would end up being bought by Surgutneftegaz, a major Russian oil/gas company, where many believe Putin is the ultimate beneficiary owner. Again - same deal - VTB finances the purchase of 19% stake, lending money to some shelf corps, then the shares get passed around a few times until an end buyer surfaces; in the meantime all the intermediaries are wiped and lost.\n\nWe have seen similar things in Russia, where shortly after a consortium of international banks declined to provide purchase financing to a subsidiary of Gazprom (Gazprom Neft) for the purchase of YuganskNefteGaz (YUKOS) at an auction, after it was seized by Russia from Mikhail Khodorkovsky. On the same day that a judge in Houston issued a freeze order on all YUKOS assets, BaikalFinansGroup, a company with ~400 USD capital (that's four hundred dollars, just to be clear) that was registered 2 weeks prior in a same building as a small clothing store, a bar and a tourism office, placed a bid in the auction for YUKOS assets and won, unopposed. It was later purchased by Rosneft, but YUKOS assets auctioned off really could have gone anywhere (where Putin would allow them to go, of course).\n\nTo sum up - I think that sale of 19% Rosneft stake before the elections looks like a hedging gamble - either way elections would go, the shares would end up in the place Putin wants them to end up (either DJT or own personal benefit). Delaying the deal to after the elections would allow linkage between DJT (if he won) and the shares, so the deal went through in the last days before the election.\n\nSorry for the wall of text everyone, I probably could be more concise, but fuck it, I don't feel like editing :)",

But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.",

    "body": "Their argument is that the list Trump used was not created by him, therefore it's not his fault.\n\nBut they're either too dumb to understand, or are intentionally trying to not understand, that Trump has the authority to change the countries on the list by telling the Secretary of Homeland Security to do it. It's an executive branch power reserved by the President and Obama is not the President anymore, Trump is.\n\nThey also don't appear to want to understand that even if Trump's hands were tied by that list ***he didn't have to fucking target Green Card holders (U.S. permanent residents).***\n\nThey don't even read the damn sources they cite.\n\nThey cite DHS news releases but they contain no reference to people who have Green Cards and the screening is meant to be directed to people from those countries who did not have Green Cards and had to apply for visas to stay in the U.S. Obama never used the DHS screenings or the list in this way.\n\nFurthermore Trump should have known what his executive order would do and what the consequences of it would be.\n\nIt would be like if Obama used a drone strike to kill terrorists and then blamed Bush for collateral damage because \"he wasn't aware that could happen\". The buck stops with the President.",
