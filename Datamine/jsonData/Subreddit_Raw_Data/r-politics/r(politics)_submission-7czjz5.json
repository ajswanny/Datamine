They bought the island and deeded everyone one square foot. My deed even has the coordinates for where my square foot is located (beachfront, bitches!). We even got a little flag to plant on it when we visit.\n\nEdit: For those pointing out with Hawaii 2 that it's actually a lease, yes, this is true; however those who are leasing property which is taken under eminent domain can be entitled to compensation. Therefore if 150,000 of us are leased this new piece of land, the federal government still has to deal with that fact at some point. \nhttp://scholarship.law.marquette.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2596&context=mulr\n\n>As mentioned above, the fifth amendment to the federal constitution and the constitutions of the various states require \"just compensation\" wherever the interest of a person is taken under the power of eminent domain. Among the many interests which must be compensated for when taken is that of the tenant under a lease. This includes subtenants 7 and assignees of the lease.' \n\n[Here's a more recent one](https://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/administrative/real_property_trust_estate/committee/rp2590000/2015_10_19_leases_condemnation_paper.authcheckdam.pdf)\n\n\n\nI'm pretty sure CAH has a plan and good lawyers.\n\nEdit 2: OKAY guys yes, I get it, it's not a legally binding deed. My point is that CAH has already had experience with buying property on behalf of a group, they have lawyers, they didn't get into this fight if they thought they were going to just lose tomorrow instead of after the psycho mango is out of office. Let's wait and see what they have up their sleeve, but I for one think they probably have a shot or they wouldn't be trying it.

    "body": "There is a Native American tribe here in Arizona with tribal lands that extend into Sonora, Mexico, the Tohono O'odham. Tribal members that are US Citizens (and unfortunately, not all of them are) are apparently able to cross the border whenever they like, which is marked by a short fence. The PBS Newshour did a great segment on this a while back, but I can't find it.\n\nDuring the segment one of the tribal members literally crosses to the Mexico side of the border on camera and asserts that as a member of the tribe, he retains the right do so, even though the cameraman and reporter do not. The Tohono O'odham have a strong claim to the land that predates the United States AND Mexican governments, and they have asserted that they will not allow border wall construction on their lands, ever. Furthermore, their holy sites are located on the Mexico side of the border. It's not difficult to see them win in court against the administration if they defend their territorial claims on religious grounds, and ironically, they may have a much stronger case due to AG Sessions' actions to \"defend\" religious freedom. Here's a quote taken from [this Politico article](https://www.politico.com/story/2017/10/06/sessions-calls-for-broad-religious-freedom-protections-243536):\n\n> *\"Religious liberty is not merely a right to personal religious beliefs or even to worship in a sacred place,\" Sessions wrote. \"Except in the narrowest of circumstances, no one should be forced to choose between living out his or her faith and complying with the law. Therefore, to the greatest extent practicable and permitted by law, religious observance should be reasonably accommodated in all government activity, including employment, contracting and programming.\"*\n\nBasically, Sessions has inadvertently given the Tohono O'odham the best possible grounds to block construction of the wall on tribal lands, *especially if that wall cuts off holy sites*.\n\nPopcorn tastes good.",

So we\u2019ve purchased a plot of vacant land on the border and retained a law firm specializing in eminent domain to make it as time-consuming and expensive as possible for the wall to get built.\n> \n> On Day 1, all Cards Against Humanity Saves America recipients will get an illustrated map of the land, a certificate of our promise to fight the wall, some new cards, and a few other surprises.\n> \n> ---\n> \n> #FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS\n> \n> #####WHAT IS THIS?  \n> This is our holiday promotion, Cards Against Humanity Saves America.

With eminent domain and 5th amendment takings issues, the big sticking point is always \u201cwhat is your land worth,\u201d which is often answered by \u201cwhat did you want to do with it when you bought it?\u201d As compared to \u201cwhat are you able to do with it now, after we have taken ti or limited its use in some way?\u201d\n\nThe answer to the first question would be \u201cliterally nothing, it was an inch wide.\u201d So whats the value? Next to nothing. What is the reason they shouldnt take it? Literally nothing, because it was so small there is no way you could have ever done anything with it anyway.\n\nIf anything, splitting it up this way might make the government\u2019s case for eminent domain much easier.\n\nGovt: \u201cwe need it for national security\u201d (which, fyi, is like their biggest trump card in these things - its the best reason they can ever offer for anything)\nCitizen: \u201cbut you cant! That doesnt outweigh my need to use it for..... well.... literally nothing, because i cannot do anything with this tiny sliver of property.\u201d\n\nEdit: making it a monumental paperwork thing might be the better route.  But im still not sure - i dont know that they have to actually win any sort of eminent domain thing prior to seizing land. They may well be able to go seize it and start building and the landowners take it to court afterward. Its not like there\u2019s a home or business on this land that is being used and will suffer harm if some judge doesnt issue an injunction or restraining order.
