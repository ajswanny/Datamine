    "body": ">Cybersecurity experts say Pence\u2019s emails were likely just as insecure as Clinton\u2019s. While there has been speculation about whether Clinton's emails were hacked, Pence\u2019s account was actually compromised last summer by a scammer who sent an email to his contacts claiming Pence and his wife were stranded in the Philippines and in urgent need of money.\n\nLOL\n\nTo summarize:\n\n1. Pence used a private email account to conduct government business, just like Clinton.\n\n2. The emails contained discussions about \"sensitive matters and homelands security issues.\"\n\n3. Pence' private emails were hidden from public records requests, just like Clinton.\n\n4. Pence's private email was hacked, eliminating the \"but her homebrew server\" distinction without a difference. The account was compromised in June, yet Pence never disclosed the breach or the fact that he had a private account that he used for state business. \n\n5. Pence routinely criticized Clinton's private sever throughout the campaign, including saying that \"Clinton operated in such a way to keep her emails [ ] out of the public reach, public accountability.\"\n\n6. Fucking hypocrites. \n\n",

    "body": ">Pence\u2019s own account was compromised in June when a hacker sent a counterfeit email to his contacts claiming Pence he and his wife had been attacked on their way back to their hotel in the Philippines, losing their money, bank cards and mobile phone.\n\n>In response, Pence sent an email to those who had received the fake communication apologizing for any inconvenience. He also set up a new AOL account.\n\n>Because the hacker appears to have gained access to Pence\u2019s contacts, experts say it is likely that the account was actually penetrated, giving the hacker access to Pence\u2019s inbox and sent messages.\n\n>The nature of that hack suggests it was part of a broad, impersonal attack \u2014 not one carefully crafted to target Pence in particular, Cappos said.\n\nThis is a big deal ethically speaking. He's also a massive hypocrite.\n\nBut, I seriously doubt this was any kind of espionage campaign. If the goal was to exfil data from Pence's inbox, they wouldn't have sent emails from his account, which raises GIANT red flags. \n\nIMO, this was likely automated and the attacker(s) probably had no idea they had gotten into Pence's account. They probably snagged thousands of people with a phish and Pence was one. Those operations are usually massive in scale. \n\nIf you're waiting for some giant treasure trove of salacious Pence emails, don't hold your breath. ",

She was totally non-threatening, of course you found her more palatable.  But this Pence thing is a non-issue, politically.  It's not \"Hillary and Mike\" who use(d) private email **it's literally everyone.**  The fact that her email became such a huge deal was, I'm sure, completely shocking to her.  Since everyone knew she used private email, and everyone did the same thing.  It was just something people clung to when \"she just rubs me the wrong way\" was called out as sexism, and they needed some logical explanation for why they instinctively hated her.  \n  \nThe week after Trump was elected, it was so refreshing to hear certain contacts come out and say \"I guess we weren't ready for a female politician.\"  Meanwhile a few of my Berniecrat friends still don't get it & are salty over the new DNC chair.
