    "body": "Let's be honest: AMERICA PLAYED ITSELF BIG TIME on Tuesday, November 8th 2016. Let us not make this mistake again. \n\nWe got the choice wrong and we're all paying for it. This idiocy is remarkable. There are too many of these stories and the opinions, declarations and responses to them from around the world prove it. We narrowly elected (states where electoral mattered it was razor thin) a US President that obviously has no idea what he's doing, has not attempted to bring together this divided country and is ignorantly walking back much of the ideals that have made America so great. He's putting in place a cabinet and a list of advisors that will not move us forward but instead set us back 300 years of progress. (thanks, C. Rock)\n\nThe only way we are going to \"Make America Great\" is to keep America great by getting President Donald J. Trump out of office. Show him that this doesn't work for America. Remember, we are in the MAJORITY. Organize, donate to causes that matter, boycott where it will hurt, support companies that are supporting (eg LYFT, AirBnB), position companies to follow their competitors, band together, march and call your representatives. Also, support those that are already standing up in numerous ways (citizens, organizations, politicians, celebrities, companies, countries)\n\nAnd in 2018, VOTE.",

So much ignorance and naivete, I just closed my laptop and sat there stunned on how people could *possibly* think he's going about this the right way. His policy is garbage, but if he went about it correctly, I would just be mad about it. Now I'm extremely nervous about what will happen in the coming weeks and months. \n\n\n The only real consolation is that a lot of people are very fucking angry and motivated to organize.

They are convinced that globalism and multiculturalism are weakening, rather than strengthening, America, and the Obama administration was simply the culmination of that process.\n\nWhen you look at the backgrounds of these true-believers, you will find that almost without fail they inhabit insular communities and live lives that do not cross with those of other economic/ethnic groups. Yes, most are white. Not all of them are well-off. Many are feeling economic hardship but felt ignored under recent Democratic administrations (it used to be the worker's party; notice how that's slowly changed since Carter? Remember when West Virginia was blue as hell?) They know of the world through the television and the Facebook page rather than actually going out into it and connecting with it, so when they get hammered with OUR WAY OF LIFE IS UNDER ATTACK for eight years, Donald Trump is the sort of person they're going to run to.\n\nI'm one of the biggest Obama fans there is but I *can* say that he (and, subsequently, Hillary Clinton) didn't do nearly enough to reach out to the voting base who have now fallen behind The Donald. Dismiss these people as backwoods racist idiots at your own peril -- I have constantly said that their anger is wrongly directed at minorities but it is genuine all the same, concern for one's own economic and/or social status being reduced in favor of some other entity they barely know anything about. Concern for one's own future. Feeling pressured by a hyper-politically-correct media to adhere to new social rules springing up seemingly every day.\n\nI hope that liberals like me can remember, in the coming months, that the working class white voter who voted for Trump, and who may subsequently lose their health insurance or benefits, or who voted for him expecting the impossible revitalization of a dying industry, is going to need just as much support as the minorities and socially disadvantaged people the president is already attacking. Liberals should not shun them, because they're going to need them.\n\n**EDIT**: there were so many responses to this comment I'm going to need a separate email server, hue hue hue",

There have already been a few tension filled interviews, and, if the whitehouse leaks turn out to be true, Reince Priebus even considered resigning just so he didn't have to go on Fox News. Fox's bread and butter has been acting as staunch contrarians to the establishment. I think it's 50/50 whether they stick strictly to party lines, or oppose the establishment in general. Besides, just because Fox takes a stance against the decisions of the President, it doesn't mean that they have aligned with the left. It's much easier to always yell about how bad things are than to defend some course of action.\n\nThat said, there are still organizations like Breitbart which will support Trump regardless of his performance, and I'm sure that they will at least blame someone (Even though republicans control 2, and possibly soon 3, branches of government). The problem is a magnified version of what democrats faced in 2008-2010. The most energetic supporters will expect some type of change that affects them positively. But given the near absolute authority the party currently has, unless Trump gives his base at least one thing that they can point to as an improvement, then it will be tough for even the most irrational supporter to find anyone to blame other than their fearless leader, or the Republican leadership.

    "body": "It's a fair bit more complicated than that. Fox News was first envisaged in the mid-90s as a way to get on the cable news horse CNN pioneered. Fox's owner, Rupert Murdoch, a man with a long history of turning respectable newspapers into tabloid trash, tapped Roger Ailes for the job of producing this new channel's content, a right-wing propaganda organ packaged as news. For the next two decades, Fox News was incredibly successful at what it did.\n\nInterestingly enough, Trump was the causor of Fox News' burgeoning change in direction, but not in the obvious way. Murdoch and Ailes clashed over Fox's Trump coverage. See, Murdoch's long-term goal with News Corporation (Fox's overlord) has been to create a corporatist media organ. Trump is not a corporatist. He's a populist, and Ailes believed his populism would sell. *That* relationship began straining in the spring of 2016, as Ailes used Fox News to push for Trump's nomination (much to Murdoch's dismay), and when the sex-assault scandal broke, Ailes found himself kicked out of Fox News's offices and flat on his ass.\n\nHe promptly joined the Trump campaign and the last I heard the two had had a falling-out. I would be supremely unsurprised if it involved either (a) a personality clash, (b) Trump not paying Ailes, or (c) a combination thereof.\n\nThe upshot of this is that, as we enter this new administration, Fox News -- for the first time in its history -- has no clear strategic focus. And with a President who is deeply unpopular among both the left-of-center and the moderate right, Fox News has literally nothing to lose by joining the rest of the mainstream media in opposition to Trump right now.",
