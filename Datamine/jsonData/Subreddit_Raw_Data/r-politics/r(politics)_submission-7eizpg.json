Powell saw it as an undermining of Americans' faith in enterprise and another step in the slippery slope of socialism.

    "body": "> Regional \u201cmonopolies\u201d are going to happen, these are geographically isolated natural monopolies.\n\nDepends on how you set up service delivery. Let's look at power companies in Texas, for example. There are heavily regulated companies that are responsible for maintaining delivery of power, and less (market) regulated companies responsible for creating that power. The former compete for territory, and the latter compete for customers.\n\nIn theory, this isn't much different than how internet works. You can set up a heavily regulated sector that maintains the physical infrastructure and guarantees data access at the home/business, while other companies compete based on routing/speed/congestion \"solutions.\" Delivered speeds, for the most part, is not limited by the cabling (assuming fiber), but rather where that cabling is terminated (cable boxes, neighborhood terminals, home computer speed, end-nodes at data centers etc.).\n\nIn some ways, we see this model emerging in VPNs tailored to \"high-speed\" gaming, guaranteeing lower pings by strictly controlling the routes of traffic. If that were expanded to ISPs as a whole, it would actually allow ISPs to compete with each other and not trip over one another with redundant physical infrastructure. At worst, it would require additional hardware at some termination nodes increasing latency slightly, but one might imagine that competition in that area might lead to some amazing innovations.\n\nMonopolies like this don't have to exist, but everybody has basically thrown up their hands and given up because \"nobody understands this wizard technology.\"",

It is the current state of things (since 2015), and more importantly, it was the previous *de-facto* state of things, a fact that Ajit Pai really doesn't want to admit. He acts like this horrible regulation that hindered the growth of the Internet was enacted. In fact, it was only enacted once the ISPs got access to the hardware and power needed to shape access based on content. The first time it happened was when Comcast tried to squelch bittorrent traffic in 2007, and remained tied up in courts until 2010, when Comcast eventually won.  At which point, FCC issued changes called the FCC Open Internet Order 2010, which itself remained tied up in courts with Verizon until 2014, where Verizon eventually partially won. Which caused a new round of FCC discussions.\n\nAll of this is wholly regardless of whether or not the Internet is a luxury. The major issue it hand is in regards to equal entry opportunity into the market. So, if someone implements \"YouTube, but without the horrible comment system, and without the false-positive copyright strikes and without the false-postitive ad-demonitization, it might behave like a slug unless it can generate the capital needed to form a buddy-buddy deal with each individual ISP.",

I posted about it before but can't find it in my long history.  But basically he said to me that this part of the world (Europe) looks at the American GOP as one of the most dangerous groups on the planet. They are the real terrorists in the eyes of a ton of people over there.  They are viewed in the same light as an African dictatorship.  Not caring about their people, only helping themselves, using force and political tactics to achieve personal goals not goals for the people, etc.\n\nAnd then just look at the US now with full R control, we are a joke, we are one of the few who continuously supports fucking things up or not stopping fucked up things.  The GOP absolutely must go, and it's way more important for Americans at least the the GOP go first.  Before ISIS even.  The GOP is that dangerous to Americans (considering ISIS rarely actually attacks on American soil, the GOP essentially attacks daily).  We are talking about a group that care infinity more about guns and the freedom to blow someone head off for stepping on your lawn than healthcare or education.  Let that sink in.  They fight for guns, they never fight for education or healthcare.  The party of freedom sure likes to limit freedoms too.\n\nEDIT:  Insert generic public comment about receiving gold and a thank you here",

It even gives an outline of the issue and a script you can read if you wish. You just tap the person you want to call and read the script (or use you own words!). It takes less than 5 minutes. \n\nAnother thing, I think people, including myself actually, are a little intimidated about calling. But don't worry, most of the time you won't be speaking to an actual representative.

Because congress would stop anything bad he tries, right?), I started looking into other parts of his platform. When I was voting, I just fell for all these really terrible arguments and just didn't know how things work. But then when he started banning Muslims...It just felt so unamerican to me. This is when I started finally applying concepts I've learned in college into the real world. I researched. I read up on how things work. Once I looked at facts instead of opinions, I started to form my own opinions.\n\nI'm only 19 now, and was only 18 when I voted.
