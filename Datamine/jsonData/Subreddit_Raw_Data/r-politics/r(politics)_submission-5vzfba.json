None of those things are integral to fascism. Fascism is a far-right, authoritarian political ideology, whose core tenets are militarism, corporatism, extreme nationalism, anti-intellectualism, delegitimizing the press, and scapegoating minorities. Remember, *all* of these things are necessary to be fascist. One point does not make an ideology. Just because other political parties may harbor several of these characteristics does not make them fascist.\n\nTo anyone who is familiar with political philosophy, the Trump Administration is increasingly looking like a textbook example of fascism. If we're going to just ignore the lessons of the 1930s and 1940s, then we should be debating the value of liberal democracy versus fascism, and not whether or not this Administration is fascist (because it's no longer up for debate).\n\nEdit: To everyone trying to claim fascism is actually left-wing, not only are you wrong, but it is as ridiculous as saying that communism is actually right-wing. You aren't going to successfully gaslight anyone who understands the basic political spectrum.",

I hope you have a great weekend! Overall, opinions will vary on which media outlets are bias and which ones are not. There can be a general consensus as to which media outlets are bias and which media outlets are not bias, but IMHO, no media outlet is perfect. \nFor a president to ban specific groups of media outlets just because he/she does not like/agree with them is not ok no matter what (especially those that have partaken in WH press briefing activities for several, several years under different presidents). \n",

The original mission was to keep Wilson from ending his press conferences. In the 100 years since that founding in February of 1914, the group has expanded its mission to pushing for broader access to the White House and supporting vigorous reporting on the presidency.",

Four years of this and you might be able to turn it into a functioning propaganda network.

WSJ or Fox will then get a special interview with an \"unnamed Whitehouse official,\" debunking that story. Then Trump will retweet it. They will get page views!\n\nThat is what they just tried to do with the FBI this week. Priebus requested the FBI's McCabe have someone go \"on background,\" i.e., off the record, and shoot down the NYT story.

If Trump will give an interview to Bill O'Rielly and no one else? You have to watch Fox. Some reports don't require Spicer or Whitehouse cooperation, but the Whitehouse can restrict access and it will hurt the stations financially. Sure, CNN with their Turner money might weather the storm? But the message is clear. And there are plenty of smaller entities that don't have that luxury. Breitbart and Mother Jones were comparable in size not long ago, but thanks to Trump's nurturing, Breitbart is much bigger now.",

Trump *loves* Putin and lies on his bed, twirling his pigtails and dreaming of being Putin.\n\nBut he has two big problems:\n\n1) He's not anywhere near as smart as Putin is (and BTW, neither is Bannon).\n\n2) Before Putin came along, Russia didn't have a long and well-established history of press freedom. Just the opposite, in fact; they were only a decade or so out from under the Soviet government. Their free press was really just getting off the ground. That made them a lot easier to control and intimidate. American media is a very different beast; they do *not* like being told what to do by the government. This can be seen by the fact that even traditional Conservative mouthpiece outlets like Fox News are pissed off at Trump for the shit that he's pulled. Because they know very well that they could be next.\n\nSo yeah, this is all straight out of the Putin playbook. But it's being implemented in such an incompetent way that not only will it not work, it will actually have the opposite of the intended effect.",
