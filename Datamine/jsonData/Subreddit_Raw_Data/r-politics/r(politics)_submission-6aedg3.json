But remember - he told Congress, not the U.S. Public. Now, perhaps he knew it would leak, but I don't think he informed them hoping it would leak. I think we need to place more blame on Chaffetz than Comey for that. Plus, don't forget, he wanted to inform all of Congress and the Public about the Trump/Russia Investigation as early as July of 2016 but he was forbidden to. \n\nI think it's possible to criticize some of the actions he's taken throughout his career, while still realizing all that he's done and that he's a highly respected government official. And no matter what you think of him, he shouldn't have been fired in the manner he was. Trump clearly did it this way because he's a coward, and was intimidated by Comey's stature, title, and knowledge of the Investigation; he was probably afraid of what he'd tell him.\n\nI think anyone who is happy he got fired, doesn't understand the implications of what could possibly happen now. They're missing the bigger picture. Trump is going to try to place a puppet in the job and consolidate power and make this investigation go away. Whatever your thoughts on Comey, he was the Devil we Know - not to mention, he was leading the fastest moving/furthest along investigation into Trump/Russia ties.\n\nSo I REALLY hope Comey - via testimony or leaks - is the one that ends up bringing down Donald Trump and his entire, corrupt administration.",

Are you saying the investigation is contained to NY to ensure it is a state offense rather than a federal and that pardoning is not possible? \n\nState and federal prosecutors oversee different jurisdictions, and the President's pardon power does not affect state law or prosecution. The previous poster is suggesting - correctly - that because a *state* grand jury is investigating Mr. Trump and/or his associates and/or the Trump Organization, any indictments that come out of that grand jury are immune from Mr. Trump's pardon power.\n\n>Or would this case have gone to NY naturally anyway?\n\nOnly those crimes committed in New York can be investigated by state law enforcement.\n\n> Also side note, what does the court in Virginia have to do with anything? Why Virginia?\n\nThis is the fun part: The federal district court in the Eastern District of Virginia is called the Rocket Docket, because it moves *fast* in issuing indictments, subpoenas, and such.  I'm not sure what the mechanism is that allows that other than the fact that judges there like to go fast, but realistically what it means is that the federal government, which convened the EDVA grand jury, did it there rather than Washington D.C. (which is its own district) because it wanted to go fast.  Since the 1970s the EDVA has been the fastest or second-fastest district in the country.  But remember: this is the *federal* district and it's had two grand juries convened, at least.\n\n",

    "body": "The best progress I've made is to ask, \"what would convince you that X is true?\"  And try to get them to lay down some goalposts.  \n\nThey'll deny, for instance, that there's any active investigation into Trump's campaign connections to Russia.  \"He was cleared of all wrongdoing despite the Democrats' sore loser witch hunt.\"  Ill say, \"would the director of the FBI director claiming under oath that there's an still an active investigation be enough?\"  If I can get an answer, I'll pull up an video clip of that exact thing.  It has to be stamped with a Fox News logo to not be immediately dismissed as fake.  Then they'll move the goalposts, claim it was out of context (even after I pull up the full 2 hour session) and find some Alex Jones conspiracy video to dispute the claim.\n\nOfficial press releases from the Whitehouse are another source I like to use, but even if AP distributes it, it's fake.\n\nUsing Socratic methods takes a lot of time and patience.  Usually they'll suspect some kind of trap and won't play along, get angry, argue over minutia or just make false equivalencies like, \"but Hillary had people killed to cover up her lies.  What about that?\"  Then storm away in a rage.  Simply agreeing on facts and reality is the biggest hurdle and seems impossible to clear.  Even if we get to that point, it seems to be completely forgotten within a day and has to be rehashed from scratch if the point is ever to be made again.  I honestly can't understand how someone can operate on a day-to-day basis with such a lack of rational thought and distortion of reality.  I think that lack of understanding is really what drives me to continue pushing.",
