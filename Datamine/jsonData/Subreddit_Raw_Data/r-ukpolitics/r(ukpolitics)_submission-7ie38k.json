The lack of borders in Ireland effectively commits us to a soft Brexit without explicitly saying so, but there's no way Theresa May will admit this.\n\nUntil now, the EU has adopted a relatively hard stance, wanting to make sure some of the tough questions, like the Irish border, were properly answered before proceeding to stage 2. But this agreement doesn't really do that. \n\nSo what's the point of it? The answer - it's charity. The EU negotiators seriously feared that Theresa May's government was in imminent danger of collapsing and being replaced by something worse. So the \"agreement\" is effectively the EU throwing May a bone saying \"we'll let you slide on some of the details for now, because we'd prefer to negotiate with you than plunge the UK into chaos, so we'll give you a short term win without changing our long term goals by one iota\".\n\nThere's still a lot of ground to cover, and it's quite uncertain how the hard brexiters in her party (and those in her cabinet) will react as it becomes clear that we are going soft.",

We would have paid for these things and much more had we remained, and few would complain because of course it still would have been the better choice economically.\n\nVery few of us want Brexit here on Reddit, but I have to say, ignorance about our relationship with the EU, such as is shown by your outrage over a false pretense is exactly the kind of thing that got us here in the first place.\n\nA better thing to focus on in this topic is whether or not we'll see the benefits of the financial investments we're funding in the settlement. Will they be in the form of favours to politicians? Will they return to the pockets of the British citizens who paid for them one way or another? Will we even see those benefits at all?\n\nThat being said, we were the 5th richest country before joining the EU in 1972. In 2016 we were still in 5th place. Now this is obviously too simple a method of judging a country's economic success by, but I think it should play a part in soothing anxiety for some of us.\n\nWe're a highly developed English speaking nation with a strong military, fairly impartial media and low corruption. We were doing well before joining the EU, and despite continuing to do well in the EU, we'll still do well when we leave.\n\nWe've got a lot things to improve, so let's focus a bit more on housing, infrastructure and productivity.",

The only two upsides are (1) a sudden Renaissance of EU awareness as Europeans learn about all the things the EU does and what they'd be missing out on and (2) that finally finally the EU can get more social and establish its social pillar (if Denmark can be convinced to say yes). What's that? It's social protections, eg to avoid that local contracts are replaced wth long term non-local contracts. And minimum social insurance. And... Look at the list:\n\nhttps://ec.europa.eu/commission/priorities/deeper-and-fairer-economic-and-monetary-union/european-pillar-social-rights/european-pillar-social-rights-20-principles_en\n\nIt's basically all the things the average citizen would complain the EU is not doing - and it wasn't doing it as the UK (&DK) government was vetoing them.\n\nSo the UK leaving might enable the EU to fix many of the concerns that fuelled Brexit in the first place.\n\nBut otherwise - its a loss. Both sides lose international standing, soft and trade power, etc. But EU27 is much less damaged than the UK. UK will have to accept pretty much one of the two/three trade standards, set respectively by EU, US (and China to some degree). May's government threatened to make the UK a tax haven to have a business after Brexit (and threaten the other countries). Think about what a downfall that is.\n\nReally, no one in the rest EU wants Brexit. Some uninformed/misinformed but loud majority achieved a slim referendum win in the UK and since then the gov has put on blinds and embarrassed the UK more than any other government in 1-200 years. My hope is there'll be another referendum when terms are set, and the majority speaks out against it.",

It has also increased unemployment and reduced wages to poverty levels. Plenty of graduates who are now \u00a327,000 in debt aren't even qualified to flip burgers when they finally join the labour market at 21/22 years of age. \n\nWe have taken on a lot of graduates in recent years at our works and out of all of them, only 3 of them were any use. Two of them are now managers (fair play) only a few years after starting. We had two of our undergrads fighting in the canteen last year like a bunch of 10 year olds. We have taken on apprentices instead this year. One of them was useless and got sacked for being on his phone all the time but the others seem to be working out pretty well. \n\nUniversity should be a privilege for those youngsters who have demonstrated exceptional academic ability by passing the 11+, going to grammar school and achieving high grades and should be able to get a grant to do so. Just like my uncle and my father before me. Not something we give to anyone who can scribble their name with a crayon and saddle them with crippling debt for the rest of their lives. ",

That means that the UK must retain trade regulation equivalence with the EU.\n\nThis is critical because a primary economic basis for Brexit, amongst those businesses and business people that supported it, was that the regulatory environment of the EU was overburdening UK companies. And that the UK could increase its competitiveness by leaving, thus freeing these businesses from the requirements of complying with labyrinthine EU regulations. They could instead comply with a new, simpler UK regime, then sell into foreign markets via laissez-faire free-trade agreements.\n\nHowever, the EU (with a little help from the DUP) has essentially used the Irish border issue to make this dream impossible, even before the trade negotiations have started. Yes, it's in nobody's interest to lock the UK out of trade, but nor is it is the EU's interest to let the UK get a free trade deal that lets it simultaneously escape the regulatory burden, and still sell into the single market. Doing so would make leaving the EU too attractive a prospect to many other member states.\n\nAs things now stand, the EU can insist that for every area in which we want to trade with them, we have to apply equivalent regulatory standards to everything we produce, sign-up to standards bodies, accept the judgement of supranational institutions like the ECJ, etc. And the UK has no fallback, because the default position, enshrined in this agreement, is that it will not allow regulations to diverge in any area. And the EU is not going to let the UK diverge in any way that puts member-state interests at a disadvantage.\n\nIn the long run, the regulatory burden on UK businesses is likely to *increase* because of Brexit, not decrease. Businesses wanting to sell into Europe will have to comply with UK regulations *and* EU regulations. The former will be a 99.9% copy-and-paste of the latter, but with occasional deviations that will become pitfalls for unwary companies, and require hiring legal specialists familiar with both UK and EU law in order to ensure compliance.",

IMO this means that despite significant efforts to play smoke and mirrors to call it something else, London has de facto decided (quite wisely) for Soft Brexit and kicked the can of worms of going any further than that to a future majority  government unburdened by NIreland.",

    "body": "Actually I could envision a more common sense approach, it will never happen of course.\n\nFreedom of movement within the EU originally was between countries  that were relatively well economically balanced between each other. \n\nAs the EU expanded, countries were accepted with a lower economic balance. Meaning the larger markets France, UK, Germany etc act like a magnet to draw in people from the less economically strong nations. \n\nNow do not get me wrong, I don't have a big issue with the jobs thing. I think most migrants are either taking on unskilled work that most British will not. Or migrants are skilled workers and filling valuable and needed positions within the economy and society. \n\nI think there is a small, but not insignificant factor, that there is some cross over with unskilled labour wage depression. Migrants willing to work for minimum pay, and British workers rejecting because it should be higher. Obviously without the migrants those businesses would have to pay more to the British workers or have no staff. So there is some areas where there is wage depression. But that does not mean that migration has been bad, on the whole I think it has been good more industries and people than it has harmed.\n\nHowever I imagine the big concern with unrestricted free movement, is on areas like rate of change of culture and the ability for our infrastructure to absorb and cope with the rapid increase of persons in the UK.\n\nFor example - housing - we already were not building enough to keep up with growth. Having 300,000+ net migration yearly just makes that even more daunting. Makes house price growth even more ridiculous. \n\nEducation and Healthcare. Yes migrants pay tax, and help support these services no question there. But it takes a good long while to build new schools and hospitals. It takes even longer in the medical field to staff them properly. \n\nThen there is an element of protectionism of culture. I prefer to think that most people are not out right racists, though some are terrible. A lot of people in certain areas have seen such sudden growth of foreign culture and peoples within their local area. They feel put out, concerned about the loss of their areas identity. It is a bit ridiculous, but I can understand some of the emotion around it. Most people prefer to see a subtle and gradual change, in some areas, it has been massive change in just a few years.\n\nWhat I think was being asked by Britain on the immigration front - end to all free movement - is ridiculous and never going to be agreed. \n\nHowever asking for a balance to state net migration into the UK from the EU must not exceed 100,000 or another number that is manageable might not have been a bad idea. (It could be, just saying might not be). \n\nObviously special cases, such as bringing Wife or Child to live with Father for example - would have to be exempt anyway under article 8 - so net migration might end up higher than the agreed number - but not massively over the limit. \n\nif you have a known influx number, evening it out over time helps to make it more manageable, you can plan for the long term, you can build the infrastructure. Culture changes a little slower, creating less resistance. There is no 'unlimited supply of cheap labour' which lessens the effects of wage depression in certain areas. \n\nI can see why a country would want this. I can also see why the EU  would oppose it.

    "body": "It's Ireland, not Eire- because you'e speaking English right now. And if you were referring to the state in the Irish language it would be \u00c9ire not Eire. Post independence Britain refused to refer to the new state as Ireland for many years for political reasons (Ireland maintained a territorial claim over the whole island).\n\nThere was also some initial diversity in how the state was referred to in Ireland, with \u00c9ire and Ireland being used interchangeably, including the omission of the fada in some contexts which is an unfortunate misspelling. You see while \u00c9ire means Ireland, Eire means a [load or burden!](http://www.teanglann.ie/en/fgb/eire) Which is perhaps inappropriate given Irelands impact on the UKs ability to get the Brexit settlement they might want! \n\nThis isn't about being pedantic, its just that a lot of British people learned to refer to 'Eire' in school while over time its become accepted that the correct terminology is to refer to Ireland in English and \u00c9ire in Irish. So my aim is purely to inform.\n\nThe more you know!",

Anything you do attempt to do may well just engender animosity and polarisation, thus making the problem worse. But even if there is something you can do about it, what liberals actually have done about it definitely has made things worse, mainly because they refuse to accept the ineluctable premise that not everyone shares their values and there's fuck all they can do about that.\n\nYou're right that rich people use fear and hate, but they can only do so because they possess certain concrete tools.\n\nThey use institutions, and institutions use them. The state is one such institution (among many). Most states (including EU states) have immigration controls of some kind. Trump wanted a big nasty evil Wall; Clinton wanted a nice cuddly fence... \n\nThe state defines the category of \"immigrant\". All states promote nationalism. Most liberals are nationalists and most nationalists are liberals. UKIP can always play up their \"moderate\" credentials because really they're not saying anything particularly immoderate!\n\nPutin *is* a demon, yet, all the same, demonising Russia is part of a wearyingly familiar narrative of cultural exceptionalism designed to legitimise and empower a particular institution, a particular set of \"rich people\". Putin is trying to undermine the EU because the EU is trying to undermine him with its trade sanctions! Yet, as is the wont of the powerful, both sides will play the victim, pointing the finger at the wicked alien. \n\nAll the various \"rich people\" factions in this are playing the same stupid, old fashioned game.
