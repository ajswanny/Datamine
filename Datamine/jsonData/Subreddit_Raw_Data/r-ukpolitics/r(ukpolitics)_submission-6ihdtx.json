These **same people** were citing a \"Norway model\" of working with the EU while staying out of it. THEY'RE PART OF SCHENGEN!\n\nDavid Cameron got us a cracking deal with the EU. More sovereignty. Ensuring sure people from the EU couldn't get benefits here unless they'd worked here for at 4 years. (You can [read more](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-35622105) if you want.)\n\nAll of this should have been made clearer and pushed by the remainers. The fact that voting leave =/= less immigration. But they couldn't - because they (like me) all think immigration is brilliant. So why would they want to hinder it? And it would be dangerous for MPs in diverse constituencies if they campaigned to remain on an anti-immigration stance. They could lose their seats next election.\n\nI personally tried, I pretended I was against immigration like some of my leave voting friends and explained the special deal we'd been given and how it wasn't guaranteed at all that we'd get less immigration if we left. I told them what the Norway model actually was. I explained why the bus was bullshit. I persuaded about half of them. So I know it would have worked if the remain campaign had done it.

Nickell and Salaheen (2015) find that a 10\npercentage point (not 10%, as misleadingly claimed by a number of politicians) rise\nin the immigrant share \u2013 that is, larger than that observed over the entirety of the last\ndecade \u2013 leads to approximately a 1.5% reduction in wages for native workers in the\nsemi/unskilled service sector. **This would mean that immigration since 2004 would\nhave reduced wages for native workers in that sector by about 1%, or put another\nway would have depressed annual pay increases by about a penny an hour.\nImpacts in other sectors are even smaller. The conclusion is that while migration\nmay have had some small negative impact on wages for the low paid, other factors,\npositive and negative (technological change, policies on tax credits, the National\nMinimum Wage) were far more important.**\n\n[Source](http://data.parliament.uk/writtenevidence/committeeevidence.svc/evidencedocument/home-affairs-committee/immigration/written/45077.pdf)\n\n[For reference, this is the impact of the tax and benefit policy changes **just over this parliament**.](https://i.gyazo.com/1404bcbe6b431aafee3f6bbaaf489982.png) As the evidence above notes, the changes due to immigration, if they do indeed exist, are absolutely minuscule compared to the impact of past and future government policy. \n\nThe idea that immigrants have any kind of significant impact on the earnings of anyone is absolutely laughable. As is the idea that the Tories *actually* care about the prospects of the low paid. Btw, if you look at the previous OBR forecasts for post-Brexit, lower immigration is already scheduled to cost us billions in tax revenue. This is money that could go towards reversing the benefit cuts that will go so far to hurt those on low incomes. \n\nWhat we should be doing as a society, is being as open and liberal as possible. This would make us as prosperous as possible. But this growth is not evenly spread, which is what redistribution is for. The issue we have of course is Labour understands the redistribution point (or used to), but not the liberal point, while the Tories understand liberal economics is the way forward (or used to at least) but not redistribution.\n\ne: [here is the relative change linked above as opposed to absolute values.](https://i.gyazo.com/bfbac6065e28bd36705692664a1307d6.png)",

Anyone who looks into the EU for more than five minutes, or has followed its history at all, knows that the EU always puts its political objectives above the written words of treaties and law.\n\nThe EU is strongly in favour of allowing anyone to move anywhere inside the EU because it wants the EU to be a new country that replaces the existing countries. Juncker himself - the man who makes EU law - said he thinks borders are the worst invention by politicians ever.\n\nRegardless of what EU law *says*, what matters is what the EU *does*. There is a post further up this thread that shows EU courts interpreting these laws in surprising ways - people who don't earn any money still being considered employed, and so on.\n\nMoreover, the reason the UK can't easily implement these sorts of policies is because - being an island - it relies on borders a lot more heavily than European countries do. Other countries tend to rely on systems of internal registration enforced by landlords rather than border checks, along with mandatory ID cards, so they can more track and deport people. The UK *could* have implemented a European style system, at great cost and difficulty (it requires a cultural transition really), but why should it? I can't honestly say that strong borders and relatively relaxed internal government tracking is a bad thing.",

They refused to put on transitional controls, whether this would have been enough to temper the anti-immigration backlash is anyone's guess. Nevertheless, the fact that they did not even try prevents the Labour party today to have ago at the Tory party. I say this as a passionate Remainer, Labour party voter and member. But it would reek of hypocrisy in the eyes of economic left-wing people who often switch their vote between Labour, Tories and UKIP. Not a good vote winning strategy.\n\nThe Liberal Democrat and Green party are so pro-EU they don't really care the law and powers over Freedom of movement was not used by the UK government, both Labour and Tories. They wouldn't have had transitional controls let alone tighten the regulations of non-UK EU citizens moving into the UK. If they tried to lecture the Labour and Tories about using the powers to further control the movement of people from the EU they would be laughed at. Because they honestly are happy with what happened overall. They reason their MPs do not say this so directly is because they'd lose votes, especially the Lib Dems who need all the votes they can get from swing voters.\n\n*For the record I think freedom of movement is a good thing overall for the economy and society, I just would have had temporary transitional controls and invested more money (in housing, schools, local GPs, increased the minimum wage to a proper living wage) to dampen the socio-economic impact felt by people on a local level. Labour and then the Tories just handled this situation terribly.

We also see massive pressure on housing and infrastructure here in London too so I'm not sure the distribution is that skewed, we see ten to a house here too and roads and trains are at capacity despite the billions invested. What I wonder is how come there's a housing crisis. In theory free markets should lead to more housing being built to redress the balance (from immigration and population growth) but you've got to ask why we don't see this in practice.\n\nPersonally I don't think it's a coincidence that a generation or two after we stopped building council houses we've ended up with a housing crisis. I'm pretty upset that the government now has to provide social housing for those who need it by renting on the private market instead of maintaining it's own housing stock - inflating rents for everyone in the process.\n\n",

They didn't have the same costs a resident would have. For them the reduced pay was fantastic compared to what they got at home.\n\nThat is the problem.

    "body": "Immigrants under cutting wages isn't actually as much a thing as you may think. It makes straightforward economic sense but as with everything else in economics, reality is much more complex and nuanced. \n\nMinimum wage, for example, is set by the government. No number of immigrants will change this. Costa is going to pay you at or just above minimum wage to make coffee regardless of how many immigrants there are. \n\nBut take higher paying jobs, like software developers. Everyone knows that there has been an influx of EU devs coming in to work in London where the money is. You'd expect software developer wages to go down. \n\nBut they haven't. They've risen faster than the average. That's because the widely available high quality talent, plus maybe a dozen other factors that make London a good place to be a tech innovator, have led to lots of growth in the sector. Companies are thriving DESPITE expensive labour, not because of it. \n\nAnd this is a microcosm of the economy. It sounds like immigration would lead to downward wage pressure, but most evidence we have suggests the opposite, according to a number of recent studies especially this one from OECD: https://www.oecd.org/migration/OECD%20Migration%20Policy%20Debates%20Numero%202.pdf . \n\nThey fill niches locals don't want to. They pay more in taxes than they take in benefits (yes, that's true), and they spend what they make within the economy, creating jobs and markets for businesses. \n\nBut hating on immigrants is a good way to keep people occupied. Take Hungary. They're currently running a bit anti immigration campaign ( except nobody wants to immigrate to hungary) on the basis that immigrants are taking the jobs (they aren't). \n\nBut at the same time they run loads of government initiatives to promote people having kids. If they were so worried about more people being a drain on the economy, why would they do that?\n\nBecause it's an easy way to distract people from the fact that your small scale economic and lifestyle problems are not the fault of immigrants, but of poor or unfair policy actions that are distributing wealth towards the richest and making the life of the poorest harder. \n\nAll of the economic problems blamed on immigrants could be solved with domestic policy changes. But they won't do that because then who would brexiteers hate?",

The cause of integration has been clearly prioritised ahead of the welfare of EU citizens (see the euro project), and ahead of the concept of democracy (see the lisbon treaty).\n\nThe question then becomes, are you content with the UK being permanently governed by such a body? The longer the UK remains in the EU, the more painful any separation would become. That is very much a part of the design. The fundamental design principle of the EU is that of a ratchet. Power is centralised by small degrees, but any movement in the other direction requires a destruction of the relationship. This also kills one of the fundamental parts of a democracy. Don't like the current government's health policy? Replace them. Don't like the current government's decision to sign the Lisbon treaty? Tough shit, they did, and now you're stuck with it unless you ditch out of the whole project. It moves a huge amount of power to irreversible executive decisions rather than reversible legislation.\n\nI voted leave because, realistically, it was leave now or be dragged to federalism by degrees, and I don't believe that the EU is capable of providing good representative government on that scale.

I oppose the EU on two main grounds - its unrepresentative structure and its economic policies. Someone pointed out below that we're stuck with a tory government anyway but I see that as a separate problem. If we ever did have more progressive government they would be severely constrained by EU membership, so I see leaving as us having one less problem. We have more opportunities to change the way things are done in Westminster than in Brussels. \n\nI'm not questioning your sincerity but quite a few people have said \"I've never a genuine reason for voting leave\" to me, when what they mean is they haven't heard one that they agree with.

I would say that it's our \"pragmatic\", transactional approach to the EU that has caused the problems. The EU is certainly a trade club that benefits us in cash terms, but it's so much more than that.\n\nIt's explicitly designed as a bulwark against fascism. It brings us together; binds us into a common, shared community. The *purpose* is to undermine harmful nationalisms that have led to so many devastating wars.\n\nIt's no surprise that hate-filled nationalists want to do everything they can to undermine it. Their entire world-view is founded upon the lie that someone from Gdansk or Lille (or increasingly, London!) is profoundly different from someone from Sheffield or Doncaster.\n\n> They didn't experience that boom.\n\nReal incomes across the developed world have remained static, as the global poor have been slowly catching up with us. Overall that's a *good thing* - we shouldn't want to live in a world where we live in comparative luxury while 90% of our fellows endure grinding poverty.\n\n> Europeans do share a lot of culture. But vanishingly small is over the top.\n\nMy point is that cultural differences *within* the UK are greater than between EU countries. There is a cultural gulf between a plumber in Wolverhampton and a Welsh farmer, or a fox hunting aficionado from Surrey, or an academic from Cambridge.\n\n> I think people have a natural ingroup preference.

Individual countries might sport some degree of social democratic policies, but socialism is not a single country thing.\n\nThen, moving down the scales, the EU. You mention that the EU's unrepresentative structure. Now we could go on some debate on that, but just like any organisation, the way it works could be changed. The reason it isn't because countries, such the UK, was holding onto its ideal of fully sovereign nation state club. With that in mind you can see how the EU structure became the way it is.\n\nStill, there is representation. The problem with that representation is that,  especially in the UK the MEP election was used to push local political agendas instead of actually representing UK interest within the Union.\n\n> We have more opportunities to change the way things are done in Westminster than in Brussels.\n\nDo you? To me it looks like that the UK is one of the most undemocratic countries in the EU in terms of representation. It looks like that we have pretty much the same government for decades with very little change along the way. Not to mention that the with the FPTP system produces truly perverse election results, especially on local level.\n\nAs for the EU economic policies, well, it's the result of the EU's decision making process, in which the UK played its part as well. And looking at the Union as a whole it looks to me that the UK is one of the least socially conscious member states.\n\nAnd again, just to reiterate my point from another comment, screwing the lives of 3 million EU citizens in this country as well as a million more British in other EU member states is not exactly a great way of promoting anarchist/socialist ideals.",

In the EU you have to take on a lot of responsibility when you hire someone. The cost to company of an employee is higher, so that affects a lot of roles. In tech roles where you have to also invest in skills and training, that adds a lot of overhead so companies are hesitant to hire permanent staff.\n\n2. There is a trend towards not necessarily hiring immigrant developers, but outsourcing your entire development function to India/Eastern Europe. That means there are far fewer developer jobs per tech company in the UK than there are in the US, specifically the Bay area, because it's much easier for US firms to just hire local guys, even though there's a shortage.\n\n3. London salaries are weird. A mid-level software developer in London will easily match his San Francisco/New York counterpart on a cost-to-company basis, but the average is driven down by the massive difference in salaries between London and everywhere else. A mid-level developer in Birmingham may be lucky to earn \u00a350k, whereas they could easily command \u00a380k in London. This discrepancy makes the average look terrible for the UK but it actually don't be like dis. Ironically where you have the highest number of migrant developers, you also have the highest salaries for developers. \n\n4. Contracting. Contracting in the UK often hides the cost of developer salaries, or is not adequately accounted for in payrolls or industry surveys of earnings for certain positions at certain levels. So what you have is the good developers getting paid bank, on contracts, and not getting counted in the surveys of salaries, and then everyone else reporting their bland permanent salaries. So while a senior dev who does contracts could easily bring in \u00a3125k, the benchmark permanent salary is more like \u00a370k.\n\nContracting in the US doesn't really exist in this sense, because there is no social safety net and it seldom works out better without your employer's health plans, etc. \n\n",

The number of immigrants prepared to do the job has zero impact on what a minimum wage earner gets paid, and the fact that you can earn more than minimum wage making coffee indicates that there is still demand for that labour. \n\nIn fact I'm pretty sure I could find a job as a barrister somewhere within walking distance of my flat in a day or two of searching. I doubt immigration has had any effect on the availability or pay of these jobs. If it did they would all pay minimum wage without exception, and be hard to find. \n\nBut this is missing the point. These immigrants are complimenting the labour pool, not crowding it out. And in doing so they are increasing productivity and spending money locally, which contributes to businesses growing and hiring more people. \n\nArguing that immigrants are taking all of the barrista jobs away from British people, and driving down wages for those jobs, is just ridiculous. \n\nIt's an easy narrative to understand because people see immigrants and they see themselves struggling to find decent paying work, but it breaks down very quickly as soon as you look at the numbers.\n\nIn reality its domestic policy that has kept those wages low, not surplus labour.

    "body": "What kind of source do you mean? This is supremely basic theory of economics stuff. No offence, but I suspect you aren't being genuine in your request. \n\nNo drop in wages for unskilled workers in response to migration is in the linked report. Unskilled workers are on minimum wage, that's a given. Their wages can't drop below that level, basic logic right there. With me so far?\n\nThe fact that the amount an employer will willingly pay in wages is the least they can whilst getting people who can do the job is basic econ. That's why tube drivers insist on closed shop hiring, because people from outside would do it for half the pay. It's why jobs that are oversubscribed and have cachet pay often less than you'd otherwise expect them to. Junior doctors, for example. And firemen. People want to do those jobs for reasons other than making a living.\n\nThe fact that unskilled labour is freely available is again simple logic. A large percentage of Europe is making less money than our minimum wage (or are unemployed), and speaks English. They are all potential candidates.\n\nAnd if people are willing to work for a lower minimum wage in one country, and finding that work isn't even guaranteed, they will move to where the work is. That's literally the model for how the EU functions. Richer countries exploit the labour force of poorer countries in exchange for development funds and market access. And when that poor country reaches a living standard where their youth are no longer leaving for greener pastures, a new former combloc nation is inducted. Or else who will pick our fruit?\n\nSo there is a constant supply of people who will work for minimum wage, meaning that unskilled British labour is never at a premium and never increases in value beyond state-legislated minimums. This is increasing the proportion of workers on minimum wage, expected to reach 10% by 2020 according to [this](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/oct/01/number-of-uk-workers-on-minimum-wage-expected-to-double-by-2020) Guardian piece.

Leaving was a move that required full long-term planning, but they way it has been handled to date means we have a running clock and little in the way of a plausible plan.",

    "body": "> Power should come from below and it should remain as close as possible to those that granted it. The EU doesn't represent that ideal.\n\nNor does Westminster. That's just not how current political systems work. With or without the EU. I personally find that the EU project points toward something more of the internationalist affairs, but of course it does so within the realms of capitalism.\n\nI don't see what's wrong with 'globalisation'. This is one feature of capitalism that could be seen as something to build upon, not fighting it. Capitalism gave rise to nation states to begin with, with level field of national legislation made trade so much easier. Abolishing the fiefdom of lords was a step forward in history, but it has never stopped at national boundaries. It can't stop at national boundaries. Nation-states were only a stepping stone, a temporary vehicle, soon to be exceeded.\n\nMy interpretation of communism/socialism/anarchism is that it acknowledges the fact that it can only exist in a truly global world. Anti-globalism is a nationalistic project by its nature. That's not to say that it doesn't have its negative impact on people. But fighting it by trying to retreat to smaller provinces will not help.\n\nIt's not the EU that's treating workers as commodity. Capitalism does. And that's just how capitalism works. It was the same in the past and remain until capitalism exists. Nothing specific to the EU.\n\n>  while is a nice adventure for a young middle class professional\n\nIt's not just young middle-class professionals. A lot of people found work in the EU where their own country wasn't able to provide that before. The fact that through the EU many Eastern European countries saw rise in their opportunities is not something you can easily dismiss. Besides factories vanished to China before the EU was a thing, and has very little to do with this project, once more.\n\nAlso, unfortunately, the low-skill, low-wage people are in trouble not because of the EU, but because automation is putting huge pressure on the wages all over the world.\n\nWhatever you might think should happen, in practice Brexit means that the many of us found themselves being a bargaining chip in a battle of elites, and target of hatred (by what you describe as \"vulnerable low paid workers\", because they were lead to believe so).\n\nImmigration policy was at the heart of the EU-referendum. Not everybody voted Leave because of immigration, but without that part of voters, Brexit wouldn't have happened. Therefore, the demonisation of immigrants will continue, and will be part of whatever become of the Brexit negotiations.\n\nAs you probably noticed, I'm biased because it affects me, because I'm also an immigrant, though myself from the middle-class professional type (not at all adventurous type though, it was miserable financial situation why I had to leave my country). But many friends, who aren't as well positioned as me currently are feeling uncertain since the Brexit vote, and nothing happened so far that would relieve them.",
