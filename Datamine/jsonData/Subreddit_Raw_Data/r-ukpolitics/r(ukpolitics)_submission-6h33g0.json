Edit: Corbyn went to a private primary school. Emily Thornberry sent her son to a grammar school 14 miles away.

In some cases that may be opposing change (think Thatcher and Section 28, attempting to create a moral and cultural hegemony to avoid subversive cultures undermining traditional values), and in others it might mean you change in order to conserve (Leo von Caprivi's New Course in Germany in the 1890s is a great example of this, worth looking up). The ideology is often marked by opposition to radical change, but overall it is about taking a pragmatic approach to society.\n\nNow whether you think that's all complete bollocks or a sound approach is ideological (I personally don't find much of conservatism to be based in pragmatism), but there is a general misunderstanding over the ideology. It's not the alt-right, it's not fascism, it's a broad political creed that, like most, has been applied to good and bad effect.",

So I addressed this point by asking you what he can no longer afford in real terms.\n\nYou have now flapped and shifted the argument to an economic one (that prices are rising on petrol faster in the UK than elsewhere). You specifically stated that petrol is now difficult to afford for Mr. Smith. I then asked how is this possible, as Petrol was *significantly* more expensive 4 years ago? Are you stating that Mr. Smith could only afford petrol when it was at its 15 year low? And now he can't afford petrol when it is back at its 2012 cost.\n\nYou are talking about a specific persons ability to afford something. \"Voting to make their lives worse\". If he can't afford petrol now, then he definitely could not afford petrol in 2013, (or it had a significantly larger effect on his monthly budget) long before Brexit. \n\n> The average price of a bottle of wine was 16p higher in the 12 weeks leading to march 25 compared to the same period the year before, an increase far outstripping inflation (as per evening standard - can't link on a mobile for some reason). \n\nSo this 16p increase has made his weekly shop unaffordable? Mr Smith has had to change his shopping habits to adjust for this 16p per week (lets times that across 10 items and be generous and make it \u00a31.60 if you'd like) shift? \n\n*You* made the claim that this man's life had been significantly impacted by the current changes in cost of his living expenses. You *did not* make the claim that their is a shift in price that items are generally getting more expensive. I would have agreed with you if you had made that point, as it is empirically true.\n\nWhat I am saying you are misconstruing (deliberately perhaps?), is the impact of said costs. You are pretending that these costs have had significant impacts on the average consumer. I am saying that is total bollocks, as the effects have been minuscule to the point where it would be very difficult to notice a significant impact on monthly outgoings. \n\nThe petrol point however, you totally and utterly pulled out of your arse. Petrol is significantly cheaper than it was 4 years ago. The % rise in contrast with other currency is completely and utterly irrelevant with regard to a consumer, it is still significantly cheaper than it was, so cannot in any terms be judged as something which has made your life unaffordable.\n\n",

It doesn't matter what the price of oil was four years ago. Four years ago the price of oil was sky high, out of this world expensive. It matters what it was a year ago, before Brexit. The price of oil four years ago has NOTHING to do with what effects Brexit might be having. \n\nOver the last four years we saw a massive devaluation of the price of oil. This was somewhat factored into the pump price.\n\nHowever in the last year we've had an increase in the pump price that does NOT correspond with an underlying change in oil prices, that is a result mostly of the drop in the pound that directly resulted from Brexit.\n\n> Stop with your nonsense about global markets and specifically address the point about why the average consumer has been affected significantly by the petrol price reaching its late 2011 cost.\n\n** I don't understand what is so hard to grasp here? If it weren't for Brexit, you'd be paying \u00a35/week less to fill up your car. That's \u00a320/month if you drive moderately, and a big deal. 2011's cost has nothing to do with it, because we're talking about IMMEDIATE effects within 12 months, without wages having the opportunity to compensate ** \n\nMy \"nonsense about global markets\" is highly fucking relevant, and if you don't grasp how global markets affect the UK then you have no business having an argument about the economics of Brexit. Yet here we are. \n\n> So price increases weighted against inflation have a national overall drag on spending habits when pronounced over a long period of time? Yes. Factual macroeconomic statement.\n\nYou're missing the point. The important part is that this increase is larger than the rate of inflation, and is having an impact because of Brexit's effect on the pound.\n\nI never said anything about \"unaffordable\". You used that word. I said \"more expensive\", which is objectively true.\n\nMr Smith would not notice such a big change at first. He may notice that things are getting slightly more expensive but he buys the same food because he buys food and needs to eat. However, at the end of the month he might be a few quid short, and not really able to account for it.\n\nThis shortfall will gradually increase so that he is \u00a320 short at the end of the month, and if you add that to the extra \u00a320 he's paying for fuel, that's a big deal for a low earner. He will avoid making a purchase, which can hurt local businesses as well as large ones, or may take out a payday loan to cover the gap. This puts further strain on him, and on the economy as a whole when this effect is multiplied by 20 million people. \n\nI'll put this real simple so you can understand:\n\n1. The UK is a net importer, unlike many European countries. We buy more foreign goods than we export. \n2. We pay for the things we import in Pounds\n3. The Pound has lost 15% of its value against the Euro since Brexit\n4. That means that importers have been paying 15% more for things they bring in from Europe\n5. They may not have passed those costs on immediately, but are now starting to (in the natural way that importers adjust to price elasticity)\n\nThat's basic economics and you need to grasp the fact that it's not \"just\" a 12p increase in the price of wine. It's a network of cumulative effects that add significant drag to an economy. \n\n",

Better-off vilified is a common meme against Labour, but the only people who would be seeing tax rises under are the top 5%, and their target corporation tax of 26% is still the lowest of the G7. So not really fucking over the rich either, tbh.\n\nMy point is they are fucking over \"the rich\".  Hard Brexit and Higher Taxes.",

Although they're the most popular parties, Sinn Fein and DUP are also the most hated parties. Many will vote DUP only to stop Sinn Fein, many will vote Sinn Feinn only to stop the DUP. \n\nHowever if you're a nationalist in an overwhelmingly unionist area, there's no chance of SDLP or Sinn Fein winning. So you vote UUP, because at least the UUP are better than the DUP. The same goes for unionists in overwhelmingly nationalist areas, they vote SDLP because they're the best chance to stop Sinn Fein.",
