    "body": "Posting the full quote here, seeing as how no one actually reads articles on reddit. The points he makes are very salient indeed. \n\n**David Davis:** There is a proper role for referendums in constitutional change, but only if done properly. If it is not done properly, it can be a dangerous tool. The Chairman of the Public Administration Committee, who is no longer in the Chamber, said that Clement Attlee\u2014who is, I think, one of the Deputy Prime Minister's heroes\u2014famously described the referendum as the device of demagogues and dictators. \n\nWe may not always go as far as he did, but what is certain is that pre-legislative referendums of the type the Deputy Prime Minister is proposing are the worst type of all.\nReferendums should be held when the electorate are in the best possible position to make a judgment. They should be held when people can view all the arguments for and against and when those arguments have been rigorously tested. In short, referendums should be held when people know exactly what they are getting. So legislation should be debated by Members of Parliament on the Floor of the House, and then put to the electorate for the voters to judge.\n\nWe should not ask people to vote on a blank sheet of paper and tell them to trust us to fill in the details afterwards. For referendums to be fair and compatible with our parliamentary process, we need the electors to be as well informed as possible and to know exactly what they are voting for. Referendums need to be treated as an addition to the parliamentary process, not as a substitute for it.",

The quote is presented in a different context as if to insinuate that Brexit voters were not well informed (and by extension Davies is a hypocrit) and I think that\u2019s an unfair comparison to draw. The problem is that whenever you are comparing \u201cthe status quo\u201d with \u201csomething new\u201d then it is inherently difficult to give people as much information about that \u201csomething new\u201d especially when it requires negotiation. \n\nWhen people say voters weren\u2019t well informed it strikes me they are really implying we need some sort of crystal ball before we get a choice on anything. Indeed we don\u2019t know whether staying in the EU would have meant eventual federalisation... let\u2019s face it, if it is then leave would have won by more than 52%... basically the future is inherently unknown and I\u2019m not sure that this whole \u201cthe vote wasn\u2019t well informed, something something about slogans on a bus etc\u201d really helps advance the Brexit debate. \n\n**EDIT: WOW, -24 downvotes in 1 hour.

We are 18 months from the vote and we still have no idea what this weak government wants for the UK. What is the way ahead..how do they see post-Brexit UK? What is their plan to make the UK prosper in the years ahead? \n\nSaying we'll sign multiple trade deals doesn't really cut it for me, especially when it's been suggested that they want to try cut and paste the deals we already have with other countries through the EU to apply to the UK alone. Where is the benefit we were told would come from bespoke trade deals?\n\nI could accept Brexit, even though I personally appreciate what the EU has done for me if the government came out with a solid plan for the road ahead that I could agree with. I could even try to accept it if the government came out with a logical plan that I didn't agree with. What I can't accept is the government winging it without a clue (reports yesterday suggest the cabinet haven't even discussed how the UK will look after we leave yet). \n\nWe could be heading to hell in a handcart and my job, my families security and their future could be going along with it.

Leave or Remain.\n\nFor example, we had no idea at all that May would call an election, lose her majority, and be forced to use an NI unionist party to prop herself up, thus making any question on the Irish border a murky question, thus hanging up trade talks.\n\nYes, I get your point, \"crystal ball\" and all that. But we were being convinced of voting for a concept completely on the concept of principle and ideology with no thought to practicality. I voted Remain but 100% understand the reasons people voted Leave (well, the good federalization based reasons anyway, not the crappy \"take back control I hate immigrants\" reasons), but at that point we were expecting nothing much more than \"we invoke A50 then we're out\". It did not take a crystal ball to know/learn what would be involved in the ongoing negotations, which literally [no-one from the government or advocating for Leave had even thought about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTH3uozfHMM) and apparently with David Davis lying about having done assessments, we're STILL not really thinking about it.\n\nSure, I'm sure there's an argument for blaming the EU for these stalls, not conceding stuff and being firm on their stance, etc., but this is a negotiation, and they have the leverage. We're the ones leaving them, after all.\n\nWe voted for the government to do something with the assumption that they would be able to get it done. A fair assumption, since government should be prepared for both outcomes of a referendum if they're going to offer it. It's seeming day by day more likely that they can't, not at least without completely bricking our economy and relationship with the EU and the rest of the world.\n\nEither the government and Leave campaigners knew this difficulty and kept us uninformed, or they just didn't do their due diligence, which makes them negligent. I'm backing the latter, personally. Either way, we didn't have the whole picture when the referendum was given to us. No-one did, and no-one ever could, since it was a process that had never happened in the history of the EU, marketed to us as \"oh y'know we can just leave\". It's why we should never have had a referendum on it in the first place. Not because we're dumb. Because requiring a crystal ball for 80% of the picture is, in absolutely no reasonable universe, \"informed\", no matter how smart you are.",

It becomes a rorschach test where people fill in what they want. For some, they wanted immigration to stop and they saw Leave as the best way to do it, for others they were more concerned with UK sovereignty, others had misinformed views of EU laws, some thought we'd see more funding for the NHS, etc etc.\n\nWithout specifics Leave voters were able to come together supporting contradictory ideas and Remain couldn't effectively counter that because it was such a general vote. I think whatever the end of Brexit talks, if you took the final agreement and put THAT to a vote, it would never win, and that's ultimately the point Davis was making 15 years ago - you can push unpopular legislation through by using a vague referendum first, legislating after.

I know from personal experience that high schools now dedicate entire lessons to discussing and critically thinking about current affairs which is a vast improvement. You're right that it could be worse but ,ofcourse, we shouldn't judge a system by how much worse it could be.\n\nIn terms of the older generation, I think it's a bit of both, the focus on critical thinking didn't feel as necessary when the degree of information available was a lot smaller before the internet and now it's crucial. The older generation grew up without these tools but it's not like if we get older we are incapable of learning. At the same time, I would argue that even willingness to critically think has to be something you learn. Critical thinking, like going to the gym, is hard, it takes time and resources. While there will some who enjoy it, for the rest of us the only way to do it is to learn to do it a little at a time until it becomes a habit. ",

The political situation is quite nuanced; NI politics doesn\u2019t support Irish reunification at the moment and there isn\u2019t much sign its shifting. Irish politics is entrenched in sectarian divisions that don\u2019t tend to produce big swings in opinion (unlike Scottish independence which is fundamentally a civic movement rather than a sectarian one). The situation in Scotland is that they only just had a referendum and despite SNP landslides in the past they haven\u2019t been able to galvanise public support for a second referendum. Scotland may yet try to leave but I think it\u2019s unlikely - because even if they wanted another referendum only Westminster can allow it, and it\u2019s unlikely they would only a few years after the last one.\n\nThe DUP is a complex topic. It\u2019s worth remembering they only have any political clout in this government, so we are only talking about 5 years (a short time in legislative politics) not forever. I do actually have some sympathy for the DUP because the EU is also pushing for a situation that paves the way for NI to move away from the rUK and that doesn\u2019t respect the GFA either. NI is a delicate balance and I do respect the right of the DUP to protect that balance. Right now we are in the middle of a rock and a hard place, with both sides duking it out. But the DUP will only have that ability for a few years. It\u2019s entirely possible a future government with a stronger majority will simply reverse any agreements with the DUP and steamroll legislation through that affects them. ",

It's called the Single Market, which all EU representatives have consistently repeated is not negotiable. You either allow freedom of movement or are not allowed access. \n\nI think people are wearing rather rose-tinted glasses about both the UK's ability to maintain a working economy outside of this market, and their ability to negotiate the dozens of required trade treaties with every major country or economic bloc. These take years at the best of times, often over a decade. Is the UK really going to keep itself as part of manufacturing and service (both of which go back and forth internationally dozens of times from raw material or marketing idea to finished product)? What does the UK population, under-trained and unproductive, have to offer besides its macroeconomically strategic location? \n\nA UK outside of the Single Market completely will suffer a crippling crisis and quickly become a backwater of incredible inequality and an impoverished population being treated like the US proletariat, with none of the Human Rights protections they currently have. There's a reason why the Tories want the Human Rights Act repealed:\n\nhttps://www.liberty-human-rights.org.uk/human-rights/what-are-human-rights/human-rights-act/human-rights-act-mythbuster\n\nBy the way, there *are* restrictions available for immigration within EU laws, and most Western Europe countries use them, for example:\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dano_v_Jobcenter_Leipzig\n\nThe UK made the *specific* choice not to require any. All of those \"benefit scrounger\" Romanians (a small minority, but one that looks good in tabloid covers) could have been turned away within the margins of EU law by the UK government. The UK government specifically *didn't*, partly because of a neoliberal outlook, but mainly because they wanted to play the bigotry card and whip up the plebs for their own political benefit.\n",

This is the core of the case for leaving the EU, but the leave campaigns never even mentioned it. \n\nYou have researched the \"known unknowns\", but they are still unknown. Would you have been happy with any of the range of options from EEA membership to 'no deal'? Would other leave voters? \n\nYou mention empathy and go on to accept that there may well be a significant cost for individuals and businesses. How do you think the people who have to pay that cost for an outcome they didn't want will react? If your local authority CPOs your house to build a road, that's a decision made by a democratically elected body, nominally for the greater good, but you'll still be compensated.

That's broadly what all the noise has been about since the referendum though isn't it? People have been making  a lot of noise to try and pressure the government into taking one stance or another.  \n\nAs to a slow and minor removal from the EU, that depends on what the EU wants to allow and what the UK government sees as important. Given we are leaving the EU, we still need to balance the benefits and the costs. There is little point in going for a slow and minor exit, if that leaves the UK in a worse position than a more complete exit would.  At this point it is about finding the 'best' outcome after all, and as we can see there are a lot of different views on that.  But then that's why we have Parliament and MPs representing us, to have a say in that, set the direction and get the best possible exit so that the UK can take advantage of having left the EU.\n\nOh and I doubt that you'll find many people that want to see an exit process that does anything more than as little damage as possible.

That would mean less immediate change, but obviously change in the future (the EU needs it if nothing else, and the EU, like everything else isn't static). It was a somewhat known quantity.  But the vote was to remain in the EU, not 'for things to continue as they are'.\n\n>Leave still isn't clear what leaving involves now..\n\nVoters knew that their vote would lead to the UK leaving the EU. The specifics of that process and the ongoing relationship were far less clear than remaining, it was a vote for a change.  To a certain extent the exact outcome is unknowable, because it relies on the EU's agreement as much as anything else.  The point however was that people wanted the UK to leave the EU and they knew that would involve the government having to work through both the exit and the future relationship.\n\n>so how people know we what they were voting for then I don't understand.\n\nBecause you are trying to tie it into a specific outcome, or set of outcomes. Given that those outcomes depend on a negotiation with the EU you could argue that it is never possible to vote in an informed manner to leave the EU, because you feel that the aim of leaving the EU isn't sufficient in and of itself.\n\nSurely you see that that doesn't make a lot of sense? I mean when people voted to remain in the EEC in 1975 they didn't know exactly what they were voting for, they couldn't have been expected to. The same goes broadly for the Scottish independence referendum, or any future vote in Northern Ireland (and Ireland..). The moment you have a vote that triggers a process with other parties involved, you can really only set the direction and shop some of the possibilities (for the EEC it was for an economic, social and political union that was still forming, for Scotland it was for an independent Scotland based on a vision from the Scottish Government, in Ireland it will be based on any number of visions for a united Ireland).  Whether the promises can be delivered, where there are compromises, where practicality and political realities collide there will always be difference.\n\nBut the idea that you can't decide whether the UK should continue as part of the EU or not, when you know what the EU is, how it works, and what the broad aspirations and direction of travel are, because you don't know exactly what the exit process might end up with is a bit silly.\n\nWe'd all like certainty, remain may have given us a little more of it, but at the end of the day, you don't need certainty to make a decision on a principle.

Hmm.\n\nLet's stay on the debate and then come back to your points.\n\nThe main point - under debate here - is that the electorate were not well informed and *not clear on what they were voting for* since there was no clear definition of what leaving the EU meant. As we have clearly seen there are many many definitions of what Brexit might entail. Some of which are contradictory to other commitments (eg. NI).\n\n>It\u2019s impossible to see the future\n\nSimplistic crap. It's *impossible* to *perfectly* predict the future.\nIt's perfectly possible to predict many useful aspects of the future even if it's not perfect and mistakes occur. \nThere were many aspects of Brexit that were pretty well predicted. \n\n(As an aside, yes yes, we can debate that the immediate crash has not happened to the extent forecast. You know what, even that's instructive to behavioural economics. Economists failed to understand the circular logic that if a majority of ~~the population~~ voters thought Brexit was a good idea then they would also think there was no economic issue and carry on spending which has so far carried the economy.... rather like in a cartoon where bugs bunny has run over a cliff and defies gravity by carrying on running for a while. I'm still pretty confident that economic 'gravity' - especially macro-economics and trade flow - is well enough understood.)\n\nBringing this point back the point of the debate, we could have modelled and considered the impact of all the major Brexit scenarios. Even if the forecasts were not perfect we could still have understood the *relative* merits of each pretty well.\n\nYour approach is just justifying jumping off a cliff....\n\n>that doesn\u2019t mean sticking with the status quo for.. reasons\n\nCompletely different argument. I'd be the first to agree that the UK is not perfect and there are many things that need to be changed.\nBurning down the house is not a good approach...",

The plain fact is that the immigration we had was very good for the economy as a whole, which is indisputable.

Nobody is suggesting letting every African or Asian into the country. The EU workers come because there are jobs available, when the jobs availability is low, they move on. They are here to work, not shirk for the vast majority. In that way, the market is self-regulating. Brexit will lower that availibility and more will move on to a more attractive location.\n\nAgain, you're using the current economic conditions and saying \"what's the problem\". I'm asking you to think about future scenarios, and to show you there are also unknown variables on the Remain side. Tomorrow, a recession might hit southern/Eastern Europe. Immigration triples. Why aren't you engaging with me? Do you concede that \"immigration is good for the economy\" is we had complete open borders with India, Pakistan and Bangladesh, for example? It's not a \"gotcha\" question, I want you to concede that although immigration may have been a benefit to us *so far to this point in time*, it doesn't logically follow that it will always be so.

It all came up in the campaigns, never mind the period before hand. I mean, fair enough, it's up to you what you discard as inaccurate, but it certainly isn't inaccurate to say that various models were discussed.\n\nAs to the point on Cameron and the civil service, that's not something that's up for debate, it was discussed at the time and criticised since.\n\n>only a small minority and only at a high level of single market means no border.\n\nIt was at a high level (that is to say discussing the general shape of access and so on rather than detail) but that's broadly to be expected given the detail would depend on any number of aspects, including the EU's approach.  Various approaches were talked about by different groups at different times \n to different levels of detail though.\n\nAs to the single market, there was discussion that ranged from remaining in it, through to trading on WTO terms.  Most of the debate seemed to focus on some level of access (Rather then membership) of the market, which seems to be both the current Government and opposition positions.\n\n>There was and is no detailed look at any of the broad outcomes made available to the electorate, that's a fact evidenced by what's happening in the commons.\n\nYou'd be right to say that the civil service were not instructed (by the government, which recommended remain) to put together outcomes or contingencies. That is because they were instructed specifically not to work on the issues with ministers who leaned toward leave either.\n\n>The last part about the government being the only ones who haven't assessed the impact is just rubbish. Just look at all the volume of false, contradictory or downright delusion comments and media articles about what's on offer. \n\nCompanies have looked at contingencies and outcomes, both the campaigns looked at outcomes (and presented them, both as possibilities and as nightmare scenarios) there are several different broad models from several different NGO's modelling the financial aspects depending on a variety of factors. Again, some of the latter have been used by both the leave and remain supporting people during, and since the referendum.  You are right that there is a lot of contradictory stuff out there, and a lot of delusional content (Again from remain and leave supporters), but that is also the nature of this debate. Different people want different exit scenarios, the only thing that tied the leave vote together was wanting the UK out of the EU after all (in much the same way that remain voters voted on a slew of reasons, with the common denominator being remaining in..).\n\n>Clearly not made by people with an understanding or accurate assessment.\n\nIf what you were expecting was a single outcome, explained in detail, then you are right. That didn't exist before the referendum. If you are looking for one now, you can look through the Governments negotiating positions, there is a shape of what the Government would like there, the problem (As it was always going to be) is that it also has to run into the shape the EU would like (also published essentially..) and they aren't quite the same.\n",
