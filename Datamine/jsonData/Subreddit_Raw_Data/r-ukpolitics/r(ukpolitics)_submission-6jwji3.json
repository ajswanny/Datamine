    "body": "Here you go\n\nThe DUP has secured the promise of a law designed to shield British security forces from prosecution over Troubles killings as part of its agreement to prop up the Conservative government.\n\nIn the document published yesterday which outlined the \u00a31 billion (\u20ac1.1 billion) deal between the two parties, a provision called \u201clegacy\u201d indicated that a new law would be passed blocking criminal cases against soldiers and police for unlawful killings during the Troubles. The Irish government has said that any such law would breach the Stormont House agreement.\n\nThe section stated that the UK government will seek to work with the Northern Ireland executive to implement the legacy bodies in the agreement but it will do so in ways \u201cwhich do not unfairly focus on former members of the armed forces or police. Both parties reiterate their admiration for the courage and sacrifice of the police and armed forces in upholding democracy and the rule of the law and will never forget the debt of gratitude that we owe them.\u201d\n\nThere was also a mention of a \u201cfair, balanced and proportionate\u201d response to legacy issues, which is a reference to wording in the Stormont House agreement. DUP and Tory backbenchers claim that the reference allows for Westminster to pass a law granting amnesty to any party accused of a crime during the Troubles.\n\nIrish ministers have written to James Brokenshire, the Northern Ireland secretary, and said that there is no provision in the agreement which allows for such a law.\n\nCharlie Flanagan, the foreign affairs minister until last week, has previously dismissed the suggestion that legacy agreements could be used to protect anyone from being prosecuted. \u201cI believe there should be no amnesties, no exemptions,\u201d he said in May. \u201cWe move forward along the lines of the Stormont House agreement, which sets out a clear framework for dealing with the very sensitive issue of the past.\u201d\n\nLast year two former soldiers were told that they would be prosecuted for murder over the death in 1972 of Joe McCann, a commander in the Official IRA. There have also been reports that up to 18 soldiers could be charged in relation to the Bloody Sunday shootings, when 14 people died after members of the Parachute Regiment opened fire on civil rights protesters in Derry in January 1972. David Cameron described the killings as unjustified and unjustifiable after an inquiry in Britain found the victims were innocent.\n\n",

Infact, after reading your comment, i'm willing to bet on it.\n\nAnd the pound is supported alone by the dollar is it? What are you on about?\n\nWhat does obesity have to do with funding the NHS? Are you implying that rising obesity is the reason that the NHS is too expensive to service? The real reason is more largely to do with Private finance initiatives that were taken out in the past that have now added to the cost of the NHS in order to service the loan repayments. And to a smaller extent an ageing population.\n\nI'm glad you have such a good understanding of all of this complex stuff, so plebs like me don't need to worry about researching it for ourselves. I never knew that exercise was so important to staying healthy!\n\nI'm not even going to try to decipher why I'm responsible for Diane Abbot having diabetes, Sorry.\n\nThanks for helping me grow up though!",

High Tories are corporatist and statist, he is economically liberal.\n\n> The Conservatives do not lower taxes.\n\nMay doesn't, and the Overton window is so far to the left at the moment that it's difficult to actually decrease statism - the only thing voting May can achieve is slowing down the increase in statism compared to Labour/Lib Dems.

By cutting services you either put yourself in the position to lower taxes, or you lower the deficit which would otherwise have increased future spending and therefore future taxes.\n\n> is that not a bigger instance of statist theft?\n\nHow? The amount stolen by the government in this example stays the same.  \nAlso, the government already spends more than it takes in, eliminating the deficit is as necessary as lowering taxes.\n\n> She should have produced something worth voting for.\n\nYes, she should have.\n\n> Democracy is probably the best demonstration of the free market outside of economics\n\nIt's not. Agents in a free market cannot impose their will by force onto others. Democracies are dictatorships of the majority that operate by force.\n\n> Her manifesto was a mess of big state authoritarianism\n\nIndeed, she's probably the worst Tory leader in decades.

Were I an idealistic ancap I would see no difference, but in practice it costs so little that it's not worth the fight, once we privatise healthcare, education, and pensions and eliminate unemployed benefits I'll be more than satisfied.\n\n",
