    "body": "The DUP are led by White (mostly male) Christian Conservative fundamentalist of the US bible-belt kind. They oppose LGBT equality laws like same-sex marriage (Northern Ireland is the only place in the UK where there is no same-sex marriage) or banning gay conversion. They support creationism and oppose LGBT education. Hostile to ethnic minorities, wishing to 'get them ethnics out' and support the current law in Northern Ireland which bans abortion even if the woman has been raped by a stranger or family member. \n\nThe European Courts of Human Rights (which is our version of the US supreme court in Europe) has struck down this ban but they are refusing to change the law, so they are given a chance to change the law or face major fines and backlash etc. Not to mention they have a recent history of being sectarian, treating Christinas as the 'lesser' version of Christianity. it's a nightmare. This is all before I mention they have historical roots and by historical I mean within 10 years, to right-wing terrorism.\n\nAnother similarity, which I don't mean to be rude to people who live in these areas. As you do find poverty and low-income households everywhere etc. But they are living in (people in Northern Ireland) in one of the poorest parts of the UK. It has some of the worst employment figures, highest crime, low education levels, low personal income and low life expectancy. Which is, based on information I've seen from my little years studying (and following) American politics and speaking to American friends is basically what the Deep South is like compared to the coastal areas in California and New York state. Broadly speaking of course!\n\nThe mainstream in the UK is not use to religion and politics mixing. Even from Liberal people. For example, one politician who is a LIBERAL Christian, was a leader of one of our big political parties but resigned because even though he campaigned AND voted for same-sex marriage could not say if he thought it was a sin or not when interviewed. He got so much backlash from the media, social media and other politicians during the election he ended up resigning after.\n\nSo you see, the UK really doesn't not mix religion and party politics so well lol.",
