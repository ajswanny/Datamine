I spent over a month in Sweden, (dated a Swede, so i stayed with his family) and essentially every house had a flag. \n\nIt could be a rural/urban divide, because Gothenburg did have fewer flags around than the villages we would pass through, but there's certainly more Swedish flags around than British/English flags. \n\nThe Swedes are a quietly nationalistic people. They just think they innately do everything better than everyone else. I remember my ex's sister saying she could never pursue a career outside of Sweden, because the sexism was so bad everywhere else she'd be held back. Not remotely true, but there was just an unchallenged sense of superiority in much of what they did or thought of their country. \n\nAnd I'll append to this the fact that I know Swedish, and still routinely read the media from Sweden. It wasn't a 'their family was racist' thing, but a pretty endemic feeling you can pick up. Quoting 'flag rules', which are as binding as the US flag code aka not, doesn't invalidate any of that. I also don't much see how the pennent is a million miles away from a flag?",

We sing our anthem before football (gridiron and soccer) games. I hate that. A lot of people hate it.\n\nBut my neighbor flys a flag cause he was in the navy. I respect that. Another neighbor has a 20 foot flagpole, and flys the American flag, cause her husband is on duty in the navy. I respect that too, despite my feelings. Same nationalism, different context.",

Britain and France goaded Poland into changing alliances (and our idiotic foreign minister J\u00f3zef Beck agreed) with promises of defence for purely geopolitical reasons, to surround Germany with enemies.\n\nThen, when Germany invaded, Britain formally \"declared war\" but did nothing until France was invaded, while it could have ended the war in months by striking the undefended German western border.\n\nIn other words, Britain didn't go to war \"to defend Poland\". Britain actually doomed Poland by tricking it into an alliance that was advantageous for Britain and foolish for Poland. Britain went to war to defend British interests against the growing German power, which is a reason I fully respect.\n\nIt is my opinion that the duty of a national leader is to do what is best for their country, which is why I do not blame Churchill and his predecessor for their manoeuvring.  \nI blame the Polish political class for playing their hand terribly and dooming us to defeat.",

I could apply your logic to any number of situations.  \nThe Swastika was originally a hindu symbol does that mean hindus are nazis?  \nBritain first have been trying to hijack the poppy. Does that mean anyone who wears a poppy on remembrance day is a Britain first sympathiser.  \nThey also sell Yorkshire roses on their website. Are the people of Yorkshire automatically Britain first sympathisers.  \nYou see just because two completely separate groups of people use a symbol it doesn't mean that both groups are identical.  \n  \n\"This is a peculiarly British thing. Flying a French or German flag isn't that common for individuals to do in France and Germany, but wouldn't have the same level of meaning. The Scottish flag has a separate meaning too, this time of Scottish independence, stirred up largely by the recent referendum.\"  \nWell by the logic you previously used wouldn't the French flag be deemed as nationalistic? I've seen a lot of Front national supporters waving French flags at rallies. I guess anyone who waves a French flag is a Front National sympathiser.  \n  \n\"Flying a flag isn't racist, but racists are more likely to fly flags. People may get their correlation wrong and assume you are racist.\"  \nI could apply this logic to numerous situations to.  \nBeing Pakistani doesn't make you a paedophile, but pakistanis are more likely to be paedophiles.  \nBeing black doesn't make you violent, but blacks are more likely to commit violent crime.  \nBeing white doesn't make you a fraudster, but whites are more likely to commit fraud.  \nI guess i should start assuming all pakistanis are nonces, all blacks are going to try and stab me and all whites are fraudsters.",

    "body": ">Poland used to be allied with Germany in the decades leading to WWII. Britain and France goaded Poland into changing alliances (and our idiotic foreign minister J\u00f3zef Beck agreed) with promises of defence for purely geopolitical reasons, to surround Germany with enemies.\n\nPoland was never allied with Germany. Until 1934, there were constant border disputes and a quasi trade war. Poland entered an alliance with France in 1921 in the aftermath of their war with the USSR because they were (rightfully) fearful that Germany and the USSR would unite to attack them. In 1934, Poland and Germany signed a non-aggression pact (which is not an alliance) while Poland were still allied with France. In 1939, Germany demanded that Poland cede Danzig and the Polish Corridor (both of which were inhabited by lots of Germans who probably wanted to be in Germany) and Poland refused (as it had every right to) for which Germany invaded it. \n\n>Then, when Germany invaded, Britain formally \"declared war\" but did nothing until France was invaded, while it could have ended the war in months by striking the undefended German western border.\n\nThe French launched an offensive in the Saar but it fizzled out because the French military was not prepared for war at all. Their entire preparation for war was centred around defending against Germany and using superior power at sea and economically to suffocate them, like in World War 1, the difference being that this time they had the iron and coalfields in Alsace Lorraine. The BEF planning was based around fighting alongside the French Army, so they couldn't act unilaterally as it would be suicidal. \n\nHow you can blame Poland for defending its territorial integrity in the face of an expansionist nation whose repeated cries of \"this is our last demand\" rang hollow, instead of blaming the Nazis is beyond me.

IT ISN'T. The people and the country are SEPARATE.  \nFor example I hate the Russian Government but ADORE the Russian people, you ever been there? They're fun and hella hospitable but Putin's government is a terrifying corrupt beast. Can you see how an opinion of one is not an opinion of the other?  \n\nI live in the UK because I am British and I want to contribute to the cool parts of the UK; that is, the people. The people who pressured the government to abolish slavery, the people who voted in the welfare state after WW2. The people are the good bit and the old money and vested interests that sail under the flag are often the bad bits. The people abolish slavery and the money and interests just switch to indentured labour which is effectively the same thing. That interaction is a microcosm of the sorts of problems with the global Empire. The interests abroad could ignore the will of the British people at home because of how vast it was and how slow information travelled at the time. All those wankers in the far corners of the Empire claimed what they did was for the \"good of the Empire\" when really they were mostly just lining their pockets.",

But a whole army trained specifically to fight Russians? We'd have taken Stalingrad and Moscow and destroyed communism once and for all.\n\nInb4: \"but the nazis were assholes, working with them is wrong!\". Yeah, so were the Soviets, and yet the Allies had no problem working with them. It was a matter of survival.\n\nThe result was that we'd have retaken Ukraine while letting the Germans have Russia for their \"Lebensraum\". And then we'd have waited letting the Germans fight on the western front.\n\nEventually the allies would be about to defeat them, either through superior US industrial output or through nukes. Then we would have accepted the obvious Allied offer to switch sides and strike the nazis from the east in exchange for the right to keep the lands we recovered from the times of the First Republic and perhaps a piece of Germany while we were at that, ending the war as the only major power in Eastern Europe.\n\nThis was the only course of action that would have led us to victory in WWII, and it was not a difficult one to figure out. The failure to do so for reasons of \"honour\" doomed us to defeat.\n\nFor more on this subject, I suggest a translation of \"Pakt Ribbentrop-Beck\" by Piotr Zychowicz https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pact_Ribbentrop_-_Beck .\n\nedit: I just noticed the \"instead of blaming the Nazis\" bit.\n\nThe Germans have always been assholes in our history, there's no use in \"blaming\" them.

The Poles rejected German offers of partnership because it amounted to being a rump client state who existed at the whim of German will, and would have involved (though they probably didn't know) rounding up your own Jewish population just as Romania, Hungary, Italy and all the other Nazi collaborators did. \n\n>It is often said that \"Hitler missed just one division at Stalingrad\". But a whole army trained specifically to fight Russians? We'd have taken Stalingrad and Moscow and destroyed communism once and for all.\n\nNobody who has a clue thinks they missed just one division at Stalingrad. They were horrifically overextended in their lines, had multiple overarching objectives that demanded resource investment and the planning that went into the invasion of the USSR was horrendous. The Germans expected the Soviets to raise 2,000,000 additional men between the start of Barbarossa and winter. They raised 4,000,000 in the first ten days and a further 3,000,000 by the end of the year. \n\n>The result was that we'd have retaken Ukraine while letting the Germans have Russia for their \"Lebensraum\". And then we'd have waited letting the Germans fight on the western front.\n\nhttps://www.wwnorton.com/college/history/ralph/ralimage/map36wii.jpg\n\nSo Germany has its Lebensraum and just allows this huge area of good land to be stuck in the middle of it? It surrenders Ukraine, the \"breadbasket of Europe\" to a nation with the biggest Jewish population in the world despite Ukraine being some of the best \"living space\" east of the Vistula? \n\nYou can't wax lyrical about the proud Polish history of defiance and the love and devotion to Polish peoples then say your country should have surrendered to the Germans, become a quasi satellite state and become complicit in targeted genocide of its own people.
