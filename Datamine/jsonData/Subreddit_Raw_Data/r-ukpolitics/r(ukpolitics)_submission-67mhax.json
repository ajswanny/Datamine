Now, perhaps more than ever in the history of the nation, we need a strong opposition. And instead we get a man who is quite spectacularly ill-suited for a position of national leadership.\n\nAnd sure, you can cry about how he gets a rough deal from the right-wing press - which is true. But if he was  a half-decent leader he'd be able to at the very least make some political capital out of that. \n\nBut instead he just whinges limply about how things are unfair while the Tories run rampant. If he genuinely gives a shit about securing a place for progressive politics in the future UK he'd step down. But he and his fans are too busy whipping themselves up into an onanistic fury of self-righteousness that he won't ever consider it. \n\nAnd so we're all fucked.",

Their current policy is far more moderate than their private policy ideals, but having someone in the country who is against most of our important energy and defence strategies elected into power, simply isn't the best idea. Corbyn was a Eurosceptic who had to lead the largest Pro-European party into a referendum, and the best he could muster is that he is 7/10 in favour of the EU.\n\nI'm voting Labour as it's best chance for opposition, I think the policy is generally great and at the end of the day you support your local MP and no one past it.

You only really get rid of terrorists in the long run by sympathising with them, understanding and addressing their concerns.\nEmeline Pankhurst and the suffragettes were terrorists. So were Malcolm X and the Black Panthers.\nUnfortunately, very few times has non-violent direct action actually achieved anything without some violent direct action attached.\nI think he's quite clearly stated that he abhors all violence and violent means.

My personal highlight is missing the emergency protest against the brexit bill that he'd organised because he was busy in the house of commons voting in favour of the bill. That's a crisis that didn't need to exist at all. \n\nThe terrorist sympathising is a problem because he was supporting groups who were murdering innocent UK citizens. That's not an acceptable position to take. You can't lead a country if you think that it's all right for some of the people you represent to be murdered if it helps another country make a point.

Secondly, what does their party (if affiliated) include in their manifesto on the national level?\n\nMy vote therefore effectively counts towards two things. First, who I want to be my local MP and secondly, which party do I want to run the country. Now, FPTP is a broken system in this regard as my one vote counts for two separate things, but that's the system we've got and there's no point discussing required changes there at this juncture. \n\nSo yes, what the party's intend to do with *my* country is definitely something that gets taken into account when I cast my vote. \n\n> To then admit that the debates have a disproportionate impact upon voting habits is to admit that they are unsuitable for our democracy, so thanks for supporting my stance.\n\nWhat are you smoking? I said tv debates have an impact on over a third of the country. Similar research shows that tv news coverage influence ~25% and party political broadcasts affect ~10%.

Labour are getting a new leader soon... but an electoral wipeout could see Labour with too steep a hill to climb for 2022. So I encourage you to join the anti-Corbyn Labour voters. Especially if you know your local candidate to be against Corbyn.\n\nI am excited about what I am seeing from the non-Corbynite Labour Party. Some excellent MPs in the Labour Party appear to be putting together a pluralist vision for Labour post-Corbyn.

The print media isn't neutral in the UK, it has never been but the last few years have been particularly bad (and Ed had similar issues, albeit not to the same degree, so did Brown for that matter). It's not as though Cameron didn't have issues with the media either, the difference was the level of competence shown in managing narratives and presenting things.\n\nNow I get that Corbyn wanted to do things differently, but he failed miserably in that regard, even a lot of the Labour/Corbyn social media efforts are incredibly poor. You can't simply shift the blame to the media.\n\nAs to Ed, he was presented as less electable, but the Miliband Labour party  was nowhere near the territory that the party under Corbyn is in now.\n\n",

    "body": "ok, if you want it out of the context of an opinion piece, here's the direct quote from Hansard:\n\n> Mr. Corbyn: \"Does the hon. Gentleman accept that some of us oppose the agreement for reasons other than those that he has given? We believe that the agreement strengthens rather than weakens the border between the six and the 26 counties, and those of us who wish to see a United Ireland oppose the agreement for that reason.\"\n\nnow the question of whether he was right to back Sinn Fein and was right to oppose a negotiated peace is up for debate i guess, but it is what he did.\n\nMcDonnell was still against a peace settlement in 1998!\n\n>Supporting the same aims as the IRA doesn't necessarily mean you endorse their methods either.\n\nI agree, but there a lots of people who support a united ireland who didnt support the IRA, not least the SDLP who actually got about trying to find some kind of negotiated settlement.",

    "body": "yeah you're probably right all over. \n\nTo be fair, maybe May not being there will lead to the attacks that should really be being made by labour towards the tories. \n\nThe tories never shy away from saying how terrible everything WOULD be if labour were in charge, but for some reason labour don't seem that focused on how terrible things ARE. I normally disagree with this approach but I think swathes of the general public are so accepting of the offered scapegoats that they don't realise (or choose to ignore) there are people making decisions that are leading to all the issues around them.\n\nSo many people have such huge problems with Corbyn that at this point they should put at least some time into the 'better of two evils' approach. Sadly I'm not sure Corbyn has the self-awareness to really grasp this somehow. ",

On Andrew Marr he said \"we need to seek political solutions to these issues\", which is correct and is a refreshing change of pace from the gung-ho attitudes of his forebears. I imagine his view is that any and all intervention is morally suspect, but being the leader of a party and not a president means his view is far from the only view, and he would and should listen to his colleagues in that regard.",
