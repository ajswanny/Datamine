People these days insist partition was forced on British India, when it was more complicated than that. The original British plan was 10 year state-based rule, they could then decide to split, but Gandhi wasn't agreeing to that. One of the driving factors behind partition was the Pakistan Movement, that wanted the right to self-determination for Muslims and was successful in gaining independence for the whole region. The lines drawn on the map was devised by two committees of 5 people, only one of which was British (Radcliffe, who was on both committees), the others representing the Muslim League (wanting the right for self-determination for Muslims) and the Indian National Congress (wanting the right to self-determination for Indians, led by Gandhi). Unfortunately the Indian/Pakistani members of the committees hated each-other with such passion that they would barely even talk, and nobody would agree to extend the deadline of deciding how to split the country.",

There's a lot of stuff that could be spun back at you - the deaths of migrants crossing the sea , the treatment of Greece, the sabre rattling with Russia. You probably don't like much of that, but if leave voters occupied positions of cultural, social, political and economic power the narrative would be that you morally validated all those things and it's you that's the bad person. \n\nPart of the reason MPs refer to each other as 'my honourable friend' is to reinforce that when it's comes to political decisions for the country we should all start with the assumption that, even if people disagree with us, they are putting forward their opinion because they thinks it's what is best for the country and all it's people. Not that they disagree with us because they're morally bankrupt. \n\n\n",

This is why India has no future and still today despite being home to over 1 billion people has a smaller economy than a tiny island like Britain.\n\nAnd you haven't answered the question.

The simple truth is that everyday Indians had always been animalistic, uneducated oppressed slaves to whatever ruling class was in power, even when that was other Indians. This is why the caste system still exists in India.\n\n>And European were so fasciniated by out silly civilization , they were crying to be associated with Indo-something.

A key factor behind Britain's early successes and eventual hegemony was the 'divide and rule' strategy and seizing territory via back channels and loopholes. This required seeding conflicts and taking sides, as well as being somewhat tolerant towards India's diversity and maintaining cordial relations with a huge number of tiny princely states and their rulers. A more aggressive and brutal power, like Spain or Portugal, would have also led to an earlier unification against foreign rule and much larger mass uprisings, and it's very unlikely they would have retained the entire country. In contrast, UK's style was more hands-off, and greatly aided by the fact that they developed a British-educated middle-class that loved the Crown. A significant portion of the elites and princes also sent their children to the UK for their education. The Congress, the leading pro-independence faction, was initially formed by a Britisher, and for a long time was aimed at more autonomy and Dominion Status within the Commonwealth. Full independence only came into the picture a lot later.\n\n\n\n\n> It's irrelevant to compare British actions to a moral benchmark\n\n\n\n\nThis applies across history.

Lee.\u201d\n\n> To Edward Bonekemper III, the author of \u201cHow Robert E.

Meanwhile, prominent Southerners set out on a spin offensive, forming the Southern Historical Society, which published hundreds of papers telling its side of the war and shaping its history.\n\n> \u201cAll the Confederacy needed was a stalemate, which would confirm its existence as a separate country,\u201d Bonekemper wrote. \u201cThe burden was on the North to defeat the Confederacy and compel the return of the eleven wayward states to the Union.\u201d\n\n> Lee\u2019s ineptitude was most damaging at Gettysburg.\n\n> On the third day of battle, in what became known as Pickett\u2019s Charge, Lee ordered his troops across an open field, subjecting them to heavy fire.

The rebels suffered more than 6,000 casualties.\n\n> Lee apologists blamed Longstreet\u2019s execution of the attack, which many historians and military strategists now find laughable.\n\n[The truth about Confederate Gen.

Europe had already been home to advanced civilisations such as the Greeks and Romans over 2000 years before colonialism began.\n\n>Europe uses developed because it used foreign culture and technology . Even now you use numbers system from India . You worship an arab and preach Arabian morals.\n\nEurope is developed because of the legacy of ancient Greece and Rome which was restored after the 'Dark Ages' and the Black death. As shown by ['The Great Divergence'](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/44/Maddison_GDP_per_capita_1500-1950.svg), the rest of the world had stagnated while Europe began to boom before colonialism even began.\n\nEuropean morals come in part from the bible and in part from European philosophy going back from Socrates in ancient Greece to Hobbes in civil war England to French revolution Rousseau and more, collectively forming and balancing the western ideals of individual liberty and freedom.\n\n>Thats great coming from British who are most worst genocides and murders in human history . You wiped out entire native population from Australia to America\n\nThe native Americans and aboriginals of Australia died from European diseases that they had not developed immunity to because of their isolation. The same thing happened when Europeans died when first going inland into Africa and contracted diseases like sleeping sickness.\n\n>Now British is just tiny Island begging EU to respect and being lap dog to USA .\n\nThe UK is a great power with global military capabilities far beyond that of China or India. It has nuclear weapons, a permanent seat at the United Nations Security Council, consistently ranks in first or second place in terms of soft power, is a cultural superpower behind only the USA, with British literature, art, film and music enjoyed by a global audience, with for example [British musicians being responsible for 1 in 6 global album sales](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-36332019).\n\nIndia could fall into civil war, sink into the ocean or vanish overnight and no one would give a crap. The only noticeable change would be that it'd start to smell better.",

Napoleon sent his Old Guard straight down the middle subjecting them to withering fire from three directions at Waterloo, does that invalidate his victories like Austerlitz?\n\nA stalemate would have been terrible for the South, as the Union would just increase its already large advantage in terms of logistics. The idea that the Union would ever have peace with the Confederacy is frankly laughable",
