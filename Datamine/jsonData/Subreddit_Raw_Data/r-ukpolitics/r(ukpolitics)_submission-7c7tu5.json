The second Boris is sacked the would be free to plot a more aggressive plan against May, undermining her most of all in the EU negotiations. After these fail (i.e. a bad deal is struck, which I strongly believe is what May thinks, along with the vast majority of competent politicians), he would go around howling to the 4 winds about how his sacking led to the situation. Although this is nonsense, remember that many people will be persuaded by the argument solely because he is the Foreign Secretary and so in an apparent position of power (very little in actuality) regarding foreign affairs, including EU negotiations. \nThe main responsibility for this whole situation is May who, probably, naively thought that by making him Foreign Secretary she would get rid of him in the short term: having more international duties would see him away from his fellow plotters, but in actuality, the position seems to have only heightened his ambitions.

Seth Rich discovered the source of the leak and knew Imran Awan was responsible so he was rubbed out.  \n  \nPapadopolis is a dufus that was approached by the Russian-friendly operative, Joseph Mifsud, and believed everything said and done was above board. Brexit is certainly in the interest of Russia as weakening the EU is in their interest.  \n  \nIt remains unclear if Mueller can be trusted.

Your statement above suggests that they are just making important statements about Johnson without any backing from Johnson himself, which is pretty extraordinary.\n\nConsidering what has happened this week with Pritti Patel obfuscating and misleading through omission to push her personal, secret agenda, I'd say that you're being deliberately obtuse about the difference between a minister's department statement and a minister's statement.\n\nOf course, he may just have attended the meeting for reasons unconnected to Johnson. But he may not have, as well, and breezy dismissals like yours have been heard all along the way of this story about what foreign influence is at hand behind the scenes, and hiding in plain sight. \n\nPersonally, I think we should stop respecting the best intentions of a man who has shown himself to be acting more out of personal ambition than desire for the public good for many years, and has managed to work his way into the heart of crucial political processes and government.\n\nIf you simply trust in the innocence and purity of Boris Johnson, who has demonstrated time and again that he does not respect those qualities, then why should we respect your opinion?

But even if we accepted your 6:4 administrations ratio, is the conviction ratio anywhere near 3:2?\n\n(Psst: 28 years : 25 years ; 120 indictments : 3 indictments ; 89 convictions : 1 conviction.  So, at least in the US, \u201cthey are all corrupt\u201d isn\u2019t a very satisfying counter-argument to stories like this one.)\n\nE: took out a dig and fixed mistakes, which I\u2019m surprised nobody caught. I attribute that to the other side realizing that it\u2019s hard to defend this stuff and the corrections paint a worse picture \u2014 eg a 75% conviction rate for Republicans and a 33% rate for Democrats, but the sample size for Democrats is probably too small to draw any conclusions from their numbers.",

    "body": "\u201cI made a comment recently where I claimed that Republican administrations had been much more criminally corrupt over the last 50 plus years than the Democrats. I was challenged (dared actually) to prove it. So I did a bit of research and when I say a bit I mean it didn\u2019t take long and there is no comparison.\n\nWhen comparing criminal indictments of those serving in the executive branch of presidential administrations, it\u2019s so lopsided as to be ridiculous. Yet all I ever hear about is how supposedly \u201ccorrupt\u201d the Democrats are. So why don\u2019t we break it down by president and the numbers?\n\nObama (D) \u2013 8 yrs in office. Zero criminal indictments, zero convictions and zero prison sentences. So the next time somebody describes the Obama administration as \u201cscandal free\u201d they aren\u2019t speaking wishfully, they\u2019re simply telling the truth.\n\nBush, George W. (R) \u2013 8 yrs in office. 16 criminal indictments. 16 convictions. 9 prison sentences.\n\nClinton (D) \u2013 8 yrs in office. 2 criminal indictments. One conviction. One prison sentence. That\u2019s right nearly 8 yrs of investigations. Tens of millions spent and 30 yrs of claiming them the most corrupt ever and there was exactly one person convicted of a crime.\n\nBush, George H. W. (R) \u2013 4 yrs in office. One indictment. One conviction. One prison sentence.\n\nReagan (R) \u2013 8 yrs in office. 26 criminal indictments. 16 convictions. 8 prison sentences.\n\nCarter (D) \u2013 4 yrs in office. One indictment. Zero convictions and zero prison sentences.\n\nFord (R) \u2013 4 yrs in office. One indictment and one conviction. One prison sentence.\n\nNixon (R) \u2013 6 yrs in office. 76 criminal indictments. 55 convictions. 15 prison sentences.\n\nJohnson (D) \u2013 5 yrs in office. Zero indictments. Zero convictions. Zero prison sentences.\n\nSo, let\u2019s see where that leaves us. In the last 53 years, Democrats have been in the Oval Office for 25 of those years, while Republicans held it for 28. In their 25 yrs in office Democrats had a total of three executive branch officials indicted with one conviction and one prison sentence. That\u2019s one whole executive branch official convicted of a crime in two and a half decades of Democrat leadership.\n\nIn the 28 yrs that Republicans have held office over the last 53 yrs they have had a total of (a drum roll would be more than appropriate), 120 criminal indictments of executive branch officials. 89 criminal convictions and 34 prison sentences handed down. That\u2019s more prison sentences than years in office since 1968 for Republicans. If you want to count articles of impeachment as indictments (they aren\u2019t really but we can count them as an action), both sides get one more. However, Clinton wasn\u2019t found guilty while Nixon resigned and was pardoned by Ford (and a pardon carries with it a legal admission of guilt on the part of the pardoned). So those only serve to make Republicans look even worse.\n\nWith everything going on with Trump and his people right now, it\u2019s a safe bet Republicans are gonna be padding their numbers a bit real soon.\n\nSo let\u2019s just go over the numbers one more time, shall we? 120 indictments for Republicans. 89 convictions, and 34 prison sentences. Those aren\u2019t \u201cfeelings\u201d or \u201calternate facts.\u201d Those are simply the stats by the numbers. Republicans are, and have been for my entire lifetime, the most criminally corrupt party to hold the office of the presidency.\n\nSo those are the actual numbers. Feel free to copy and paste!\u201d",

Both Leave campaigns were built on lies fuelled by right-wing gutter press and possibly even Russian interference. \n\nHow is it democratic when people don\u2019t even know what they were voting for after years of calculated disinformation? How is it democratic to assume a mandate of hard Brexit when the majority don\u2019t even want that?\n\nIt was never anything to do with democracy. The referendum was called to silence Eurosceptic backbenchers. It was party politics all along and I\u2019m sick and tired of hearing this \u201cwill of the people\u201d bollocks.",
