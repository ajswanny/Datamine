The point is, even when drugs are illegal, people can still get their hands on them. Prohibition doesn't work, as has been demonstrably shown many times. Making drugs illegal just pushes them underground, creates shady organisations with manipulative/downright destructive people, and means the drug in question is even more unsafe than its legal & pure counterpart would be, not to mention people would be taking it in more dangerous locations, with more chance of causing harm to themselves & others.

    "body": "I think most people's natural reaction is to say no to legalising hard drugs which is why it'll never happen. However, look at it from a purely logical viewpoint and I believe it makes a lot more sense for them to be legal rather than illegal. I think a lot of people jump straight to the conclusion that legal drugs means there'll be a free for all with people getting smacked off their tits 24/7. The evidence from countries with liberal drug laws though suggests the exact opposite is true whilst there are a lot of benefits to legalisation.\n\nLet's be honest here, if people want heroin, they are going to get it regardless of it's legality. \n\nIf it's legal and regulated the government can control what is being sold, who is selling it, how strong it is, where it can be bought and how much tax is going to be charged on it. The tax goes towards funding treatment for drug addictions, proper drug education for the public, needle exchanges, etc. \n\nThe police should have less work as well as they now don't need to allocate as much time and funding towards going after drug dealers and can concentrate their resources on other matters.\n\nAny profits from the sale of these drugs are going to companies that are going to be paying their employees proper wages on which income tax will be charged and the company will also be paying corporation tax. So it's good for the economy as well. \n\nFurther to this, I believe studies have shown in Portugal that usage across the board decreased once drugs were decriminalised. This is perhaps due to the legal nature of the drug making them less attractive to rebellious younger people.\n\nIn contrast, illegal drugs are sold out in public by criminals for cash. You have no idea what exactly it is that you are buying or how strong the drug you have just purchased is going to be. Someone could buy heroin that is x% strength one day and y% strength the next and end up killing themselves by accidentally overdosing.\n\nThe NHS still has to deal with problems associated with the drug but has no tax income to offset this against. Same with drug education, it has to come out of the general tax pool. The cash paid for a drug goes to criminals who don't pay income tax and it's probable this income is funding further criminal activities in some form.\n\nIt's highly likely, for example, that somewhere along the line this cash is going to criminals who are involved in activities such as prostitution, trafficking, racketeering, etc. The police have to combat all this criminal activity which requires yet more funding from the tax pot.\n\nTo conclude then, legalising drugs would likely mean a better funded NHS, a better resourced police force, more help for people with drug addictions, a better educated public who are less likely to indulge in drugs, a boost to the economy with a reduction in money laundering, better control over the sale and usage of drugs, decreases in the rates of illnesses like HIV that are passed by dirty needles and would cut off a large source of income for criminals leading to a drop in criminal activity.\n\nAre we still going to have people getting hopelessly addicted to drugs like crystal meth and heroin? Yes. The big difference though is that there is a well resourced system around to help people through these addictions.",

All drugs are dangerous the more addictive and dangerous the more prohibition causes harm. If herion was decriminalised you would not suddenly find loads of people giving it a go.    The argument of drugs not being that harmful is not a good one. It's still harmful and the less harmful it is the more likely people will see it being legal as a green light that it is ok and is something that is good to try.  Take something like speeding in cars lots of people already do it but making it legal would make it worse. A lot of people allready think it's \"not that bad to go a bit over\" so as soon as it is legal even more people would give it a go. ",

I think any person who has been around cannabis smokers will know that it can fuck some people up with long term use, so most young 20 to 25 years olds will not be swayed by this. The only people it might sway are the 13 to 19 types who might be experimenting thinking it's \"cool\" not really having exposure to the bad sides (not meaning to sound condescending). Out of these only the 18 and 19 years old can vote, so what this policy is doing is attracting a very small percentage of voters at the expense of normalising a a drug that can (and most certainly will) permanenetly screw the minds of some peope.\n\nWhat ultimately made me stop smoking (and ever trying again) was an experience with some extremely potent cannabis that my mate got  hold of. I suffered from derealisation  for 2 days straight which was harrowing as I was concerned it was going to be permanent.  Again, I have mates who smoke regularly and enjoy it which I'm fine with. As I said the side effects on mental health are seriously unreported so for a policy to come out legalising it seems very irresponsible. I don't care it if sounds lame or uncool, drugs are not cool and mental health problems are terrible. Why risk fucking up your permanent cognition and perception of life. \n\nA bit of a story. My girlfriend sectioned an early 30s man this year who had been a cannabis smoker and had also smoked spice. He was suffering from severe psychosis and had to be sedated after sectioning to stop him from hurting himself. They woke him up every other day for approximately 3 weeks to see if there was any improvement which there was none (continued spitting, lashing out, could only say the word \"no\", tearing at his skin). He ended up dying due to constant sedation; basically his heart gave up. Wish I could say I was bullshitting but it's a reality for some. ",

Many young people say it's easier to get weed than beer, because its illegality means there's a demand for dealers who don't ask for ID. It's often described as being a gateway drug, but ironically it's currently a gateway to other illegal drugs! Just the other day someone on here was talking about his dealer offering him MDMA - a drug he'd otherwise had no interest in. And then there's education - in a legal framework we can educate realistically about the pros and cons, like we do with alcohol. But since it's illegal, the main education is, DONT DO IT DRUGS R BAD THEYLL MESS YOU UP... which is of course often a perfect incentive to do it.\n\nI think the 'think of the kids' line is what prohobitionists use to scare people off the idea without looking into it more sensibly.",

His message still lacked nuance. \n\nPoint being, I already smoked weed but was terrified of anything harder. When I got to uni I was introduced to pills and coke and felt like the veil had been lifted. All these things I thought would Kill me / ruin my life after one try  seemed fairly tame in reality. I'm just glad I wasn't naive enough to try heroin then. ",

Thier is a big difference in someone may use one item of many choices to causes harm vs an item being the direct cause of harm for some people. \n\nI agree this does affect your personal freedom but lots of laws affect personal freedom. The question is does the reduction in personal freedom cause a a good enough gain to society to be worth it.   Also please don't make the mistake of saying it affects no one else as this is bullshit. The cost of looking after drug addicts is not cheap. The loss of a usefull member of society is a possible cost. Finally thier is the damage it can cause to a family and friends.  However why protect people that end up in this situation as you want personal freedom.  Why not scrap laws that say speeding is illegal it stops your personal freedom to drive fast. The worst one is that law that affects my personal freedom to drive on the pavement.  Ok this may be a little bit straw man but less so than your golf club or all recreational activities argument. The harm any activity may cause must be assessed indervidually and if the risk of harm to one's self is high and the risk of others being affected is moderate I would rather my government took some steps to protect me. \n\nIf the current drug laws worked no one would be on drugs and making something illegal can cause its own harms.  Given this I am not saying legalising it with increased education and help for children and parents affected by drug addiction would not be a valid option. However the reason should not be I have used it and was fine so it's safe or what about my personal freedom.  These arguments could be applied to so much that would make the world a worst place.   ",

It was a policy I personally didn't like, though i feel It does generally feed into the anti-tradition/nationalism image they present.\n\nThe House of Lords policy doesn't play into the anti-nationalism image because a. they never talk about it and b. a super majority of the British nation agree with it. And opposition to the House of Lorsa is definitely picking up among Leave voters given how pro-Remain it is (as well as being London based and filled with old political cronies). \n\nThe Lib Dems also rarely talk about Trident renewal now. The only time I remember them making it into a big point of contention was the 2010 election where they got their highest share of the vote in decades. Really doubt that's what damaging them now, especially given how they still support a nuclear deterrent and never talk about abolishing it. I'd be shocked if most of the public actually knew what their policy was (same for the House of Lords).\n\nSo the real problem with the Lib Dems is their support for immigration, refugees and the EU. It's toxic among Leave voters but young Remain voters are perfectly fine with voting for a party like this. It's been the Lib Dem strategy to pick up these voters after Labour's troubles and Corbyn's Brexit policy (which is almost identical to the Tories). It's not successful for a lot of reasons but if I were trying to rebuild the Lib Dems it'd be the route I'd take.\n\n>The proponents of identity politics are mainly upper middle class white men? Who would have thought!\n\nUntil this Parliament the Lib Dems have made no attempt to recuit non-white and women as MPs. Compare this to Cameron's A-list when he became leader over 10 years ago and ask yourself if the Lib Dems are really all about \"identity politics\". They're by far the most anti-positive discrimination party of the main 3.\n\n>Because those parties are perceived as competent and patriotic, which in most countries is the main thing that counts. Most people are/were for drugs decriminalisation despite voting Blair/Conservative. Northern Ireland is hugely pro-abortion & gay marriage (as was the mainland when it was still an issue) despite voting in the DUP.\nMaybe it's just me but i feel there are a lot of progressive minded that would just feel totally out of place in the modern Labour/Lib/Green parties.\n\nMy point that the British public doesn't care about small government comes from support for renationalisation, higher public spending (so long as other people are taxed to pay for it), the violation of our civil liberties, tough attitudes towards crime and a strong anti-immigrant streak.

    "body": "How about football? That causes violence. From people getting too compettitive or the English's famous inability to not riot afterward. Thats more applicable than golf clubs, frankly because I've never seen golf hooligans. People get addicted to the sport, get violent and cause lasting harm because of football. But thats just people being irresponsible, and I can chalk people smoking a blunt, driving at 5mph and being paranoid and chilled out every alternate 3 seconds to irresponsible usage. But they have control over all of that, and people are capable of knocking it on the head before it's a problem. It's easy to knock it on the head while it is a problem. For every argument against cannabis, guns and the likes I apply it to something legal like alcohol or some form of sport and come to the conclusion of banning it. Because the argument is that some people might be irresponsible. \n\nAll of this is different from a chemical dependancy and something that is guarenteed to be harmful. Herion as you brought up shouldn't be legal because bad effects there aren't down to irresponsible habits and down to an actual, physical dependancy with all the illness and harm that comes with getting off the drug. We ban speeding because a car crash is inevitable and guarenteed. But for some reason we have weapons laws, restrictions on non addictive substances and other miscellanious crap because of a minority of people getting into trouble with them which is what I'm against.\n\nBut I do value my and other peoples freedom more than I value my safety and security or the safety and security of others. There has to be a better reason to ban something than \"A minority of people are harmed by it\"",
