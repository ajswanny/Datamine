It basically shows what I tried to explain below.\n\nThere's a slight distinction: The deaths during the Troubles included just over a thousand members of the British security forces(military, police, RUC, etc), while civilian deaths were around 1900. The remaining 500 or so were from the paramilitary groups.\n\nMost counts put IRA victims at ~1800, meaning they were responsible for about 800 civilian deaths along with the 1k British forces. \n\nThe remaining 1100 civilian deaths were the victims of the Loyalist groups(reprisals for IRA actions) and the British Army(incidents like Bloody Sunday, falsely identified IRA members, and the other murky incidents).\n\nSo while the IRA saw themselves fighting a war, and most definitely were responsible for an indefensible number of civilian deaths, the Loyalists were for the most part vigilantes who targeted Catholic civilians regardless of their status.

People were talking about Labour being \"hijacked by far left activists\" but it seems like it's the Tory party that's been hijacked by its own far right within its organisation and also the increasingly \"homeless/partyless\" UKIP and BNP voters.\n\nLike u/StrongAndStable said - it's another one of those things that Labour was accused of going through, yet it appears to be the Tories who actually have the issue.\n\nHaving said that, I think their PR machine and the media barons will help rehabilitate their image amongst the baby boomers even if they are now a party that's prepared to get into bed with the DUP and all that baggage that I don't need to repeat.

The IRA's intention was to assassinate the loyalist Ulster Defense Association leadership, who were to be meeting in a room above Frizzell's fish shop on Shankill Road, Belfast. Two IRA members were to enter the shop disguised as deliverymen, then force the customers out at gunpoint and plant a time bomb with a short fuse. However, when the IRA members entered the shop with the bomb, it exploded prematurely. One of the IRA members was killed along with a UDA member and eight Protestant civilians.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.2",
