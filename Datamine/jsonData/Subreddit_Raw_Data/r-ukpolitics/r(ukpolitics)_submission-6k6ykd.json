I'm all for capitalism but it needs to be regulated so that a few people can't hold sway over the many. \n\nAnd when we are told that there's no magic money tree, I think back to 2009 when the banks were bailed out following the financial crash to the sum of around \u00a3450bn. Money that was supposed to be used to stimulate growth through lending but surprise surprise, it wasn't and instead wages went up 12% and bonuses were continued under the excuse that bankers would leave our shore. \nBut when Corbyn suggests using \u00a3250bn as a stimulus to drive innovation, infrastructure, and industry, he's called a commie and told he'll bankrupt us all and we'll be like Venezuela. \n\nHere we are in 2017, \u00a31bn of our money given to NI as a way to secure power. And now once again the tories are withholding pay raises... not only that, but in the wake of 4 terror attacks and Grenfell tower after tories themselves tweeted to end the pay cap! \n\nThey are cretins. The lot of them. It's disgusting because it's all about lining their own pockets. Just google tories and private healthcare and see which of them have fingers in the private industry pie. \n\nFuck holes.",

    "body": "I'm actually wondering if Mayism (for want of a better term but I think it's an ideology that's been growing in the background  long before May rose through the rank) is even more anti-social than Thatcherism.\n\nFor all its cruelty Thatcherism hoped to achieve benefits for society. It may not have been the right tool for the job but it had a clear aim of ending the \"sick man Brittain\"  of the 1970s, to get the economy working again, it hoped that with radical economic reforms that wealth would spread to everyone (trickle down). It was brutal, it was flawed, at times it was regressive, but it was, I think, a genuine attempt to make the UK better.\n\nThe current generation of Tory leaders though don't seem to be trying to fix anything. The UK economy is actually pretty strong, the only real weakness (that isn't Brexit related) is productivity but no government in the last 15 years has tried to address that issue. Other major economies managed to deal with the financial crisis without resorting to austerity and ours was certainly strong enough to done so. All this government seems to care about is social entrenchment, social mobility is going down and seems to be the deliberate consequence of policy rather than accident. Policies keep highly skilled, highly dedicated public sector workers (nurses, teachers, police & firefighters) in near poverty while the government looks to ideas like bringing back fox hunting or grammar schools as a way to move Britain forward.\n\nThatcher at least tried to create a right wing version of a classless society, May and others want the opposite, they want to re-entrench the ruling class.",

Food banks do not log the details on the people who use their services, nor should they. The real scandal as far as I'm concerned is that [under this Tory government the number of food banks in this country is growing, not shrinking](https://fullfact.org/economy/how-many-people-use-food-banks/). That's something backed up by actual evidence. It's a total disgrace and the government should be utterly ashamed of themselves for allowing there to be a necessity for a single food bank, let alone a growing number of them.",

If you use wording or procedure wrongly or over-achieving, that legislation may be used for harming other people or destroying their basic human rights. Hence wording here is terribly important. If it is overintrusive or discriminatory, it should be challenged. I really don't know which legislation you mention and don't know Corbyn's stand towards it (which phrases he countered, etc.) but a legislation's wording and even its intent is massively imporant as it literally can be abused in some cases.\n\nOn the other hand, I believe Queen's Speech includes quite a number of economical, fiscal meaures. And I just checked 2016 speech, where Queen spoke about competitive economy, economic recovery. I'll give you one point, they might not agreed with the wording, or let's say over-political standpoint of their amendment, but I'm pretty sure, if they wanted, they could've find a common ground. Or not.\n\nHowever there is a massive difference between wording of an anti-terror legislation and including a part in Queen's speech about nurses getting paid. Hence first about principles, i.e. human rights, second one could be connected to callousness, i.e. well, we have no magic money tree unless you can make us the government.\n\nAnd I do think this is a political manouvre by Labour Party to further their support, but still.",

Some of the most compassionate intellectuals out there believe being pro-private sector is best for everyone.

Fortunately during the election we stopped seeing both parties with the Paul Dacre filter, May was exposed and Corbyn was shown to be something far more than some socialist throw-back to the 70s.

Legally speaking, no the queens speech doesn't need to be unamended. However Legally speaking the queens speech doesn't need to pass at all (May is still leader), The queen could disband parliament and make me leader, and you can shoot a Welshman after midnight with a crossbow in the city of Chester.\n\nIn reality convention is the thing that makes our political system work, and without it the entire thing kind of breaks down. We have a house of lords that mostly works not because of their limits of power, but because they choose to stick to convention. Breaking one would give others the option to break others. The entire legal system are three pieces all haphazardly placed on top of each other.\n\nIn reality the queens speech is a vote for governmental confidence, and getting it passed without amendment is the first \"water marker\" in order to say 'Yes this government is with it enough to lead people'.\n\nRemember this isn't a law being passed. The queens speech does nothing. It's basically a itinerary of all the thing the government wants to discuss over the next two years. If they can't do that without interruptions, how can they do anything else.",

We waste hundreds of thousands keeping patients on intensive care units becuase there is not capacity on high dependancy ward's due to staff. \nPatients are staying in hospital for weeks longer than they should because the community care team havnt got enough staff to look after then effectively in their homes. Theatre lists going unused forcing linger hospital stays and climbing waiting lists becuase there is not enough staff to cover them. \n\nYes there are a lot of ineffiencies due to purchasing and ridiculous vanity projects by managers but I bet they pale in comparison to those that could be fixed by staffing levels.

It does not work, it's been proven not to work, and so not many places do it. You need to invest to stimulate growth.  Sometimes that means borrowing a little, which is why you have to trust that sound investments are being made, because it's only worth it if you get a return on that investment.

I don't believe actual voting would have gone a different way either. Tories were actively cheering the defeat in the Commons, even if it was just because they beat their opponent it looks really bad for them. Which leaves a very sour taste in the public's mouth. They just blocked a pay cap scrap (I will get on to the symbolic nature of it in a sec) to the people who helped us get through probably the most troubling times in the UK for a while, symbolic or not, and they did it by using the 10 mp's they paid \u00a31bn to. All after the endless \"no magic money tree\" narrative. It wasn't a power play, everyone knows they have the majority it's been a pretty public affair on how they obtained it. Flaunting a widely criticised move to block something like the pay cap scrap gains them absolutely nothing. The only other logical reason to block it is because they know they don't plan to uphold it when it came to a real vote. \n\nIt's not just a symbolic gesture. It sets a precedent, had they agreed people would expect them to do it. It's on the same level as a campaign policy. No legal requirement for you to uphold it but the public expect you to uphold it. Also as much as the queen doesn't really have power, many in the country are still loyal to the royalty and would still consider it a huge insult to the queen to break that agreement (look at the uproar over people thinking Corbyn insulted the queen by not bowing for instance).\n\nCorbyn is putting pressure on them in the most public way possible to get something changed that shouldn't have happened in the first place (and lets not blame that purely on the Tories, Labour backed the cap). Nothing particularly dishonest about it. Yes it's an easy move for him, it's a win win. They block it he proves a point about them not caring about the public. They agree he gets what he actually wants. There being not much risk for Corbyn doesn't make it a dishonest move though. \n\nI'm not saying Corbyn is perfect either, he killed his own reputation as a truly honest politician with the train stunt. He plays the game like any other, the main difference for me is he generally plays it in our favour.\n\nOverall it shows a key problem with our system. All parties involved are more interested in undermining their opponents rather than what is good for the people they represent. They will vote against each others policies purely out of spite. Rather than work together to do something good or find a compromise. The commons is like watching kids in a playground insult each other.",

For those of us that are more casually just subbed, the posts that make it to our screens are the very left leaning ones.\n\nA lot of people would regard the failure of the implementation of a socialist experiment to be a great success as of late. I think you are still biased even now. The one great negative for the Conservatives as of late has been the more even election result. To be honest, even if I was a die hard Tory I'd be grateful that we have elections being called, and that people have a chance to be represented. It has resulted in changes to government that we can see in the Queens speech.\n\nI'm not sure how things like Grenfell, terrorist attacks and a fundamentally different approach to taxation and spending constitutes \"very few positives\". I see how granting money here and there would seem like instant positive changes, but a lot of people believe this to not be realistic. There is a line between what is achievable and what makes a nice sounding thing to post on Reddit or Facebook. I believe that both parties are too far on either side of that line at the moment.\n\nIf the party that is an 'omnishambles' managed to secure as man votes as it did, then that doesn't speak brilliantly for the other parties does it? People seem to completely lose all context when discussing things like the election. It is \"labour won the election\" madness manifest.\n\nI suspect this comment to be downvoted, when all I'm trying to do is advocate for level headed discussion and less of the #nastyparty stuff that I genuinely think people with an active interest in politics ought be above. Things like that are nothing more than virtue signalling, wild personal opinions and arrogance. If people could just attempt to rationalise decisions made by people they disagree with, then we'd all be in a much better state.\n\n>It's no surprise that the biggest threads are left when Tory approval is so low.\n\nIs the same true for the Trump subs, considering his approval rating?",
