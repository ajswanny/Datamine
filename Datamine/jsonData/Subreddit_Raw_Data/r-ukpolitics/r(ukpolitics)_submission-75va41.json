I believe the project linked below was one of the largest however it was still a trial and has now been removed (as intended!) but it was only 1.2MW.\n\nI think one of the main issues is cost however I think tidal barrages where you do something across the mouth of an estuary are potentially lower cost. These have other issues though as they can have significant impacts on wildlife and shipping.\n\nThere's a tidal lagoon planned in south wales which would be very large scale and would take tidal power into the mainstream if it worked. I think the issue there is very large upfront capital cost and untried technology. I can't figure out if that's going to be a success, it looks good on paper but the company doing it seem a bit dodgy.\n\nWith all of that in mind you are correct in that we're an island and also have a large tidal range so are well placed to exploit it as a resource.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SeaGen\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidal_Lagoon_Swansea_Bay",

    "body": "Woodchip waste being burnt for energy instead of rotting in a landfill, yes.  Here is a blurb about Drax coal power station moving in part to biomass:\n\nExplainer: Biomass fuel\n\nThe wood pellets used as biomass fuel at Drax are made from low-grade wood such as forest thinnings, tree tops and branches, as well as residue from sawmills and agricultural waste such as straw and seed husks.\n\nThe biomass is dried and compressed into pellets the size of peanut shells for easier and more economical transport. They have a lower \u201cenergy density\u201d than coal which means that about twice the volume of biomass is needed to produce roughly the same amount of heat and electricity.\n\nThis basic rule of physics, combined with the fact that the biomass pellets have to be stored dry in huge domes rather than spread out in the open air, means that Drax has moved from having more than 70 days of fuel stocks when it was a completely coal-fired power station, to having about 13 days of biomass stocks.\n\n\u201cWe have never worked on that timescale before. We weren\u2019t geared up for \u2018just in time\u2019 delivery,\u201d said Jason Shipstone, the engineer responsible for the design, construction and commissioning of the new biomass facilities at Drax.\n\nIt meant that Drax had to improve its lines of biomass supply from North America so that there was a continuous and regular delivery of the purpose-made wood pellets. They had to be compressed and dried before shipping across the Atlantic to the port of Immingham on the River Humber, where they are transported to Drax by a specially designed fleet of trains.\n\nWood is also 100 times easier to ignite than coal, which posed a new kind of explosive fire risk. The pellets are so dry they give off a fine dust which can easily ignite, Mr Shipstone said.\n\n\u201cWe had to think of the dust coming off this stuff as gunpowder. So we had to think of the fuel as containing 8 per cent gunpowder,\u201d he said.\n\nhttp://www.independent.co.uk/environment/green-energy-how-one-power-plant-chips-away-at-the-uks-carbon-footprint-a6796716.html",

Nuclear fuel is amazingly cheap - the old dream of energy 'too cheap to meter' was based on that. Nuclear power plants and the staff to run them and to clean up afterwards - those are _incredibly_ expensive.\n\nSo the economics of nuclear power turn out to be quite simple. Having spent enormous amounts of money on the plant, it _never_ makes sense to leave it idle to save on fuel. It's always better business to keep it going pretty much full throttle and sell the output for absolutely any price you can get. Even if it's laughably cheap, it's still more than the cost of the fuel.\n\nNow in France they rely heavily on nuclear, which produces exactly the same every day no matter what. Usually that means a big surplus, because the French made sure to build in a safety margin. \n\nIn Britain, on the other hand, we use a lot of gas power - have done ever since the North Sea supply came in. Now gas plants are the opposite of nuclear: the plant is quite cheap to build and to run, and fuel is a big part of the cost, so you throttle them up and down according to supply and demand in order to get the best price. Burn lots of gas when prices - and so profits - are high, but shut down when prices fall.\n\nHere's the purpose of those interconnector cables, then. If demand is low, then France has a huge energy surplus that they are desperate to sell at any price. British firms buy it up cheaply and use it to supply British demand; and faced with this flood of cheap imported energy, British gas plants throttle back, saving on fuel costs until demand increases.\n\nThis morning must have been a high demand time. If France can't supply everything from all that nuclear power, then they must buy energy at any price or else see the lights go out. Britain might therefore run the gas turbines that little bit harder to cover the shortfall and earn a tidy profit.",

But it's essentially 'burnt' up immediately. If you turn the reactor off, xenon is still being produced (because of radioactivity), but not being burnt off. So it gets to a point, after a few hours, where you can't feasibly turn the reactor on again.\n\nAfter that, you wait for the xenon to decay. This takes on the order of weeks, before you can turn on the reactor again.\n\ntl;dr, a reactor can't be off for a day and just turn back on.

We need a strong baseline, non-intermittent power source, so wind can only go so high. Nuclear is good, but not the sort of thing you switch on and off with the seasons, and there are all sorts of hurdles to building new nuclear capacity.\n\nThough with expanding storage technology and more electricity exchange with the continent we can start to rely more on wind and less on gas in the long term. I just think we shouldn't have an urgent war on gas in the same way we've had a war on coal. The emissions reduction opportunities aren't as high compared with other areas we could make big changes.\n\nThe big bugbear right now is the transport sector.

If they expect electricity prices to be higher in future, bidding low isn't a problem.\n\nThe UK strike price is the price the developers receive, whatever the electricity price.\n\n> Also you'll notice that when the solar results came out most serious market commentators knew that it was unrealistic\n\nThe solar prices were for developments that were supposed to start immediately. These offshore wind projects aren't due to begin construction for several years, so the prices are much more speculative.\n\n>Offshore wind developments are huge and players are much larger and serious than some of the solar developers - there's a much higher barrier to entry\n\nYes, I agree. But there is very little barrier to exit. If it turns out costs haven't fallen far enough, there is nothing to stop these developers simply walking away. ",

Almost all the increase in demand will come from electrification of heat and transport.

Solar drops to zero every day (and is guaranteed to be producing no electricity at times of peak demand in the UK). Wind frequently drops very close to zero.\n\nSo far this year wind power has varied between about 9 GW and 0.2 GW. If we built 10 times as much wind power, we'd have between 90 and 2 GW. UK demand varies (roughly) between 50 and 20 GW.\n\nBecause wind is so unreliable (and solar produces nothing at peak demand) we need 100% backup for any wind power we add to the grid. That means higher emissions and higher costs. \n\nA completely renewable grid isn't possible without major breakthroughs in technology. \n\n>Many people argue that we should ignore renewables in favour of nuclear which makes no sense to me at all.\n\nNuclear is much more reliable. That means we can replace existing gas and coal plants with nuclear, cutting emissions and cutting costs. According to the ERP wind will reduce UK emissions to 180 grams of CO2 per KWH. Nuclear will reduce emissions to 50 grams. \n\nThe only countries in Europe that already meet the targets the UK has set use either conventional dammed hydro, nuclear, or both, to produce the vast bulk of their electricity. In the UK we don't have suitable locations for a large expansion of hydro, so the only way we can meet targets is with nuclear.",
