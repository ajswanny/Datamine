This was a *judicial review* action- public authorities are held to procedural standards which they must follow. The key word in the judgment is *consider*- the courts don't actually concern themselves (as the law stands now) with the merits of a decision, merely that the public authority did its due diligence in making it. In order to rectify this, the Government merely has to consider it, and then go 'yep! We've considered it. We still haven't changed our mind', and then the courts will have nothing to say about it. This is a heavily simplified version, of course, but it's broadly accurate.",

More details:\n\n>The ruling is a partial victory for the families \u2013 originally from Iraq, Sudan, Ethiopia and Syria \u2013 who left the coast of Lebanon in a fishing boat operated by smugglers in the hope of making an Italian landfall. After a few days at sea in October 1998, however, the engine failed and the smugglers abandoned the vessel. The refugees managed to steer the boat towards the nearest visible land \u2013 beaching close to the RAF\u2019s Akrotiri military airfield.\n\n>The six families, some of whom have had children while living in the territory of the UK military bases, were assessed as being entitled to refugee status. Although the government disputed that the 1951 refugee convention applied, it agreed to act within its spirit.\n\n>The families were provided with support and given accommodation previously used by British soliders. The UK government subsequently encouraged them to move out of the bases and into the neighbouring republic of Cyprus. The families declined to move, because they were worried about losing their refugee status  ",

You can read the [full judgment here](http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2017/397.html) if interested.\n\nVery roughly, the case was about whether the UN Refugee Convention applies to the UK military base areas on Cyprus because they weren't really part of the UK. The UK Government had asserted that it didn't so they had no obligations under the Convention to let the refugees into the UK.\n\nThe Court of Appeal ruled that they were wrong - that the Convention did apply to the Sovereign Base Areas, so the Government has to decide again whether to let the refugees come to the UK.\n\nIf the Government decides not to let them in, they can *still challenge that decision* - because the Government has to act reasonably/rationally etc. - meaning a Court could order them to let the refugees in. So while *in theory* judicial reviews are only about the process, not the outcome, in practice they are about the outcome.",

The Government could still comfortably refuse entry, citing any number of reasons as to why.

It's not about 75 people, it's about the millions that would follow suit if the government rolled over. The only mistake the government has made is in not sidestepping the farce by ripping up the refugee convention entirely.

Let me explain how it works (system brought in under Labour by the way).\n\nIf a company wants to employ a foreign worker, they can't just do that, its more complex than that. Firstly, the company must prove that they can't find a British worker and they must be offering at least a set amount determined by the home office, for instance a sales and marketing director will get at least \u00a350k a year. If they can prove that they could not get a British worker, then they can apply for a foreign one if they match the criteria and offer them the same wage. Companies can only sponsor certain jobs (there is a list), they can't sponsor for certain jobs, like builder, cleaner, etc. The company gets constant inspections by the home office to make sure they are abiding with employment laws and regulations.\n\nSo how exactly are companies exploiting foreign workers? They must pay a wage that a Brit would get, work the same hours, etc. Employing illegal workers is a criminal offence by the company and the worker, subjecting the company to huge fines, so legitimate companies don't do that as the consequences far outweigh the benefits.\n\nConservatives have kept the sponsorship applications to 10,000 a year, and usually don't get that many a year. People get in other ways, albeit arranged marriage, asylum, illegally or legal EU workers (this the government is powerless at the moment to control). So your crap propaganda about not sticking to targets is highly distorted. \n\nNow you have been furnished with a bit of knowledge by someone who really understands this and is immersed in this day in, day out, shut the fuck up with your bullshit lies and fake propaganda. \n\nCorbyn wants to scrap the 10,000 limit and the company sponsorship, and just immigrants promise they are going to get a job if they come to the UK.  This will cause mass open door immigration, causing a huge strain on schools, NHS and other services. It will also flood the job market with cheap workers as the current regulations of checking will be dropped.",

    "body": "There is nothing the government can do about EU workers, that is currently governed by EU law until Brexit. As I said, Corbyn is talking about non EU citizens.\n\nJust to put something in perspective about the care Home workers from Poland, what they had was good in their eyes. My  partner is from the former Eastern Block so many of her friends came over, etc. There a person earns in a year what we get in a month. To get a job in the UK where you are housed, fed and paid more than in your homeland (even after deductions) is amazing, as most come over to earn some money to take back home. It only seems really unfair for us as our cost of living is far higher than theirs. Don't forget a pint in Poland is under a \u00a31.  I just paid \u00a32.20 for a Mr. Softy ice cream in the UK, when I was last in Poland, a good quality ice cream cone with Ben and Jerry's quality ice cream (far nicer and better quality than the UK one) cost me 20p from a shop in a major high street! If you make it harder or more expensive for the employer to employ EU nationals after Brexit, they just won't employ them.\n\nAlso remember, it goes the other way with Brits abroad, especially on gap years or summer holidays abroad. Working at a resort abroad where your accommodation and food is paid for, the pay is abysmal (believe me, I did it).\n\nPeople work for different reasons, we work in the UK to build a life, the temporary EU workers to send money home and Brits in resorts to get laid.",
