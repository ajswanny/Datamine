The Bendy Banana rules are actually the rules of the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations. Leaving the EU doesn't mean getting any more control over them, as every country that engages in world trade has to abide by the rules. All it means is that you have to go through the process of compliance all by yourself. In that respect, the Great Repeal Bill will simply replace the European Communities Act in having trading bloc rules implemented automatically in British law.",

    "body": "From a power perspective Scotland has little power within the UK today. That's not a 'those horrible Yoon Tories' comment. It's a reality of the FPTP voting system, as the SNP are so dominant in the bulk of constituencies that there is nothing to be gained in a UK party (e.g. the Tories) trying to appeal to voters here. Indeed, for the Tories there's actually a bonus to Scotland being disenfranchised (and thus likely to vote SNP), as that then means they have a better time winning seats in England. If the Tories were actually nice to Scotland they could pick up a few seats in the more traditionally conservative parts but this wouldn't make any real difference to how they would govern at a UK level. Everything that (successful) UK political parties do can be explained in terms of the effect that it has upon general election results due to FPTP. Appealing to voters in Scotland is as irrelevant as appealing to voters in Camden or university towns, or to Tory safe seats. The entire Tory policy platform is geared for towns like Nuneaton and the more marginal Labour seats like Copeland.\n\nIf we had a better UK electoral system like STV or AMS, then this wouldn't be the case. Then it doesn't matter where votes are as much, as additional votes anywhere will have an effect in increasing the amount of power they have in Parliament. The SNP can't do a Labour and ignore parts of Scotland now because they can and will lose seats as a result.",

It's hard enough as it is with vehicles, where people are actively aware of how much money they're spending on fuel and so will take that into account when purchasing. In the US the traditional automakers are already pushing back on the new Obama administration EPA fuel efficiency rules, because they know that they can make more money in the short term by producing cheaper but less efficient cars than they could by making them more efficient. For household appliances like vacuum cleaners the energy use is just an unattributable portion of your electricity bill, so there's not a lot of consumer awareness about the problem of energy efficiency. The EU-mandated energy efficiency fiches (those A/B/C/D/E/F rating things you get with electrical) are one step to combating this, but the next step is to actively force manufacturers to produce better products. As with cars, the issue is that a more efficient product will have a higher upfront cost, and in a competitive market unless all manufacturers are forced to do something, the ones which choose to remain inefficient and cheap will have an advantage over those which do invest in better technologies. That investment can therefore only realistically happen as a result of market regulation. It's like how Tesla has only been able to come about because of restrictions on internal combustion vehicles - now that the investment has happened, the battery electric vehicle technology has improved to the extent that it will no longer need government intervention to take over the rest of the market by virtue of being fundamentally superior to internal combustion.",
