My parents had been buying it since its launch in the 80s, and i remember it being on the kitchen table every morning. This continued up until the end of the print version. Always enjoyed it, especially the international perspective it gave. You also received a wide amount political views. Although it's always been centre left leaning, it gave a platform to individuals like Nigel Farage at times.\n\nSo what happened? There was a change in ownership which changed the  direction of the online service. The Independent is determined to keep its online portion completely free and it can only do that through driving traffic. This has lead to clickbaity headlines. Although these headlines can often be poor quality (especially those that get to places like reddit and facebook, where such titles are very effective), the actual article content is not much different to other news sites.\n\nI currently consume the paid variant of the Independent. This essentially gives you access to an App which seeks to recreate the old print version. Included in this are pieces similar to the articles available online, but often without the clickbait and with other more professional content in the form of editorials ect. It also provides access to the Independents \"magazine\" pieces which were among my favourite parts of the original print version (and the best researched/written).\n\nIt's depressing that the clickbait stuff has become such an issue on Reddit, because it means i'm very cautious to share what i consider to be top rate examples of journalism from the Independent. I currently save anything that i find to be particularly informative/interesting/high quality and would be more than happy to share if anyone is interested. These aren't \"once in a blue moon\" decent articles, i normally save at least once story from each edition.\n\nI would urge this subreddit to not immediately dismiss the entire Independent franchise because of the online clickbait shared here. I often see pieces from the daily mail, express, metro shared here, all of which have far worse journalistic standards than the content of most Independent articles. It appears we don't need to have the same conversation about those websites.",

Does anyone know of a media outlet that is... well... actually a professional news source? I'm typically left-leaning here in the UK, but here is what annoys me: \n\n- Articles that contain percentage stats on their own. (What is the point showing me 80% of X believe this, when in reality the sample size was probably around 60 and the statistic is totally irrelevant) \n- Articles which only give one statistic. (\"X number of MP's voted against a policy, SCUM!\" Ok, cool story, you gave me a statistic, now give me the opposing statistic otherwise you're smearing the context entirely!) \n- Articles which give the authors opinion on something political. (If you want to give your opinion and you are not an expert in the field, I really don't care for your opinion, as rude as that sounds. I want to hear from experts who have spent their lives dedicated to the subject being discussed. I don't want to hear \"This is a terrible move by the tories/labour party...\") \n\nSadly we live in a digital era where things like this happen: \n\n- Clickbait titles are more important than the content itself. \n- Statistics in the content have to back up the articles bias, don't include counter statistics. \n- Don't include the full stories context if it goes against the article bias. \n- Don't run anything that goes against the outlets bias. \n- Slam the user with ads and complain they need donations/subs to keep going.\n- Run something controversial/borderline offensive purely to provoke a response even when it is entirely false. \n\nHere's an idea! Make engaging unbiased content and maybe, just MAYBE, you might start to shine from the crowd and increase your engagement. \n\nMedia, huh? \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af.",

I bet they are extremely low. \n\nIt's extremely concerning that the public are consuming news in such a short form that's heavily edited and manipulated by social media managers who are simply looking for a reaction vs. educating and informing the public like an actual journalist.\n\nWe can see where this trend has landed us. The social engineering that went on behind the scenes with recent elections in the west takes inspiration from the fact that people are happy to digest a headline rather than read and understand an actual story.

Independent, WaPo. They all have want money and they all have social media departments spamming reddit.\n\n\nA few years ago, they were spamming so much that worldnews, news and other news subreddits only allowed archived news articles. This way, these propagandists wouldn't get any traffic, clicks, views, get.\n\n\nThen the admins stepped in and something happened and now these subs are pretty much paid platforms to peddle independent, guardian, etc trash. If you haven't noticed, the mods of worldnews, news, etc suddenly adopted the news industry's \"commenting guidelines\". 5 years ago, the mods of these subs were PROUD of the fact that they didn't censor comments like the news websites. It's why reddit and these subs in particular grew.\n\n\nAlso, some of these mods are employees of these media organizations too. FYI. And funnily enough, many of these guys also mod politics, enoughtrumpspam,etc. So if you see a lot of independent, guardian, thehill, etc trash on politics, etc, you know why.\n\n\nThe rat reddit admins have sold out redditors who built reddit in favor of the corporate elite and their interests.\n\n\nEdit: Look  where the rats from independent are living... in politics... \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/6l6xoz/this_independence_day_im_calling_on_my_fellow/",

I realized this once again when, since a couple days ago when google news was updated, I mistakenly get sent to the US version every time and have to change it back manually each time.\n\nWhat are these headlines there even?? What does this even have to do with news. Every headline either makes sure to fabricate a fake question, bash one side of politics or over-sensationalize everything. And hint to the writers: It's not a headline if there is full stops in it. \"Chris Christie flew close to the sun. Now, he sits under it, defiantly.\" ?? Are you trying to write prose?\n\nI'm so fcking thankful for every quality news site. Where you actually get real news and informed background information, and where you don't notice which political side they are leaning because they are not leaning anywhere at all. They are not a political tool and won't tell people what they want to hear just for the clicks, but instead do exactly what they are supposed to do: Telling you the facts about what happened.",

    "body": "> What is it with newspapers/news sites these days being generally shit and annoying?\n\nRunning a newspaper is expensive. People want the content for free - and if they can't get it for free, they'll usually go elsewhere and get something free where they can.  \n\nSo, what can a newspaper do?  \n\n1) Beg its regular readers to become subscribers  \n2) Try to generate huge audiences at low cost through clickbait trash and then use ad revenue to generate profits  \n3) Some combination of the above   \n\nThat's it. They used to subsidise the news content with the \"rivers of gold\" that came from the classified ads, but all that business went to eBay and craigslist. If you want quality journalism to continue to exist, pick a publication you believe in and buy an annual subscription. Otherwise, watch the whole thing continue to circle the drain.  ",

They want you to read again, or at least choose their paper next time you need one.\n\nTherefore, you need to be hooked by the content. In a traditional print setting, web content is sourced from the printed product and repurposed. Thus, although the headlines may be catchy or click bait, their web content will be generally well written, researched and foremost not just a load of bullshit. You can't just edit 40,000 copies of a newspaper if someone notices a misstruth. You can simply change a website. \n\nThis trend is changing - publishers are moving to produce digital content that is then utilised in print. However, in traditional newspapers and printing houses the content is still going to be printed so must be held to a higher standard and scrutiny.\n\nThe independent, being a web only publication now, doesn't need to concern itself with such rigorous scrutiny and hold it's content to such high authority. It need only do that for articles that will be used in the I - their sister publication. \n\nThe I only ever published content that had appeared in the independent - usually only a handful of it. This has allowed them to still produce quality journalism (albeit much less now), significantly reduce production costs, employ more (younger and cheaper) journalists to produce digital only content and actually generate some money in a world where traditional news sources rely on outdated news devices (print) to generate the majority of their income (advertising) to fund their news gathering to give it away essentially for free (web) with a much lower return per article (web ads).\n\nIt has always been easy to steal content on the internet and post it as your own. This happens with software, music and also news. It's so easy now to just copy news articles (you can literally do it with one hand in half a second) and change a few words then post it - it's value is significantly decreased since print is no longer the main source. \n\nThus newspapers make much less and therefore can no longer fund quality print journalism. So they have to close and produce cheap, stolen or badly researched web content with smaller teams. The content means much less now, all they need you to do is open the page so they can get a small amount towards the cost of writing real articles, which you are now getting much less of.\n\nIt's fucked up and something needs to change in the way we generate legitimate news content soon or every reputable news site will either turn into this or stay producing content that the people paying for it want it to produced. Generating real news is sadly not going to be profitable in the near future.\n\nSource: am consultant for newspapers",

The whole article is just back of the napkin math based on not very meaningfull numbers...I mean this is just as bad as claiming I spend 30% of the last year jogging because I jog two times per week.\n\nYou can write a good article about Trump wasting time golfing and people have done that but this is most definetly not one of those articles. Beyond that it does a similiar calculation when it claims Trump is at his Hotels 30% of his time...it fails to even mention conflict of interest or do *any* analysis of what this means, granted any conclusion drawn from such a bad calculation would have to be pretty broad to not be wrong, hell add another few dubious activieties of Trump and you'd find out he spend 125% of his time golfing, visiting his hotels, getting massages, meeting with lobbyists etc.\n\nThe headline is intended to make you think \"this is bad, Trump is bad\" and your comment shows that it succeeded in that regard, even if you haven't read the article itself. When you actually read the article it becomes obvious that the intention is not to do good journalism and raise valid issues but to reafirm the readers views regardless of whether there are good facts supporting its message, it just assembles a bunch of bad looking numbers, does some shitty math, adds some talking points and leaves you with that.",

The Mail still has all kind of other reprehensible shit that they're responsible for. \n\nLike [that time they tried blackmailing one of the famously reclusive Wachowskis](http://www.windycitymediagroup.com/lgbt/Second-Wachowski-filmmaker-sibling-comes-out-as-trans-/54509.html) (The Matrix directors/creators) with the threat of public outing as transgender, a threat they subsequently made good on. \n\nThen there's shit like their [\"Vaccines cause autism!\"](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-171316/MMR--The-Truth.html) nonsense, [\"Cannabis causes schizophrenia!\"](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-2053486/cannabis-joint-cause-psychiatric-episodes-similar-schizophrenia-damaging-memory.html) nonsense, [\"Asbestos **doesn't** cause cancer!\"](https://www.theguardian.com/science/the-lay-scientist/2010/sep/27/asbestos-press-watchdog-pcc) nonsense, and the simple [flat](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1260253/Teachers-leave-boy-5-tree-health-safety.html) [out](http://web.archive.org/web/20100331151454/http://www.learningtolovelearning.co.uk/files/Letter%20to%20parents%20re-%20newspaper%20articles.pdf) [lies](http://web.archive.org/web/20100331150406/http://www.learningtolovelearning.co.uk/files/Letter%20to%20parents%20re%20newspaper%20articles%202.pdf) they tend to publish.\n\nThis just isn't a left vs right kind of debate, man. \n\nHell, I've personally considered the Independent to be a rag ever since they published [this](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/anger-after-saudi-arabia-chosen-to-head-key-un-human-rights-panel-10509716.html) ultimately misleading article back in 2015. They're after easy clicks at the expense of honesty and accuracy, no question about it. \n\nBut the *Daily Mail*? As bad as they might be, they don't have shit on the Daily Mail. \n\n",

Nonetheless it's a hit piece.\n\nI'm going to have to ask that you stop making me come to the defence of the Indepedant, because that's kinda a terrible example as well. \n\n[A major portion of Hans von Spakovsky's career has revolved around voter identification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_von_Spakovsky), just look at that overview. Approving and advocating for a photo ID law in Georgia which was subsequently overturned as unconstitutional, opposing the re-authorization of the Voting Rights Act in 2006, his \"inability to recall\" his involvement in the aforementioned ID law during his confirmation hearing. \n\nAnd if all that shit weren't enough, feel free to order up [a copy of his book](https://www.amazon.ca/Whos-Counting-Fraudsters-Bureaucrats-Your/dp/1594036187), in which he openly and explicitly makes exactly those kinds of claims.
