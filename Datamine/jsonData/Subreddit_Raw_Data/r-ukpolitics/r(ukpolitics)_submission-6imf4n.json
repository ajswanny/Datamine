    "body": "This is just way too simplistic to take any message from. The German economy has been VERY strong. It's one of the only economies in the world to really weather the crash, and the reason for that is they have been able to bundle their strong economy in with 16 dysfunctional economies to effectively devalue their currency and make their exports more viable. Poland is the biggest net recipient of EU funds and has been building its economy for a long time, from an ex-soviet basketcase to an east-west trading zone. They were also less exposed to the 2008 crash than the big Western European economies were. The UK was heavily exposed because of our banking sector. The French economy is interesting as their industry is flagging and although the economy has grown more than ours it is partly because they have been writing cheques to fund their lavish social welfare programs which they are going to need to pay down at some point. In many respects France took completely the opposite approach to us in dealing with the 2008 crisis and it will be interesting to see where we both stand in 10 years... FYI most economists project the French economy to be weaker than ours in the future. \n\nThe UK has had low or negative wage growth, but that has to be viewed in the context or record low unemployment. Essentially we decided to pay people less rather than pay some people nothing. It's far from ideal, but clearly there are some merits to it. I think the issue now is people in the UK are mentally done with the austerity narrative even though as an economic concept it is still ongoing. People want to know when they can expect to see their pay start to rise but it's really too early to say. If we were to actually see austerity through then we'd probably need another 5-10 years of it.\n\nWhen UK pay does start to rise it will probably be sharper than those countries listed here. I.e. People will be getting no pay rises or pay cuts for a prolonged period then a period of >5% pay rises which will effect a sort of catch up. That has historically been the case in the UK where pay tends to look a bit like a staircase with periods of sharp upwards growth and flat stagnation. The European economies tend to have pay growth that is more subdued but constant (like a gentle slope). The reasons for it are very complex but boil down to our services economy. ",

The government whichever party it is needs to look at focusing on productivity and exports IMO sooner rather than later or we could be looking at an ever tougher period to come.",

It's an illuminating and important statistic which you are trying hard to obscure.\n\n> The German economy has been VERY strong.\n\nThe Tories' claim has been that the UK's economy because of them is VERY strong. Given the Tories' boasting and their complacency, is \"Well Germany is VERY strong\" a good explanation for a 24% gulf in wage growth? I think not. Let's move on to the next point.\n\n> Poland is the biggest net recipient of EU funds and has been building its economy for a long time, from an ex-soviet basketcase to an east-west trading zone. They were also less exposed to the 2008 crash than the big Western European economies were.\n\nNobody thinks that Poland and the UK are like-for-like. The statistic clearly is provided to give context. The fact is that one could give almost any advanced coutry and its wage growth would come higher than the UK in that period.\n\n>  The French economy is interesting as their industry is flagging and although the economy has grown more than ours it is partly because they have been writing cheques to fund their lavish social welfare programs which they are going to need to pay down at some point.\n\nNo they haven't. Their debt as a percentage of GDP is pretty much the same as the UK's. The UK has also greatly increased its debt while the Tories have been in power. Next ...\n\n>  FYI most economists project the French economy to be weaker than ours in the future.\n\nEven after hard Brexit? Who are these economists? You're just making it up.\n\n> The UK has had low or negative wage growth, but that has to be viewed in the context or record low unemployment. Essentially we decided to pay people less rather than pay some people nothing. \n\nNo we didn't. We had a welfare safety net which ensured that the unemployed have a fixed income. Now we *don't* have a reliable safety net through the punitive sanctions regime, so we actually *do* have people with *literally zero* income when before we did not. So you could not be more wrong.\n\n> When UK pay does start to rise it will probably be sharper than those countries listed here.\n\nThis is quite hilarious, because you're trying to use as a positive something which has not materialized. Do you not realize how ridiculous that makes you look?",

It is arguably better than ours but hugh by the EUs standards. Most of Europes borrowing has also been on far less preferential terms than the UK. That is another hidden gem in these statistics, debt  alone is meaningless without knowing the interest rates it is being repaid at. British debt is extremely cheap to finance (indeed among the cheapest in the world). \n\nIn my opinion we could only have averted the fall in wage growth had we accepted greater unemployment - and that unemployment would likely have followed the pattern across the EU were it disproportionately affected the young adult workforce.

It's an illuminating and important statistic which you are trying hard to obscure.\n\nYou realise that what is called \"wage growth\" is not actually measuring the growth of individual wages right? Instead it is a measure of the change of the average wage. That means that if you start to employ a lot of people below the current average wage of the UK then that will pull the average down, and this is reported as a reduction in \"wage growth\".\n\nThe FT article the data comes from ( https://www.ft.com/content/83e7e87e-fe64-11e6-96f8-3700c5664d30 ) explains this at the bottom where the UK's increase in employment came mainly from part time workers. Some of these will be zero hours contracts. Some will be from immigrants happy to do minimum wage jobs in the UK. Some of them will be from lifestyle choices or from companies not willing to take on full time staff members.\n\nSo if the UK economy has a boom, and that boom is fuelled by a lot more jobs at the lower paid end as opposed to the very high youth unemployment rates we see in other countries, then that will come in as a reduction in the average wage for the UK, aka a negative wage growth.\n\nSo yes, yes it is way too simplistic. I mean we could have a massive increase in wage growth if we killed all the poor people. Or maybe kill all the poor people and raise interest rates.",

As you rightly point out, fiscal expansion was feasible because we had low borrowing rates - there was enough fiscal headroom. \n\nWithout prejudicing the argument about low run debt/deficit levels, I just don't see how a recession is the time and place to start dealing with them. The US is an instructive example in this regard. They undertook a stimulus approach and their recovery has left us in the dust.\n\nI wonder if we disagree fundamentally about what happened. To me, falling wages or some tradeoff into unemployment are a function of poor aggregate demand.

Temporal and\nspatial differences are differences of degree: though large, the general principle remains. As Edward\nWolff and Ajit Zacharias have pointed out, the upper centile always consists of several different\nsocial groups, some with very high incomes from capital and others with very high incomes from\nlabor; the latter do not supplant the former.\n\n>In the US case, as in France but to an even greater degree, the difference today is that one has to\nclimb much further up the income hierarchy before income from capital takes the upper hand. In 1929,\nincome from capital (essentially dividends and capital gains) was the primary resource for the top 1\npercent of the income hierarchy (see Figure 8.9). In 2007, one has to climb to the 0.1 percent level\nbefore this is true (see Figure 8.10).",
