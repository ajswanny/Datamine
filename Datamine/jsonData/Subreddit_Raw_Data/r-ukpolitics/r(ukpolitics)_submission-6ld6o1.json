It's always flowery language, and a carefully maintained public image that is chronically inoffensive and politically correct to a fault.\n\nPeople dislike him because he is not someone that engages in fair political discourse. He's a nightmare for people that want to sit down and hammer out discussion on policy and political ideology, which pretty much defines what this sub is about. If he does something wrong he just goes to a pride parade, \"ah, didn't do this campaign promise but look at me dancing with Sihks\".\n\nI don't hate him, but he's a deeply frustrating political character.

Europe is already highly developed and so gains are less impressive now, while non-EU countries have more room to develop.

It's kind of weird that brexiteers bring it up as an argument because it's not even a weak argument, it's a data point that undermines the case for Brexit.",

What you've said isn't even true, both major parties are committed to Hard Brexit.\n\nIt's a weakening in relations because the UK is leaving the political project. There is quite literally no way to leave a political project that includes significant political integration and not have looser ties afterwards. The point is that both Labour and the Tories have said that in the context of being outside of the EU, they want the strongest possible relationship.\n\n>No it isn't, because it's Britain that is leaving, unilaterally. The EU did not call the referendum, the EU did not use Article 50. If it's a weaker position it's because Britain decided to weaken the position.\n\nYes.. It's a weaker trade position because the UK won't be integrated into the EU's political project in the way it is now. It will, by default, have less impact on things like EU trade policy.  That's entirely reasonable since we won't be in the EU anymore.\n\n>Why are you Brexiters so ashamed to own your own decision? If you really believe in Brexit why you are trying to blame someone else for it?\n\nI'm not blaming anyone else for it... I don't see it as something that should  be blamed on anyone, it's the right thing for the UK to do at this point, and of course it leaves the UK and EU with a weaker relationship, because the UK won't be a part of the EU anymore.\n\nIt should be abundantly clear that as the UK leaves, and the UK and EU negotiate that both sides will have a say in what the relationship looks like after brexit.  The UK can't force the EU into a specific arrangement any more than the EU can force the UK. So the closeness of any trading relationship depends on both what the UK wants (seemingly very close ties, short of Single Market membership) and what the EU is willing to offer.\n\nThat's not controversial, it's not shifting the blame, it's simply how things are.\n\nThat said, the relationship that the UK and EU end up with can still be, and likely will be very close. We already do a lot, outside of the EU, with European states and we will likely want to continue to do a lot of things with the EU that are mutually beneficial.\n\nI mean, that is the entire point of leaving the EU. The idea is to end up outside of the EU, leave the political project, whilst trying to ensure that we have the closest trade arrangements short of having to be part of that political project. On top of that the UK and EU will want to ensure that in areas of mutual interest, we have decent agreements and a decent relationship with the EU.\n\n>If I was more cynical I might think that you know you've fucked up, that Brexit can only be a disaster, so you're trying to pre-emptively spread the blame around.\n\nNot at all. This was the UK making a decision, it's the UK that is on its way out, and the UK will have to come to an agreement with the EU.  \n",

The UK has shown that it wants not only to trade with the EU and her members, but also with the world as a whole.

    "body": "But the ability to make our own decisions about which trade deals we want to enter into and with which partners *is* a matter of sovereignty.\n\nA significant drawback of EU membership, or more specifically of being in the customs union, is that while you have excellent trading terms with others within that union, it's a protectionist arrangement that also imposes severe limitations in trading with those outside.\n\nOne aspect of this is that you can't make independent trade agreements. It seems like often there's an unstated assumption in these debates that the EU will do better in international trade negotiations than the UK would anyway: the UK has few of its own negotiators, is smaller so has less bargaining power, etc. However, the less mentioned other side of this is that the EU has to negotiate deals in the possibly conflicting interests of all of its member states at once. Given that it took the EU 7 years to make a deal with Canada, and even that was briefly on the rocks because one area of one member state objected, and given that apparently the EU's larger size still isn't enough to reach a sensible deal with the US, the emperor's clothes do look a little thin here.\n\nThe other main aspect of being within the customs union is that you are required to apply the Union's customs policy for all external trade. That can mean prohibitive tariffs that push up the prices of goods from non-EU sources. In some cases it can even exclude them from the market altogether through regulatory means.\n\nIn isolation, much of this is unambiguously bad, so the whole issue is really a question of whether the benefits outweigh the costs. Reasonable people can differ on that point, but trade with non-EU partners already makes up the majority of our international trade and has been increasing slowly but steadily as a proportion of the total for some time now, so it's not an unreasonable position that limiting trade with non-EU partners to promote trade with the EU might not be in the long term interests of the UK. Certainly I know people within the business world who are pro-Brexit for these kinds of reasons, along with related issues like the overheads imposed by being in the EU's single market.",

Are we less sovereign for signing up to the UN? Following your argument, yes. Does that make it a bad thing? No. To cooperate internationally on a large scale, sovereignty must be pooled and delegated.\n\nRight, and those limitations are what, exactly, and what effects do they have on our economy?\n\nTrade deals always take years to write and implement, they are hugely complicated documents dealing with multiple jurisprudences. and often languages - which is a huge legal issue in itself. We could certainly sign trade deals once leaving, but it would take decades to get near to the level of openness we currently have. We have trade deals in effect or coming into effect with most of the world as a result of the EU. Whether we could potentially get better deals (from the perspective of most businesses and people) is unlikely, given as our leverage is in the form of financial institutions.\n\nRight, so which goods do these effect, and does this have a net negative impact on the UK economy, or the choice of our people wrt goods and/or services?\n\nIn isolation, you've given next to no detail, have ignored the boost the EU has given to us in terms of non-EU trade, that the EU is our largest single trade partner, and that our trade with them is still growing - its just that due to emerging economies, we have rapidly growing (but still very small amounts of) trade with others which will stagnate eventually. The main costs single market membership imposes are workers rights to paid holiday/breaks, and environmental regulations, neither of which are bad things in surely anyone's eyes. ",
