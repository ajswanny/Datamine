During his stay he was put into an uncomfortable back brace, and was left in a ward need for several days without any change of bed clothes or cleaning. The Italian doctor suggested that his spine had fractured and that he would have to be bedridden for 30 days.\n\nBy the time he came back to the UK, his back was covered in bed sores. The NHS nurses cleaned him up properly (something he was incredibly grateful for despite how undignifying it was), and the doctor revealed he didn't need to wear a brace as his spinal muscles were holding the fracture in place and that it was actually recommended he keep active. (As it turned out, they later compared his x-rays against his medical record and realised what they identified to be a fracture was actually a chip he had obtained in childhood and that he had simply sprained his back)\n\nHe was saying the contrast in experience between Italy and the NHS made him appreciate the NHS a whole lot more.\n\nEdit: This brings me onto my view. One thing my friend highlighted (even though he is a libertarian Tory) was that from what the Italian doctors kept saying, it seemed obvious that they were simply trying to find excuses to charge as much to his health insurance as possible. They didn't care about his well-being, they just wanted the insurance money. And that's what sets the NHS apart - because the hospitals aren't trying to turn a profit, they focus more on patient care.",

But we pay more for it.\n\nPrescriptions cost 5,10, or 15 euros a time. You never know which it will be or why it costs that much. \n\nWaiting times for seeing a GP or specialist are the same as they were in the UK. Namely, 2 weeks or 3 months. Therapist waiting lists are similarly long.\n\nWaiting in A&E was about 6 hours. It wasn't very busy. I've been through A&E in the UK with a similar level of health emergency on far busier days in the same or less time. The UK hospital, rated one of worst in the country, was so much cleaner than the German hospital. There was literal blood on the walls and floor from previous patients, and they added mine to it and didn't so much as wipe it up. \n\nGerman doctors have also added extra visits and unnecessary tests, leading to even longer waiting times. I was told by another doctor that this was a common attempt to make more money off my insurance. Meanwhile the patient suffers.\n\nThe NHS may need more funding, but I feel the majority of people harping on about how great other systems are haven't actually experienced the other systems.

    "body": "No one really has a chance at addressing the issue because no one has a proper conversation about it.\n\nIt has all devolved into petty points scoring, sensationalist headlines, fear mongering and partisan stubbornness that wont allow for a sensible, progressive conversation.\n\nThe so called Dementia tax was blown out of all proportion, I was also absolutely mad at it until I properly looked into what they are proposing and what the actual situation is right now. I still don't think it is the right solution, but it is not the dramatic horrific change it was originally made out to be.\n\nIssues like social care, ageing population, immigration (non English speakers requiring healthcare is expensive), rapid population rises (both from immigration and internal population growth/migration), adopting technology, far too many middle managers and 'diversity officers' being employed on top dollar wages and the overall culture of waste within the NHS all need looking at.\n\nNone of them are the single source of the problem, they all play their part and create issues, some more than others.\n\nRight now no one is truly talking about all of those issues in an honest and open way, which means we aren't even close to solving the key NHS issues and no party is helping on this front.\n\nAt some point the private healthcare example also needs to be looked at, not necessarily because we want the American system here, we don't, but because private healthcare is very well run and uses modern technology in a way that would really benefit the NHS. The examples set by private healthcare should be looked at objectively and not just instantly dismissed.\n\nBy neglecting to have a proper conversation and continually pumping masses of money into a hugely wasteful, inefficient organisation, all the politicians are doing is digging a deeper hole. NHS reform is coming, it will have to come, better we do a good job of it with a well thought out plan, than a bad last-minute rescue job.",

People *have* to pay because if all insurance companies raise premiums simultaneously, they have nowhere else to go. So if the \"natural\" cost of healthcare rises, it goes straight through to people's pockets.\n\nIn practice this makes it hard for people to afford insurance, so then governments get involved and start subsidising. That in turn means insurance firms have little incentive to start reducing costs or services. It's not a perfect system either.\n\nIn the UK, it's possible for people to collectively decide to deliberately underfund health. This is an option most other countries don't give people. Politicians of all stripes, whether they're right or not, seem to believe that nobody is currently willing to pay more tax to fund the NHS. That's why Labour are only willing to talk about corporation tax - people perceive it as a free pot of money, so it's the only tax they feel safe talking about. If they said they'll raise income tax to pay for the NHS they'd probably lose a lot of votes.\n\nThe Left like to blame the Tories for gutting the NHS but it's a decision the UK has collectively made. If Labour thought there were votes to win by raising personal taxation levels to spend on the NHS they'd be doing it, I have no doubt, but even Corbyn doesn't think he can get away with that.",

It's included in the insurance.\n\nNot in all insurances\n\n>They had to introduce that NHS helpline because too many people were using A&E incorrectly - the same people that will whinging about it being privatised no doubt.\n\nI would agree but the insurance companies in Germany are starting to do consultation over the phone/video consultations too. Many hospitals support an emergency doctor service for non life-threatening problems that must be dealt with quickly, but you will wait many hours for the drop-in service.\n\nAlso with German private cover, it goes up in price as you get older and you always have to make the dcision whether to claim or not for a doctor or a prescription as there are minimum limits per year and a \"no-claims\" bonus system. For example, I must pay the first \u20ac500 of claims in any year myself. I would then lose no-claims of \u20ac2000 or so, so before I use the system, I need to have \u20ac2500 of claims in a year.\n\n>That's it. Germany - the GP recognised he wasn't a psychiatrist, just a GP, so he sent me to see a psychiatrist straight away - the psychiatrist straight away (within a week) sent me for a CT scan.\n\nI don't know why the psychiatrist refers you for a CT. Normally that would be a neurologist, but perhaps it was to save time. However, there are a lot of such devices in Germany (more than the UK) and they need to be kept busy so sometimes I feel there may be some over prescribing.\n\nBtw, psychs would not be covered by all private insurances in Germany.\n\nLastly, because of fragmentation, the German system lacks negotiating power on drug prices and is unable to assemble so much information on health themes across the population.",

For one, there's a huge information asymmetry on both sides: evaluating patient risk is difficult for the insurance company, and medical treatment is difficult for a patient to evaluate (i.e. it's hard for them to tell the value of what they're getting). Competitive markets are great when everyone can evaluate the goods on offer properly. Further, choice is often quite constrained due to things like preexisting conditions, which make switching insurance impossible, basically leaving you at the mercy of your initial insurer.\n\nSecond, on data alone, it's clear that insurance heavy systems pay a great deal more for equivalent health outcomes. USA is a classic example.\n\nThird, this really fails to take into account public good (externality) arguments for healthcare. There's a benefit in not having people waste time figuring out to get health care, there's a quite obvious benefit to your populace not stressing about insurance premiums. And of course, the spread of diseases implies that it's to my benefit that you are kept healthy. That's a collective action problem and those don't get solved by profit motive. \n\nThat's before we even get to things like a) health insurance undermines risky entrepreneurial activity by locking people into employment to access health care or b) economic productivity due to a healthy working population\n\n",

    "body": "I wonder if you've lived in an insurance based country?\n\n> evaluating patient risk is difficult for the insurance company, and medical treatment is difficult for a patient to evaluate\n\nIt's not that hard - insurance companies have pretty reasonable ideas of who will need more care. The old, the HIV positive, people with a family history of hereditary illness, smokers. They are quite experienced at modelling this. You phrase this in a tricky way: \"difficult\" is too vague to debate. I can say it's easy, you can say it's difficult, who is to say who's right? It's subjective.\n\nThe latter statement however misunderstands the insurance model completely. It isn't the patient evaluating the detailed quality of their care. It's the insurers themselves. Obviously patients can tell some things like whether the hospital seems nice and took care of them, whether there are good in-coverage GPs near by. For things like \"was this treatment necessary\"  and \"which doctors deliver good outcomes\" the insurers are incentivised to investigate that and figure it out, and they do.\n\n> Second, on data alone, it's clear that insurance heavy systems pay a great deal more for equivalent health outcomes. USA is a classic example.\n\nUSA does not have mandatory health insurance. Or rather, it is trying to post Obamacare but it's not quite working out for them as enforcement is weak. This skews costs and makes them hard to measure - a lot of American healthcare ends up budgeted to A&E because the law mandates that uninsured people are treated in emergencies for free, so people just don't buy insurance and then turn up for emergency care when their condition gets _really_ bad and hard to treat.\n\nOther countries manage this a lot better.\n\n> There's a benefit in not having people waste time figuring out to get health care, there's a quite obvious benefit to your populace not stressing about insurance premiums. And of course, the spread of diseases implies that it's to my benefit that you are kept healthy. That's a collective action problem and those don't get solved by profit motive.\n\nThat's true. Life is simpler without having to deal with health insurance (which I do). However that argument could be extended to literally any life choice. Isn't it simpler if the government makes it for you? Well, yes, except what if the choice is bad? Then maybe I'd rather do the paperwork (which isn't heavy in most countries) and get a better outcome.\n\nThe latter issue is why vaccination programmes are mandatory. But much healthcare isn't to do with highly contagious diseases these days. They're sicknesses of old age, like dementia, that really stress the system. Rapidly spreading viruses are only an issue occasionally, like if there's an outbreak of the flu.",

    "body": "> In 2015/16 the budget deficit was 1.85bn. We're a trillion pound economy. There is no reason the government couldn't accommodate an extra \u00a32bn on the budget. It just chose not to.\n\nWhich deficit? The NHS deficit? The UK deficit is much higher than that.\n\nThe main reason governments don't care about NHS deficits is the perception that the NHS is always in deficit. It simply spends as much money as it's given immediately, then some more, and is always broke. You could give it an extra 2 billion tomorrow and it'd still be billions in debt. The problem is deeper and not something easily tackled by just throwing cash at the problem. At least, that is their view.\n\nOne reason the NHS lacks credibility with Tory ministers is that it's in the recent past:\n\n1. Wasted vast sums of money on attempting to modernise. The largest IT failure *ever*, in *the history of the world*, was an attempt to digitise the NHS. Every other industry has managed this, often several times, but the NHS has failed every time. That by itself wasted over \u00a310 billion and delivered very little.\n2. Despite such failures been given large amounts of money *specifically* to invest in efficiency and delivery upgrades, i.e. spend money to save money. The NHS promised it could do that, that it would do that. Instead the money was instantly spent on other things and nothing was made more efficient or modernised.\n\nSo faced with this sort of long history, governments of all parties (Labour too, they just aren't honest about it) have been quietly concluding that you can't solve the NHS's problems with money. Moreover, voters don't believe it either, hence the refusal to increase taxes to try and dig the NHS out of its hole. Both left and right perceive it as electoral suicide because everyone would hate the tax increase, remember it, the money would go to the NHS and then .... the NHS would still be broke and collapsing. Nothing would change. So people would perceive the tax increase as having no effect. Not a good place to be, if you're a political party.\n\nForcing people to pay more for healthcare in the UK is probably only possible if you simply don't let them vote on how much they pay at all, i.e. switch to a mandatory insurance model.",

They think they can only get away with it as long as it's phrased as \"other people will pay more but not you\".\n\nI suppose I should have clarified my previous comment. Talking about income tax rises on a small minority is, for electoral purposes, more or less the same as not talking about raising it. As that's how it'd be perceived by voters. \n\nBut as sibling comments point out, giving healthcare inflation there's no way to fund this even if you simply confiscate 100% of earnings over a certain amount.

If I can remove a thousand bed days through shorter lengths of stay, I can probably close that ward and save that money.\n\nYou have identified a consideration but it's not actually a massive one. When winter pressure hits, I can hold back budget to reopen the ward October - March. I can reallocate those staff during the summer and bring them back to the ward in the winter busy season, backfilling their normal jobs with agency staff.

    "body": "Cheers for responding. I have always lived in the UK, although I am very close with people who live in the US. I'm curious as to your background also - you seem to be pro market insurance and actually live with it, which I don't come across often. \n\nFair point on being vague with \"difficult\". \n\nWhat I will say is that the larger the organisation the cheaper it is to spread uncertainty (which is insurance at the end of the day), and a single state insurer is the upper limit in terms of that scale. What that means is a state organisation doesn't have to add in as much buffer to its insurance premiums to guarantee breaking even (it also doesn't need to make a profit. Bear in mind that the required level of profit for a private company is set by market rate on capital, which itself is a function of quite a bit of rent-seeking i.e. higher than necessary). So private insurance already at a disadvantage (bigger or smaller than benefit of 'market efficiency'? Don't know but would say no). Also, insurance markets have to involve promotion, advertising, client retention etc, and that all costs money paid for by ... premiums.\n\nOn patient evaluation: Do you know for sure which insurance company will dick you about with some minor clause without paying out? If the insurance company does dick you around, can you definitely afford to go through the legal bullshit involved in bringing them to court? These are all information asymmetries. I feel like instances of insurance companies abusing their size to essentially breach contract is pretty standard. Now, you might say this isn't what you're arguing for, and that proper regulation would sort all that out, but to me that's the right wing version of \"USSR wasn't communist so doesn't prove communism won't work\". If you rely on profit motive, firms will do everything they can to make money - ethics just isn't relevant. If that means lobbying against regulation, using an army of lawyers to shit on the little guy, so be it. \n\nYour original post started with the point that the market can't control allocation when govt monopolises. In what sense would a free market insurance system change where money was allocated? Presumably you also need a free market healthcare provider (i.e. hospitals) and then there's clearly an information asymmetry between hospital and insurer, unless the insurer also checks the patient to make sure the hospital wasn't lying...doesn't seem very efficient.\n\nOn disease spreading, fair point, mandatory insurance should achieve a similar outcome. \n\nI don't really understand why having the government do it is seen as a minus? I guess your point is that government does it worse so there's a tradeoff for the 'less effort'. Well that's a cost benefit argument, and frankly I think national insurance has won it hands down. I mean seriously, if the NHS had an opt-out and you could get private insurance with all the bollocks involved, very few would do it, and that's in a situation where the govt insurance is setting a super cheap baseline for the market. \n\nRe USA, that's fair point that they don't have mandatory insurance, but they do have market insurance, and that's really the point you were making. We have mandatory insurance in the UK, except that its cost is income linked i.e. taxation. The argument really is whether getting private companies to do it would make it cheaper and for the above reasons I think not.\n\nYour example of people rocking up to A&E isn't just an insurance issue by the way, it's actually a copay issue. In the UK you pay for prescriptions (mostly). So, guy goes to see doctor (free), gets prescription (costs money), doesn't buy the meds prescribed, gets sicker -> A&E. So what's the solution? Make people pay in A&E or just give them free prescriptions? \n\nOk sorry for the word party.\n\n",

The UK has some of the lowest energy prices in Europe, last I heard.\n\n[Or not, as the case may be](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/personalfinance/energy-bills/11941251/British-energy-firms-charge-most-for-electricity-in-Europe-why.html) - our energy firms charge the *most*, we only avoid being most expensive overall because of low fuel taxes.\n\nPrivatisation has led to a plethora of tarrifs, which have been repeatedly shown to make it harder for consumers to get the cheapest deals. Then of course there is the supplier-distributor split which offers endless opportunities for creative buck-passing when things go wrong (see: rail privatisation.)\n\nYes, the railways.  Interesting one, that. I did comment not long ago that, although it is true that passenger numbers have gone up markedly since privatisation, they seem to be crammed into the same number of carriages, which gives the lie to one of the claims used to justify it, that the railways needed private investment in infrastructure. The reality is that most rail operators seem reluctant to invest in a new biro for the guard unless they can get it back as a subsidy.\n\nOf course, after an initial drop, [subsidies climbed dramatically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impact_of_the_privatisation_of_British_Rail#/media/File:UK_total_rail_subsidies_1986-2015.png) after people died or were seriously injured at Hatfield. So, while Lew Adams of Aslef (hardly a cheerleader for privatisation) [freely acknowledged improvements after privatisation](http://www.webcitation.org/6QFD5LQCC?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.pppcouncil.ca%2Fpdf%2Fcknw.pdf) he too mentions more money being spent. You acknowledge \"decades of underinvestment,\" and I would argue that it is increased investment that has helped, not privatisation per se. And most of that investment has still come from the tax payer, and far too much of it has gone not to improving rail infrastructure, but to the profits of rail companies (who, of course, could make wildly optimistic promises in the knowledge that they would be at least partially bailed out if/when it all went wrong. Of course, underinvest until the existing system can only fail, then insist that selling it all off to your business buddies is the only possible option is a classic Tory tactic, which they are now trying with the NHS.\n\nWhatever, it appears that a significant majority of us, including a smaller majority of Tory voters, [reckon that the railways should be re-nationalised](https://yougov.co.uk/news/2013/11/04/nationalise-energy-and-rail-companies-say-public/) - Oh, and the energy companies too!",

    "body": "I'm British but live in Switzerland, which has a mandatory insurance model (with government subsidies for lots of classes of people). For comparison I pay about \u00a3240 per month for basic insurance with a relatively high franchise. This means that in practice I directly pay for the costs of my own healthcare. The insurance is there only for if I hit some serious issue like needing an operation.\n\nWith respect to insurance companies profitability. Healthcare insurance is a low profit business:\n\nhttp://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2009/09/how-profitable-are-health-insurance-companies.html\n\nIt has margins of between 2-3% usually. For comparison the average profitability across all industries is about 10% and hospitals themselves have higher profit margins. Some people argue that you shouldn't measure insurance firms by profitability but by other metrics, I guess that can be reasonable, but on a raw profit basis health insurance does not actually add much overhead at all. That is not surprising - whilst it takes capital to set up and attract customers, it isn't a business with very high barriers to entry otherwise.\n\nWith respect to spreading risk. Reinsurance firms spread risk out amongst insurance firms. It isn't clear to me that reinsurance+insurance is less efficient at risk spreading than one massive nationalised insurer.\n\n> Do you know for sure which insurance company will dick you about with some minor clause without paying out? If the insurance company does dick you around, can you definitely afford to go through the legal bullshit involved in bringing them to court? \n\nAhead of time? No. But my experience is that insurance companies, at least where I live, do not have a reputation for doing that sort of thing. In my entire time living here I have never heard a story of health insurance firms trying to screw people over. I hear such stories from the USA, but here at least they seem to pay out quickly and without fuss. Perhaps it's because enforcement of mandatory insurance works better, so insurers have a larger pool of healthy people to keep them afloat. I think a lot of the aggressive business practices you find in the states are a consequence of healthy people going without insurance, which makes the remaining pool of insured people far riskier than normal, so insurers have to either raise premiums massively or try to reduce their risk exposure via other means. The bad practices occur on both sides: it's not fair to expect insurers to only insure high risk people at an affordable price.\n\nIf insurance firms dick enough people around though, they will get a bad reputation and I feel I'd hear about that sooner or later. In practice firms compete on the number of GPs they have, whether you get nice facilities at hospitals and on their premiums.\n\n> Well that's a cost benefit argument, and frankly I think national insurance has won it hands down. I mean seriously, if the NHS had an opt-out and you could get private insurance with all the bollocks involved, very few would do it.\n\nYes, these things are cost benefit arguments. The assumption behind insurance based schemes is that the government isn't very good at running large industries. That seems to have been true in most cases in the past, hence, communism and its failure. And the state of the NHS' business practices are not a good advertisement for the model either (still paper based 50+ years after the computer revolution began).\n\nBut it's certainly possible to get dysfunctional markets too, like the USA. Healthcare isn't a normal market.\n\nI suspect if governments calculated the true cost of the NHS into people's tax bills and then let people spend that money on private insurance instead, you'd be very surprised at how many people took the offer. Very surprised indeed. The NHS is a totemic issue on the political left because it represents untrammelled socialism on a massive scale, but for people of other political ideologies it's just a way to see a doctor. Private healthcare is positioned as a luxury good in the UK for a long time. If suddenly people could get it \"for free\" (i.e. without paying for the NHS on top) using a voucher scheme, then I bet uptake would immediately outstrip the capacity for the private sector to supply it. You wouldn't see a massive shift overnight because private sector hospitals are so rare in the UK, but you'd definitely see things start to change.\n\nMy views are the same on education by the way. Switch to a voucher scheme where you can opt out of paying for state education and watch the flood to private schools. They have a reputation for quality established over a long period  of time. We can argue whether it'd be sustained if the customer base massively expanded, or whether they'd engage in cherry-picking the \"best\" students, but I doubt that'd affect the impact of switching to vouchers.",

I'm trying to explain *why* successive governments (not just the Tories) don't give the NHS the money it says it needs.\n\n> I don't know how I can make this any clearer. The NHS is proven to be cheaper than a mandatory insurance model.\n\nProven how? The fact that the UK currently pays less would seem to not be proof given that you're also arguing the NHS is not getting enough money and is compensating with debt. Apparently the true cost of UK healthcare is higher and being avoided only via accounting methods.\n\n> Switching to a mandatory insurance model does not fix the perceived issues with our healthcare. The only change it would bring is shifting control from the government, to endless private firms and insurance companies.\n\nTo repeat my point, the main change it'd bring is that insurance companies would all collectively raise the amount people pay for healthcare significantly, most of that money would go to healthcare providers directly. So the UK would end up \"properly funding healthcare\", however, the definition of \"properly\" would no longer be under democratic control.\n\n> You're talking about cost as if we have control over it. We don't.\n\nApparently we do, hence the NHS being cheaper than other countries! So I'm not sure what you're arguing here. If you want people to be forced to pay the 'proper' funding levels then - given they tend to vote against that - you have to make it a non-votable decision. If you want to keep it government controlled you must accept the consequences when governments decide the population wants cheap-and-slightly-crappy rather than \"properly funded\".",

Your argument is that you didn't understand it and in fact took the opposite of what I was saying about it, and it doesn't sound very right to you and I'm biased for having read on it, you're unbiased for knowing sod all about it, so your impartial ignorance dictates I must be wrong.

From a personal perspective I know my local hospital is going to increase parking charges and start to charge disabled people. It will cause a stir but the hospital needs to do it. They are also talking about charging for patient meals. As they get squeezed they will have to make more difficult decisions such as these. Later on they'll need to limit care, although that is already happening to a degree where waiting lists are worsening.\n\nFWIW I don't think any of the parties have the right position on the NHS.

I'm getting my info here: \nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healthcare_in_Switzerland\n\nThe key features from what I can gather:\n- Insurers are not allowed to make a profit off of basic plans, only additional services (snazzier hospital food and shorter waiting times or similar?)\n- What they have to provide as basic is set by the government to basically include most stuff\n- The amount you pay is capped at 8% income and shortfall is made up by government subsidy\n- Your annual deductible is capped by the government, and your 10% co-pay is also capped by the government\n- Insurers \"cannot set any conditions relating to age, sex or state of health for coverage\"\n- \"level of premium [...] must be identical within the same company for all insured persons of the same age group and region, regardless of sex or state of health\"\n\nSo... no profits, government capped prices, income linked payment, government subsidy, obligatory insurance and no risk bsed pricing... it's not apparent Swiss health insurance has anything to do profit motive. There's a bit of discretionary stuff on top, and that's great, but that's a neutered market, and even the Swiss with their love of canton autonomy have got health insurance regulated to the eyeballs. I'm not seeing an example of the profit motive sorting out health care here.\n\nFrom the graph on that wiki, Swiss healthcare spending in 2011 was 91% (!!!!!) higher than the UK per capita in PPP terms. So virtually double. I get misty eyed thinking of the utopia we'd live in if we doubled NHS spending - reckon we would close the 2 year gap on life expectancy in short order. \n\nFWIW, there is private insurance available in this country, but as you say people are already paying for NHS so you have to be really wealthy (or expect to get really ill) before you have the cash for that kind of thing, and the prices reflect that income effect. No doubt in a voucher scheme it would look different.\n\nYes you're right that the NHS represents a huge socialist project. To some extent this is personal values. I like living in a country where people don't suffer and die from preventable conditions for being poor, and obviously I'm not convinced that we even pay a premium for the privilege (the reverse in fact), and data from Switzerland and the US still supports that contention in my view. I'm happy to pay for that. As John Dunne said, 'no man is an island'. \n\nRe general points about citizen choice and voucher schemes (and this also relates to someone else's point about comparing insurance and govt provision in one country): We're both talking out of our arse really if we want to make predictions about level of demand for voucher insurance, though just comparing price A to price B tells me it looks unlikely there will be much interest. These schemes might look attractive, but they only work because the government is supplying a non-profit baseline they have to compete against. If the government scheme went away, prices would rise. Not only that, but in healthcare the govt keeps all the high-risks and private firms cream off the low risks.  \n\nAnd also private schools... of course they're better, they have way more money :)\n\n",

If you run a manufacturing business you'd rather pay $1m for a machine that will do the work of one person, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 52 weeks per year.\"\n\nThe problem with this is that there would not be anyone to purchase any goods if they're all unemployed by the robots. Therefore the government has to:\n\nTax companies heavily for robots in something known as a 'robot tax.' They use the robot tax to then redistribute wealth to all the unemployed people. They could try to tax them enough to raise the capital for a basic income but not enough to make them uncompetitive.\n\nRegardless, immigration or automation will both have problems that can't be addressed at this very moment. \n\n>\"It does, a little, but I think the effect is somewhat overstated. Usually we're talking about a few percentage of the population at most.\"\n\nThere were 900 doctors in Ethiopia who have to serve 78 million Ethiopians, there were more Ethiopian doctors on the East Coast of America than there are in Ethiopia. Does that not seem like a dire situation? (well this was in 2008 from my source.)\n\nhttps://sites.google.com/site/davidhshinn/Home/african-migration-and-the-brain-drain\n\n>\"But we can just train the people here.\"\n\nWhat if they're just aren't enough people who want to do that stuff? I.E be a nurse or teacher which is an underpaid and difficult job.\nIn fact a lot of EU nurses are leaving the country and we're going to have a shortage in our NHS, we can't just magic up the number of nurses so quickly.\n>\"No, I mean that 'jobs are where people create value' in the context you said it implies more jobs is good, which is sort of true, but the marginal productivity of +1 job in some areas is THOUSANDS of times higher than in other areas. More manual labour isn't really more productive if it's just delaying automation which will be more productive in the long-run. In fact, the massive slavery of the Roman Empire is thought to be one reason they didn't advance as much: they didn't need to.\"\n\nThis still doesn't per se nullify my point that jobs create value but rather changes the argument to *how much value are we talking here?* Again, when I put immigration in relation to the context I meant skilled immigration and more on the side of medical needs for old people. \n\n>\"\"Money is basically value\" is misleading because the amount of value that a pound represents can change.\"\n\nUntil the day everyone decides that the \u00a3 is worth absolutely 0 then it still has a non zero value therefore my point is not wrong but rather you playing semantics and not furthering an actual point.

Letting the private companies take over too? \n\nIf you want to give me some direct evidence of it but despite that I'm a layman you just take your position of authority and suggest conspiracy - I don't really believe it. Simple as that, if the NHS becomes so bad that private is the only option, people simply aren't that stupid as you may believe. \n\nHonestly, if you want to provide evidence of this conspiracy I am all for it, if I'm totally honest I know little, but I simply don't believe it. It makes no logical sense, to risk the whole conservative party over some dollars to virgin? Nice meme.\n\nSo, pass me some stuff other than \"well the management sucks\" because yeah, changing the management system in 2012 is going to move things around, for better or worse in the long term. In the short term, yeah it's probably going to suck dick.\n\nBut if you would like to pass some sources then sure, I'd be happy with that.

Also the level of corruption over procurement and the handing out of huge contracts is absolutely not beneficial to the public at all.\n\nWhat I would like is more people to have a less partisan conversation over these things. I believe private and public ownership has a role in a lot of national infrastructure, but it has to be done intelligently and correctly. The only thing that gets that is open and honest discussion, not petty points scoring and agenda based political arguments.\n\nSome organisations are a little too big to manage centrally, such as the NHS. I think you are right that Westminster should be setting the direction for the NHS and provide targets and overall policy and strategy. But the actual implementation of it should be down to the trusts, because individual trust requirements and priorities, funds etc. are different.\n\nYou can't do one huge project of reform for the entire NHS at once, it is too big, it would never get finished correctly and will end up like the \u00a310billion IT project that took nearly a decade and ended up not even being used. That is an utterly ridiculous amount of money to spend on IT, the fact it ended up being completely wasted is so bonkers I can't even comprehend it.",
