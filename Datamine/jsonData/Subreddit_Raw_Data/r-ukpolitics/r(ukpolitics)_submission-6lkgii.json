One of the managers in the office claims that the minimum wage is the worst thing to ever happen in this country... followed by the minimum holiday entitlement. His argument goes like this: \n\nWhen he was young, there was no minimum wage and companies had to compete against each other to get the best employees. Now that there is a minimum wage, all companies just pay the minimum wage. Needless to say, he offers minimum wage for a job that should pay more, and has a frighteningly high employee turnover rate, terrible results, and his job is beginning to look very shaky. He earns well above the minimum wage. \n\n\nOne time while he was on one of his rants, one of the younger (remainer) employees asked what he thought about other rights, like maternity leave for example.

Can anyone legitimately say they voted for X party, and they were then 100% happy with their performance on delivering on all the reasons they initially voted for them ? \n\nThat said, I do think it's a long journey and we are only right at the start.

So are you saying the UK economy is just as bad? On top of this printing money is done for multiple good reasons such as:\n\n* Replacing old notes\n\n* Growing economies require more cash as the demand rises (more customers, more goods, ect) otherwise you just bottleneck your growth\n\n* A hidden tax, and no tax isn't bad, it's required for a running goverment\n\nAlso you're linking the independent and forbes as sources? They're click bait trash sites. At this point that's almost as bad as linking the daily mail or the sun and their lies too. And yes they are misleading you in those articles, it takes two seconds to google for [public debt as a persentage of GDP](https://www.google.co.uk/publicdata/explore?ds=ds22a34krhq5p_&met_y=gd_pc_gdp&idim=country:uk:de:fr&hl=en&dl=en#!ctype=l&strail=false&bcs=d&nselm=h&met_y=gd_pc_gdp&scale_y=lin&ind_y=false&rdim=country_group&idim=country:uk:de:fr:it&ifdim=country_group&tstart=1183676400000&tend=1467759600000&hl=en_US&dl=en&ind=false) which both of those articles call out, and you'll see for yourself that out of the largest four EU countries (largest referring to economy size) the UK has had the worst increase in public debt compared GDP since the financial crash.\n\nPlease, tell me how we're going to succeed in our economy without our largest trading partner since using your logic our economy is already being fucked? If you actually want to know about the risks of public debt you could at least go and read the [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_debt#Risk) article on it so that you at least know the basics of what you're talking to rather than making broad assumptions based on speculation.\n\nEdit: missing word",

They both attract isolationist, populist policies and rage against a system. \n\nI don't think the solution is to bash the billionaires anymore than it is to bash immigrants. We need a Europe and American wide solution at minimum. Calling for high taxation on the wealthiest in the UK *without* trying to also mention the low-tax in Europe and America is economically stupid. The speeches and debates from some people on the left always seem to pretend the solution is national and not international, that by simply raising taxes on the rich in the UK will be all okay. Job well done. Well, no.\n\nThe movement of capital and labour flow doesn't seem to be ending anytime soon, regardless of Brexit and Trump.

The growth in 2016 was just something that defied predictions of catastrophe prior to the result. But of course new predictions are made and people forget they were wrong the first time round.\n\nThe point about the economy is broader and more long term. It was a mistake to create a low-wage economy dependent on cheap migrant labour from Europe. Of course cutting off that supply of labour will damage the economy in the short-term, but there is a long-term need to restructure our own economy into one that makes use of domestic labour instead. Of course we depend heavily on foreign investment, some of which we're likely to lose, but we oughtn't to have gone down the path of destroying our own domestic industry and exporting almost nothing. \n\nI think the whole project of globalisation has been a mistake. The EU is part of that project. The economic downturn expected from leaving is contingent upon us having a 'globalised' economy. All of it is part of one huge mistake. The course correction might be painful, but if you want to understand the Leave position, you need to understand that it goes deeper than a year-on-year cost-benefit analysis. To insist on tangible economic benefits from 'beginning preparations' somewhat misses the mark. I don't think anyone expected economic benefits, and most people's vision is broader than that.",

So in terms of fairness for everyone that wants to come here we have one rule for some and another for others. In terms of harmonising the rules surely this is a logical and sensible aim?\n\nAdditionally Australia, with it's points system, has the ability to choose how much immigration it wants. If it needs more people to fulfill the demands of the time it has the flexibility to adjust the points system to account for that. If it needs to grow the infrastructure to cope with the growing demand atbthe time it can adjust the points system likewise. Again I don't think that is an unreasonable aim.\n\nIt is those aspects of an Ozzie points system that are attractive, not simply as an instrument to lower immigration.\n\nI'll say again, this seems immediately obvious to me from listening to the debate but clearly it hasn't been explained well enough given the amount of people who think this is a pure evil policy of racism. I'm not for a second saying that's what you were implying, however the rhetoric is there from most commentators on this topic.\n\nI personally think an arbitrary figure is a duff policy.

Both sides being deliberately difficult towards each other. Their is a gerenal aura of pettiness, childish behaviour. E.g.

What I hoped would happen if leave were to win (as they did), was the EU being dissapointed, but they would follow their own morals and principles that they oft talk about (inclusionism etc). Instead, from what I can tell, they are incredibly bitter about it, and are making it difficult. Our Government are then worsening the matters by being difficult and awkward too. There seems to be no effort towards achieveing a mutually beneficial agreement, but rather, who can hurt the other one the most. \n\nTo add, I don't think going into it cocksure  and have-your-cake-and-eat-it attitude that the UK Gov went into it with was wise at all. There would obviously have to be fair concessions. \n\nRight now, unless something changes, I think the discussions will fail. I think the Brexit \"deal\" will be bad.

You get my point?\n\nAnd we have the French, Russian, Cuban and Chinese revolution as historical examples of what happens when \"bashing the rich\" becomes a national pastime. \n\nJK Rowling and Oprah Winfrey are two billionaires who for example are not in my view, the kind of wealthy elites that need to be bashed. Compared to say Donald Trump or Richard Branson. I don't see what is to be gained by simply reducing the narrative to 'hate the rich', when surely we're trying to get the sympathetic rich on our side to further our cause? For example, JK Rowling who has supported left-wing causes with tens of \u00a3 millions and yet some people on the left hate her, simply because she has become a billionaire.\n\nMy point is a bit nuance, I am agreeing wealth inequality is a serious thing that needs to be tackled urgently, I'm just concerned people on the left are generalising multi millionaires and billionaires.

Somehow, in a way he doesn't even vaguely explain, this is bad for unemployed people.\n\nAt this point I gave up listening as he just rambles on without any rational or sense.",

As much as I can see why these people support it, I can't help feeling like it is mostly for their own gain (more so the second video, the first makes a more convincing argument although I disagree that the Euro will fail in 3 - 5 years). What stood out most for me was in the second video where he argues better working conditions are bad because they cause unemployment (no explanation given for this), I just feel that applying that mentality could be problematic especially after we saw what happened at Grenfell Tower when that red tape was cut. Thanks for the insight though. \n\nEdit: just one more point, I found the videos were still lacking any explanation (I understand they're short so that may be the reason), but they just make sweeping statements without anything to really back it up - e.g. \"a lot of money is wasted with the rebait\", but how? why? Remain were guilty of this during the referendum as well and I think that contributed to them losing. ",

I believe Commonwealth citizens are also treated slightly differently when it comes to immigration. Trade deals with other countries may also involve matters of migration, forcing us to treat yet more people in a preferential manner.\n\nI don't dispute that some people do want a fairer immigration system, but I would be very surprised if that was anywhere near a majority of the reasoning behind it. I think a lot of Leave voters would feel hard done by if we had higher immigration, despite having full control or a fairer system.\n\nFreedom of movement, if we enforced it correctly, should allow for natural balancing of migration without needing to explicitly control it. You can come here if you already have a job lined up or to look for work for 3 months, after that, if they have no job we *could* kick them out. Thus if there are available jobs there is demand for workers, people will get the jobs and it's fine because we needed the supply. If there's no jobs available then they won't have or get a job and would have to back home.",

    "body": "I'll preface this by stating that in my experience, headlines are nearly always misleading, or economical with the facts to one degree or another, to get people interested enough to read them.\n\n>Banks boost UK hiring despite Brexit, recruiter Robert Walters says 2 months ago\n\n\"Banking hiring trends are extremely volatile as companies often announce new jobs only to announce hiring freezes just weeks later, and Walters said it was too early to know if the improvement was sustainable.\"\n\n\"Larger rivals PageGroup (PAGE.L) and Hays (HAYS.L) have so far pointed to a slowdown as firms rethink their ability to service EU clients from UK bases. They will report quarterly results on Wednesday and Thursday respectively.\"\n\n\"However, Walters said talk of banks moving jobs out of London due to concerns about their ability to trade across the bloc had died down.\n\nLanguage barriers, a shortage of housing and challenging labour laws in other European capitals are barriers to moving. \"\n\nThe headline, then is clearly optimistic. It should read: One firm reports higher recruitment in London Investment Banks, somewhat against the trend reported by larger rivals. \n\n>Job optimism at three-year high despite Brexit 6 months ago\n\n\"The report said the biggest headache for employers was a shortage of suitably skilled workers, especially if Brexit makes it harder to recruit staff from other countries.\"\n\nClearly then, we actually need immigration to deal with the shortages.\n\nWhat is interesting is this:\n\n\"The study said the skills shortage was particularly acute in the building trade, with scaffolders and bricklayers being paid up to \u00a324 an hour.\"\n\nGreat if you're a UK scaffolder/bricklayer. You'd vote for Brexit to keep out immigrants \"forcing wages down\".\n\n\n>Despite Brexit, France wants to include UK in European defense efforts 3 months ago\n\nThis is a given, and will be be of the main talking points of the negotiations. Whether we leave or not, we still have a pan-European responsibility to work together on security issues, for the safety of all citizens. \n\n>House prices on the rise despite Brexit fears 3 months ago\n\n\"A fundamental driver behind the rise is the country\u2019s continuing property shortage, with the CEBR pointing out the government\u2019s own white paper on housing states that 40pc of local planning authorities say they do not know how they will meet local housing demand over the next decade.\"\n\nHouse prices are of course multi-factorial; but mostly little to do with the EU and Brexit. They're driven by interest rates, and supply/demand, and sometimes by immigration, increasing population size, low exchange rates, i.e. a cheaper pound attracting foreign buyers.\n\nRising house prices aren't great for millennials, who've seen wages stagnate and jobs dry up by the way. Getting on to the housing ladder, and being financially able to support a family is one of their biggest concerns. So rising house prices aren't necessarily a good thing anyway. \n\n>Britain still seen as major global player despite Brexit 3 months ago.\n\nThis is a classic example of headline not matching article.\n\n\"Some 57 per cent of the public across 25 of the world's biggest countries think the UK is a positive influence on world affairs, polling by Ipsos MORI found.\"\n\nCosta Rica, by using 100% renewable energy, probably has a large positive influence, for all we know. \n\nOr you could just look at this:\n\n\"And many countries are seen to have a better contribution than Britain, including Germany (67 per cent), Australia (79 per cent) and Canada (81 per cent), which topped the list.\" later on in the article.\n\n>UK getting happier despite Brexit uncertainty 3 months ago\n\n\"A survey of 1,000 people in more than 150 countries asked them to rate their happiness on a scale of 0-10 based on income and life expectancy, along with their feelings about social support, personal freedom, corruption and generosity.\"\n\nApparently, we score 6.5 in 2015 and 6.8 in Dec 2016. \n\nThis is now July 2017. I'd welcome a repeat.\n\nI do find these results hard to square with food bank use, junior doctors strikes, public sector wage caps, the Snooper's Charter and what's looking like a merciless DWP.\n\nNonetheless, I'll let it slide. So, between 2015 and Dec 2016, we were happier, despite Brexit. \"Getting happier\" needs up to date numbers. \n\n>Japanese firms have gone on a UK spending spree despite threatening to quit Britain post-Brexit 6 months ago\n\nYou call this good news? What happened to \"taking back control\"?\n\nSo our businesses are now going to be foreign-owned. This means that they could hire Japanese or other foreigners to fill positions. They could even strong-arm the government into relaxing visa requirements. So much for \"controlling our borders.\n\nMore importantly, it means that company profits go back to Japan, not into boosting the UK economy. We might see some tax revenue, a measly 19% if the Tories have their way. Welcome to bargain basement UK.\n\n>Qatar's UK investment to surge despite Brexit 3 months ago\n\nLink broken\n\n> Best EU brains are still coming here despite Brexit, says UCL university chief 2 months ago.\n\n\"Professor Michael Arthur, provost of UCL, said the new appointees would fill \u201cbig jobs\u201d and had been attracted by the capital\u2019s outstanding reputation for science.\n\nHe added that the appointments showed \u201cpeople have not been put off by Brexit\u201d and the \u201cvery best\u201d talents were still keen to take posts in London. \n\nHe also disclosed that there had been no exodus of European staff since last June\u2019s vote and that the university was optimistic it could retain significant numbers of EU students after Britain\u2019s departure. \"\n\nThis is indeed encouraging, even if it is from one source, and in London.\n\nThe obvious question then is if we are so glad that we can still attract the best brains in Europe, why are we risking losing them by Brexit in the first place?\n\nOr shouldn't we be using British brains to \"make Britain great\"? \n\n>UK tech sector is more attractive despite Brexit 3 months\n\n\"\u201cThe research shows the UK\u2019s technology sector drew more investment than that of any other European country in 2016 and that London is seen as a major hub for big data, fintech and a variety of digital technologies,\u201d said Tudor Aw, head of technology sector at KPMG UK.\"\n\nNow this is good news. Unfortunately, you might want to explore the implications of May's \"Snooper's Charter\". \n\nOverall, these headlines seem overly optimistic, and further scrutiny reveals some cracks in the facade. \n\nOf course, there will be winners and losers from Brexit.\n\nThe problem is that the winners will be the usual suspects: London, the already wealthy, whilst the losers will be the poor turkeys in the rural and ignored areas who voted Leave as a protest against Cameron and the Tories.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n",

There's no net gain of revenues being created from leaving the EU, therefore leaving does not create more funding for the NHS. In all likelihood it weakens NHS funding, since the funding comes from the budget which no economist forecasts to be strengthened by this isolationism.  \n\n\"Mass unskilled immigration causes wage suppression. There are ultimately no drawbacks from being able to limit and audit who is allowed to work here.\"\n\nAre you talking about unskilled immigration from eastern-euro areas to Britain? If so, the EU laws require wages to be paid at the normal rate of wherever the work is actually being performed, not where the worker is from.  So it's not like wage disparity is something the EU just flatly ignores in favour of their \"ultra capitalist\" policy as you put it.  Ofcourse companies break/circumvent these laws all the time in order to increase profits, but that's not the EU's fault, human deviance of the law is a universal fact of life. It's not like British companies won't still try to exploit British laws if given the opportunity (look at the existence of zero hour contracts in the UK).  \n\nNow if you're talking about mass unskilled immigration from the ME, or Africa or Asia then I'd say it's definitely just an argument based on fear, considering in no way does the EU just let anyone in.  \"There are ultimately no drawbacks from being able to limit and audit who is allowed to work here.\" Except this already happens with immigrants coming from outside the EU zone, so again Brexit would be changing nothing in that regard.  If anything, you'll be weakening your ability to \"audit\" people as you put it, by cutting yourselves off from shared EU databases of information.  ",

For the EU *political* project, it does not look good if the UK gains from being outside of the EU. But then the question arises, if the EU is as good as they deem it to be, why are they going out of their way to make UK leaving as bad as possible for us?

Leaving the EU in itself should prove that being an EU member is a net positive, if that were actually true. They'd just let us leave, and us + the world would see it was a mistake. But they seem to be worried that may not actually be the case, so they are deliberately imposing huge bills and crazy requirements/restrictions to make sure it hurts us, and to scare others into staying. \n\nAll of which essentially proves there is no interest in bettering the countries of Europe, but rather just establishing a political powerhouse. They don't truly want member states to be successful, prosperous and so on (atleast for their own sake). Otherwise there would be no problem with us leaving. They'd be happy for us.

If the EU is seen as actively screwing the leaving member then it will change the dynamics of the relationship between member states and the EU. Admittedly it could result in some members remaining while they otherwise would not due to fear, but I also think it would result in getting harder to get member states to pool sovereignty as they know they won't be able to retract from it in the future and make independence movements (of which there are many) more likely to become violent as they know that can't relay on the EU being reasonable anyway.

In the short term, we are going to be less affected. In the long term, a lot of the parts of the country that heavily rely on EU funds (such as Cornwall) are just completely fucked. Right now we have a Conservative government that still believes in austerity. Perhaps another election will be called and that will change, but right now it's Tory. There is no fucking way they're going to borrow vastly more to shell out the same amount of money to places like Cornwall, when it seems likely that the money we'd be saving from not sending to he EU would be going into an exit fee and into increased tariffs.\n\n> All of which essentially proves there is no interest in bettering the countries of Europe, but rather just establishing a political powerhouse.\n\nI see we have vastly different definitions of the word 'proves'.

For all of your apparently reasonable comments (and you do seem like a reasonable person who put thought into their decision) you are still vastly oversimplifying this to fit with your narrative, and I think that's a great shame.\n\nThe whole thing puts me in a shitty situation because I have Dual English-Irish citizenship, and so I would prefer if the UK comes out of this well, but I also want the EU to stay together.\n\n>  There is no interest in the greater good of the world, it's people or member states, just on empowering the EU and those that run it. \n\nI'm very curious if you've had any experience in EU conferences and collaborative projects.

The UK have completely fucked this. The EU haven't done anything wrong at any stage - we've chosen to leave at any cost, and they're merely pointing out that cost is very high. We elected an incompetent government to manage the exit too. There's no aspect of this that is the EU's fault, but when you're a Brexiteer whose fault it actually is - every single consequence of Brexit - I'm sure it's comforting to try to point fingers at the hated 'EUSSR' rather than take personal responsibility for ruining the country.

So the risk is exactly the same now, in the EU, as it would be out of the EU.\n\nEU-wide legislation on the minimum wage would be disruptive in the same way that a single currency is disruptive: it would be a centrally controlled attempt to level things across a hugely diverse continent with a lot of economic inequality and varying working cultures. From the EU documents on current minimum wage laws across the EU, it looks like the aim would *probably* be to eventually bring the minimum wages in line with each other, raising them in poorer countries and suppressing them in richer. We don't even have a single minimum wage across all of England, because London is so economically different from the rest of the country. ",
