    "body": "I can see three other explanations:\n\n1. They're looking to maximise the economic shock in order to wipe as much of the slate clean as possible and allow the new UK to be reshaped in their preferred image. This also has the added bonus of maximising the potential profits for the disaster capitalists. The ERG need to be placated with the idea that this is a viable option lest they collapse the government, but it's the one that causes the most long-term damage to the Tory brand - effectively destroying their reputation for economic competence, the only thing that actually gets them elected - and so the majority of Tory MPs won't let this pass. There is also a big risk in this scenario that their libertarian dream is hijacked by Corbyn's socialistic programme.\n\n2. They're looking to kick this into the long grass by making a transitional deal of indeterminate time that runs until Labour are in power and then they can deal with it, as completing Brexit in one way or another would surely be the (not so unspoken) elephant in the room for the next election campaign. This is the option that spreads the blame for the fallout from Brexit as wide as possible and limits the damage to the Tory party's electoral prospects.\n\n3. They really are this inept/arrogant/hubristic. I read an article a few months ago about the difference between the British and EU negotiation strategies in general. We like to make things up as we go along, whereas they are rules-based and plan for every contingency. Our strategy has been successful in previous European negotiations as we could always threaten to halt progress or even pack our bags but, now those options are no longer available, the EU's approach is much more likely to succeed. \n\n\nWithout a 2nd referendum to give democratic legitimacy to the idea of cancelling the whole endeavour, EEA in all but name seems the most likely outcome whichever of these 4 is closest to the truth. It's the option that negates most of the damage of Brexit while still enacting the result of 2016's vote.",

This mentality of self loathing widespread. Remember the \"immigrants do the jobs we don't want to do\" mantra, which has died down a bit now but was boilerplate up until a few years ago? It stems from this outlook. So, push forward 20-30 years, and we find ourselves in a situation where en employer feels no guilt or shame in having a 90% non-British workforce, indeed quite the opposite, he feels proud because he gets to feel like he is pro-foreigner and by implication, anti-racist. It also filters through in many other ways - we prefer foreign produce in our shops, we prefer foreign-made cars. It's harmful in a globalised world where we compete with Japanese people who have an in-built bias towards buying Japanese. In a fair economic fight, we are certain to lose long term. \n\nSo when a question about immigration is put to a national poll, it's not too surprising people ignored the expert warnings and trusted their own instincts.

Hiring in IT I\u2019ve never had a problem with a non British European, they\u2019ve all been hard working, educated and eager - a depressingly large percentage of the Brits I\u2019ve had apply for L1 posts fail to pass even the basic literacy and numeracy screens (how you can get to your 20s in a western democracy without basic language and math skills still appalls me).  I\u2019m sure there are plenty of Eastern Europeans back home in their countries with equally poor skills and educations but they\u2019re not the ones who come here applying for IT jobs.  I wouldn\u2019t say I\u2019m proud to hire immigrants, it\u2019s just that I hire the best people for the job and that\u2019s often immigrants - customers won\u2019t accept a second rate service just because they know it\u2019s being delivered by a native after all.\n\nThe preference for foreign made I feel is a symptom of the redirection of National effort in terms of what we do as a country.  We don\u2019t make things any more, we assemble some stuff but slapping a Japanese car together using imported parts in a northern facility does not a British car make.  We do finance and services now, and we do them very well (arguably the best in many areas) but that doesn\u2019t employee a huge number of people nor result in stores full of \u2018made in britain\u2019 products.  Much of the profit from these ventures trickles down through the benefit system but that\u2019s all it really offers the majority of average people today, allow the city to thrive and it at least affords you a pittance to have some kind of basic life but don\u2019t expect much more and so on...\n\nDemographic displacement is where we are headed imo.  It\u2019s already happening on a regional scale but we\u2019re yet to see much of a shift towards transnational movement (at least in the sense of lower skilled folk moving to less developed countries where their work is more in demand and the cost of living makes the overall standard of life higher).  The future may be a place where the place you live and work is more decided by Demography than nationality.",

You explicitly employing a native Brit over a foreigner means you are instantly put at a competitive disadvantage from your economic competitor. He makes a 25% cost saving on his labour cost. Where people have a blind spot, I feel, is that they don't understand that the sheer size of our domestic labour market has been artificially increased through political will. It's now EU-wide. Thought game, if the EU, or UK, decided to open the labour market for any CompSci grads or IT specialists, worldwide, then it's easy to see a situation where in 10 years, the Polish or Italian lads you currently employ are starting to look pretty lazy. I mean you can employ Mahatma and Jhodi for the price of one Sergio, and they are both way more driven because they come from even poorer countries. Does this mean Sergio is lazy, or is it more that your perception of value has been distorted? We see this played out on a global scale too. The patriotic business owner, who sources his goods from UK based ethnically made suppliers, soon finds himself unable to compete with the bottom-line business owner who ships over cheaper goods from China. Patriotic businessman's is thus forced to follow his own economic self interest, even if he knows it is contrary to the interest of the nation overall. Brexit, to me, was a vote to better harness these global forces and optimise them for Britain overall. It was a vote to maintain the status quo. Automation will be upon us soon, and countries that are stable and homogenous will fare better than ones that have a burgeoning underclass fractured along ethnic lines.",

Nah, just do evening classes. Minimum 1.5 hours 2 nights a week + homework for a couple of years and it probably still won't be enough. You need to be practicing a lot more than that. So you are working a full time job, going to evening classes, trying to maintain a social life, trying to keep up with your interests and hobbies but realistically unless you also make time to practice your German you're probably still not really making much progress, and there are only so many hours in the day.\n\nBy this point a lot of people just give up and just go home or commit to the \"expat bubble\" life. You can totally live in Berlin without speaking german. Pay people to sort shit out for you. Hang out with english speakers. Muddle your way though any german interactions. It's easy, but do you really want to be one of those people? Why are you even here in the first place if you don't actually plan on in any way integrating with the local population?

The difficulty comes when you need to itneract with the state such as registering, getting tax details or health insurance etc. But on a day to day level it's pretty easy. Plus everyone here is trying to improve their English, so the moment you show you don't know German, a majority of people will switch to English. I think that's because English is the default international place.\n\nI knew 2 people when I moved here. My girlfriend's aunt who put me up in a place for a week and an old mate.

    "body": ">I understand your perspective. In simple terms, your hand is forced. You explicitly employing a native Brit over a foreigner means you are instantly put at a competitive disadvantage from your economic competitor. He makes a 25% cost saving on his labour cost.\n\nBrits aren't more expensive (at least in IT) - you get paid the same regardless.  They're just harder to find.  I can get a EEU IT Tech in their early 20s with certs, maybe a degree, excellent written and spoken english (as a second language to boot) plus excellent numeracy quite easily.  Most of the Brits with that kind of skillset don't work outside the cities much - my pool is basically the people who aren't skilled or motivated (or whatever) enough to go to the work and come without the necessary skills far too often.\n\n>Thought game, if the EU, or UK, decided to open the labour market for any CompSci grads or IT specialists, worldwide, then it's easy to see a situation where in 10 years, the Polish or Italian lads you currently employ are starting to look pretty lazy. I mean you can employ Mahatma and Jhodi for the price of one Sergio, and they are both way more driven because they come from even poorer countries.\n\nGo back 15 years and it was a lot easier to get Indian/African IT staff than EEU.  That's what we used to do. If anything I'd agree, they tended to work even harder than the current lot - same point about these being the educated and driven self selected folk.  There's quite a bit of discussion at the moment about the whole thing going full circle so we're just going to be looking back to the old sources of migrant employment after Brexit.\n\n>The patriotic business owner, who sources his goods from UK based ethnically made suppliers, soon finds himself unable to compete with the bottom-line business owner who ships over cheaper goods from China. Patriotic businessman's is thus forced to follow his own economic self interest, even if he knows it is contrary to the interest of the nation overall.\n\nI've never met any businessman with more than a passing thought for local sourcing unless there is a fantastic time or cost benefit associated with it.  Supply chains are global and even the cutesy artsy store down the road from me orders their supplies in bulk from china.  It's a tough economy and you get no prizes for supporting local production (if it's even available).\n\n>Brexit, to me, was a vote to better harness these global forces and optimise them for Britain overall. It was a vote to maintain the status quo. \n\nI'd have said Remain was a vote to maintain the status quo.  Brexit looks like it will turn a huge amount of the economy on its head - you can already see the shape of what people like Fox et al are planning.  Low/no tarrif, low regulation, foreign produced products available to import in greater numbers and for less than ever before.  Hence his exhortations to British business to look outwards to new markets overseas - it will be harder than ever to compete domestically so either learn to export or find a new career.\n\n>Automation will be upon us soon, and countries that are stable and homogenous will fare better than ones that have a burgeoning underclass fractured along ethnic lines.\n\nIf we want to go dystopic then automation will be the point at which the skilled/wealthy etc try to cut themselves off entirely from the rest of humanity whom they will mostly write off as surplus to requirements.  I'd hope we're more, well, human as a species than to do that but I'm not always a great judge there...",

    "body": "> people are forgetting how much ground he made up in 6 weeks.\n\nNot at all. I'm not trying to say he didn't do well in the election, or take away from that performance. But it's important to remember both why he started so far behind, and that he still ended up in second place. I suspect he's probably doing well enough to win a GE next time around, but the question that /u/WoopyWoopyDo was asking, and it's one that's difficult to answer, is whether they would be doing better with someone else in charge.\n\nPersonally, I think they'll struggle to find someone else who can campaign as well as Corbyn, but that he isn't great as an opposition leader. I also think Labour are more appealing to a lot of people when further left than they were under Blair. \n\nSo, I don't know who else should be in charge, if anyone, but the last GE is evidence of Corbyn being a great campaigner and far more appealing than people originally expected (and perhaps that Labour should stay further left than they were under Blair) but not enough so to win against one of the worst Tory campaigns in recent elections.
