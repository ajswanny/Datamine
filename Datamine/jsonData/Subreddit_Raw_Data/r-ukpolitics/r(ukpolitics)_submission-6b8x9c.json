    "body": "What's sad about all this is the time at which this has happened. We are at a tipping point for the NHS with May getting ready to sell off large chunks of it to private healthcare companies in the US - in exchange for better post berixt trade deals.\n\nNow this forms another piece of ammunition to back it up, this wouldn't have happened in a privatised service etc.\n\nThe US has a terrible healthcare system. Check out the US rate of infant mortality, this yardstick of healthcare provision is way higher than most other developed nations including our own. Yet their healthcare system costs OVER DOUBLE what ours does per capita. Yeah you read that right, more than double.\n\nThe reason why is easy, with a privatised system it is geared to make profit. So more money leaves the system and goes into the pockets of private individuals.\n\nYet this is where we will be farming out our healthcare to and the system we will be emulating. All to line the pockets of greedy people. There are few more pertinent examples in modern British politics of the trading of the lives of the many for the wealth of the few.\n\nIn a generations time, which would you rather have? That a slightly better, but now irrelevant, trade deal was secured 20 years ago and a US style healthcare system OR a free and fair NHS and that trade deal wasn't quite as good, not that it really matters as we don't trade enough with the US for it to actually be a big deal.\n\nGetting a slightly worse trade deal with them will make absolutely no difference to your day to day life, getting a better deal in exchange for chunks of the NHS will have a massive effect for generations to come.\n\n\nSorry, rant over. I think this is just me being sad and anrgy at what's inevitably going to happen :( If I'm wrong on any of this I would be very glad to be corrected. As right now feel very disillusioned with it all.",

    "body": "The part about US Healthcare that would catch the UK by surprise is the extra work that's created around managing all the various permutations of health care.\n\nFor starters there's getting the insurance. My company offers 3 different permutations of coverage through the same provider. The coverages come with relatively high deductibles, moderate monthly premiums, and only cover a percentage of the cost of procedures. Of course this is dependant on you using a medical provider that partners with your health insurance, otherwise there's another deductible to use up with different (lower) percentages of procedures being covered.\n\nTo help amortize the cost they also offer accounts that people can put money into a separate account for medical expenses which isn't subject to some of the usual taxes. These come in two varieties. An FSA covers a broad spectrum of medical expenses, but if you don't use the money you put into the account, you lose it at the end of the year. An HSA is an account which has the same reduced-tax benefits, covers a more limited scope of medical expenses but doesn't expire at the end of the year.\n\nOn top of that companies can offer health programs to their employees to reduce the cost. For instance if I were to fill out an online diary of my families eating habits I could earn extra income in to the medical insurance FSA/HSA account.\n\nHowever because my wife works for a government institution I use her insurance (many more options with better coverage, no FSA/HSA/online survey bullshit) and say \"fuck that\" to our companies offerings.",

But a bed bound person requires much more support than a regular old person, both in the form of more visits (can't get own food, empty catheter etc) and more health problems (lack of basic exercise, bedsores, infection).

There is a cost in making yourself visible above the opposition, there is a cost in sales, there is a cost in procurement. For competition to actually improve efficiency it needs to reduce costs by more than all these additional costs.\n\nIn the case of US healthcare, 40% of the budget for big pharmaceutical companies is in marketing. That is such a big additional cost that it is practically impossible to recover elsewhere. They all spend horrendous amounts of money fighting over customers. Then pass the cost of that fight back onto customers. Drugs prices are lower in most of the world because marketing to this degree is just banned.",

The NHS is somewhat of an outlier when it comes to healthcare systems, in that about 90% of it is state-controlled. People immediately jump to a US-based model at the first mention of privatisation, which to be frank is an utter clusterfuck and I don't think even the Tories want that.\n\nBut moving away from an entirely state-owned healthcare service is not the evil it is made out to be, particularly when you consider that many of the top healthcare systems in the world are a mix of publicly and privately financed.\n\nI don't particularly approve of the way the creeping privatisation of the NHS has been implemented however, particularly because private care providers are not really held to account when things go tits up, and the NHS has to step back in to save the day (at great expense).",

Paracetamol is 92p for 32. That's what the pharmacy gets paid back, regardless of how much they bought the pack for. \n\nSo the actual drug is usually pretty cheap.

The frontline workers for both don't give a shit about budgets or money. The focus is all on patients.\n\nThe main difference is with management. In the public sector (NHS anyway) the managers are almost entirely focused on patients. That most of them have come from management instead of clinical work means they are misdirected sometimes but in the meetings I've been in all the managers talk about is patients and patient care with no mention of budgets or money. In the private sector the focus is on money. Not making tons of it or pushing for profit, but being tight to budgets at all costs. Managers are slammed so much harder for.p not hitting budgets in the private sector that it becomes the main aim as that's the measure of how good they are doing their job.\n\nIdeally something in the middle would be best, the financial responsibility of NHS middle management is laughable but it's nice to sit in meetings and talk about what's best for patients for the whole meeting rather than for 40% then focus on budgets (for me anyway)",

The same can be said of smoking, yet we don't advocate smoking anymore.  Over consumption of sugary food and drinks, including alchoholic drinks is the primary cause of Type 2.  People with smoking to lower their chance of cancer, are advised either to not smoke or cut down significantly. People making choices with what they consume should think more. It's a long term issue that requires long term solutions through education and waking people up to the realities. I know someone who was told, when they got type 2, that they could still eat what they wanted and just adjust their insulin. I was outraged for them and for others.  \n\nThe issue of reversing the condition is a big one, but one I believe in, as people have done it.  Simply by adopting a stricter diet and more exercise would lead to them not having to use the NHS as frequently, which would save money in more immediate times.  \n\nEvery diabetic is going to possibly require more and more care as they age. I can't see the current funding model for the NHS sustaining this in 10, 20, certainly not 30 years. More cash is a short term bandage.  Perhaps an independent body needs to take control of various aspects of the NHS. Politicians and governments really have a short time frame to create sustainable results with any policy. An independent body would be able to carry on big changes as governments come and go.  ",

Some of these drugs just require gps to monitor your blood levels every 3 months.\n\nAnd the bigger point is the meddling done by people who feel they need their viewpoint validated. One of the few private clinics capable of handling transgender people is currently being given the run through because a busy body doctor who everyone hates is making it his personal mission to make sure everyone accepts his view. They've been cleared of faults but due to regulation still have to wait a period of time before they continue operations as normal. This is extremely distressing for their patients.\n\n> I know, so vote labour, thats the only way the NHS will get funding\n\nI'll probably vote libdem personally since I'm in a libdem stronghold and in the current election it's safer to protect current seats that aren't tory.",
