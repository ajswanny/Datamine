Which, is a dubious justification, considering that pretty much all utilities and services that are regional monopolies are pretty heavily regulated. Like, we don't charge you more for electricity that charges your phone then we would for electricity that turns on a light of a certain brand. \n\nSomething I've been thinking about though, is what's to stop the Federal Trade Commission from coming in and destroying these ISPs after the FCC deregulates the internet? Unfairness and deception towards consumers represent two distinct areas of FTC enforcement and authority. The FTC also has authority over unfair methods of competition between businesses. \n\nOr even State laws? The FCC doesn't preempt State consumer protection laws, so they can't do anything about stopping States from making such laws. ",

Everything was handed to them. And they took it all: sex, drugs, and rock and roll, and they stayed loaded for 20 years and had a free ride. But now they're staring down the barrel of middle-age burnout, and they don't like it. So they've turned self-righteous. They want to make things harder on younger people. They tell 'em, abstain from sex, say no to drugs; as for the rock and roll, they sold that for television commercials a long time ago...so they could buy pasta machines and stairmasters and\u00a0soybean futures! They're cold, bloodless people. It's in their slogans, it's in their rhetoric: \"No pain, no gain.\" \"Just do it.\" \"Life is short, play hard.\" \"Shit happens, Deal with it.\" \"Get a life.\" These people went from 'do your own thing' to 'just say No'. They went from 'love is all you need' to 'whoever winds up with the most toys wins'. And they went from cocaine to Rogaine. And you know something, they're still counting grams, only now it's fat grams. And the worst of it is, the rest of us have to watch these commercials on TV for Levi's loose-fitting jeans and fat-ass Docker pants, because these degenerate yuppie Boomer cocksuckers couldn't keep their hands off the croissants and the Haagen-Dazs, and their big fat asses have spread all over and they have to wear fat-ass Docker pants.

    "body": "My understanding is that, when it was passing during the Obama administration, Republicans *put* Obama's name on it, calling it \"Obamacare\" so they could more easily vilify it among their base (because they couldn't allow anything to be accomplished during his administration). I've seen interviews where journalists are talking to conservative voters about the repeal of \"Obamacare\" and when they refer to it as the AHA, the voters think it is a different piece of legislation and they're in support of AHA. When the journalist tells them it is the same thing, there is a real look of horror on their faces as they realize that they're about to lose the cancer treatment coverage their husband is relying on to live. I don't know what they hell they thought Obamacare was, if not the AHA provisions, and I'm pretty sure they didn't know either, other than it was passed by that black Muslim terrorist.",
