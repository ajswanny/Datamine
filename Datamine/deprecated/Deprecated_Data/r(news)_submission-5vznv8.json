(Overall, reporters have had fewer chances to ask questions than any White House press corps since Ronald Reagan\u2019s.)...\nFox News, though it has a reach that far outstrips its competitors and sometimes rivals the broadcast networks, was in ninth place on the list, having been called on 14 times...NBC\u2019s Chuck Todd and ABC\u2019s Jake Tapper (now at CNN) were called on the most of any reporters \u2014 they each got 23 chances to question Obama.\"\nhttp://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/01/17/obama-fox-news-press-conferences_n_2495440.html\n\"Mr. Axelrod said it was the view of the White House that Fox News had blurred the line between news and anti-Obama advocacy...By the following weekend, officials at the White House had decided that if anything, it was time to take the relationship to an even more confrontational level.\nThe spur: Executives at other news organizations, including The New York Times, had publicly said that their newsrooms had not been fast enough in following stories that Fox News, to the administration\u2019s chagrin, had been heavily covering through the summer and early fall \u2014 namely, past statements and affiliations of the White House adviser Van Jones that ultimately led to his resignation and questions surrounding the community activist group Acorn...\nThose reports included a critical segment on the schools safety official Kevin Jennings, with the on-screen headline \u201cSchool Czar\u2019s Past May Be Too Radical\u201d; urgent news coverage of a video showing schoolchildren \u201csinging the praises, quite literally, of the president,\u201d which the Fox News contributor Tucker Carlson later called \u201cpure Khmer Rouge stuff\u201d...There followed, beginning in earnest more than two weeks ago, an intensified volley of White House comments describing Fox as \u201cnot a news network.\u201d...\nThen, in an interview with NBC News on Wednesday, the president went public. \u201cWhat our advisers have simply said is that we are going to take media as it comes,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if media is operating, basically, as a talk radio format, then that\u2019s one thing. And if it\u2019s operating as a news outlet, then that\u2019s another.\u201d...\u201cWe simply decided to stop abiding by the fiction, which is aided and abetted by the mainstream press, that Fox is a traditional news organization,\u201d said Dan Pfeiffer, the deputy White House communications director.\"\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/23/us/politics/23fox.html",

Please keep in mind that I'm a dumbass teenager, I openly admit that I don't know everything.\n\nIn all fairness, the scenario below is not *100%* what we're dealing with right now. But we are on a slippery goddamn slope.\n\nImagine this statement: \"Suzie ate an apple.\" Let's pretend that Suzie is a controversial figure in the public eye. What I just wrote was the truth, and for whatever reason, this was incredibly important info for the public to know. The president was going to have a press release to reveal this info.\n\nImagine Press Group A. PG A wants to report the facts, and also spin this info in Suzie's favor. They would report \"Suzie eats apple, throws benefit for the poor.\" (This is a true statement).\n\n PG A has intentionally worded their news to make Suzie look better, and bolster the Pro-Suzie side of the argument.\n\nImagine Press Group B. PG B wants to report the facts only. They would report \"Suzie eats apple\". \n\nPG B did not spin this info either way, supports neither side. \n\nImagine Press Group C. PG C wants to report the facts, and also spin this against Suzie. They would report \"Suzie eats apple, spends 100k on private estate.\" (This is a true statement) \n\nPG C has intentionally worded their news to make Suzie look worse, and bolster the Anti-Suzie side of the argument.\n\nImagine Press Group D. PG D wants to *dystroy* Suzie. They're looking for a fight, not a conversation. They don't really care about \"facts\"- if they can get people to believe it, they'll print it. They would report \"Suzie throws apple at homeless man, spends 100k on kicking puppies\" (This is an outright lie- the only truth in their statement is that Suzie at one point was holding an apple. )\n\nPG D has intentionally written sensationalist nonsense in order to dupe and rile up people against Suzie.  They did not show the parts of the truth that suited them- rather, they invented a new truth that suited them. This is what's known as alternative facts, or as it's more commonly recognized, pure bullshit. \n\nNow, the President is the one releasing this info. Say the President strongly supports/ is in the pockets of /would greatly benefit from supporting PG D, and what they stand for. And so, when holding this press conference, he only allows PG D inside.\n\nNow, and here's the really important part, so pay attention:\n \n**The only image that we, the citizens, get to see of Suzie is the one the President agrees with.**\n\nThis is no longer a matter of supporting or not supporting a controversial ideal. This is a deliberate manipulation of the 'truths' released to the public, and is a disservice to every American citizen, reguardless if they agree with the topic or disagree with the topic at hand. The President should not get to decide what version of the truth the people get to see. They should not get to censor the argument by only allowing the people they agree with to report on it, end of story. \n\nThis is a disgrace.\n\nEdit: added to the top",

    "body": "Fourteen Defining Characteristics Of Fascism By Dr. Lawrence Britt Source Free Inquiry.co 5-28-3\n\nDr. Lawrence Britt has examined the fascist regimes of Hitler (Germany), Mussolini (Italy), Franco (Spain), Suharto (Indonesia) and several Latin American regimes. Britt found 14 defining characteristics common to each:.....and now trump lol\n\n 1. Powerful and Continuing Nationalism - Fascist regimes tend to make constant use of patriotic mottos, slogans, symbols, songs, and other paraphernalia. Flags are seen everywhere, as are flag symbols on clothing and in public displays.\n\n 2. Disdain for the Recognition of Human Rights - Because of fear of enemies and the need for security, the people in fascist regimes are persuaded that human rights can be ignored in certain cases because of \"need.\" The people tend to look the other way or even approve of torture, summary executions, assassinations, long incarcerations of prisoners, etc.\n\n 3. Identification of Enemies/Scapegoats as a Unifying Cause - The people are rallied into a unifying patriotic frenzy over the need to eliminate a perceived common threat or foe: racial , ethnic or religious minorities; liberals; communists; socialists, terrorists, etc.\n\n 4. Supremacy of the Military - Even when there are widespread domestic problems, the military is given a disproportionate amount of government funding, and the domestic agenda is neglected. Soldiers and military service are glamorized.\n\n 5. Rampant Sexism - The governments of fascist nations tend to be almost exclusively male-dominated. Under fascist regimes, traditional gender roles are made more rigid. Divorce, abortion and homosexuality are suppressed and the state is represented as the ultimate guardian of the family institution.\n\n 6. Controlled Mass Media - Sometimes to media is directly controlled by the government, but in other cases, the media is indirectly controlled by government regulation, or sympathetic media spokespeople and executives. Censorship, especially in war time, is very common.\n\n 7. Obsession with National Security - Fear is used as a motivational tool by the government over the masses.\n\n 8. Religion and Government are Intertwined - Governments in fascist nations tend to use the most common religion in the nation as a tool to manipulate public opinion. Religious rhetoric and terminology is common from government leaders, even when the major tenets of the religion are diametrically opposed to the government's policies or actions.\n\n 9. Corporate Power is Protected - The industrial and business aristocracy of a fascist nation often are the ones who put the government leaders into power, creating a mutually beneficial business/government relationship and power elite.\n\n 10. Labor Power is Suppressed - Because the organizing power of labor is the only real threat to a fascist government, labor unions are either eliminated entirely, or are severely suppressed.\n\n 11. Disdain for Intellectuals and the Arts - Fascist nations tend to promote and tolerate open hostility to higher education, and academia. It is not uncommon for professors and other academics to be censored or even arrested. Free expression in the arts and letters is openly attacked.\n\n 12. Obsession with Crime and Punishment - Under fascist regimes, the police are given almost limitless power to enforce laws. The people are often willing to overlook police abuses and even forego civil liberties in the name of patriotism. There is often a national police force with virtually unlimited power in fascist nations.\n\n 13. Rampant Cronyism and Corruption - Fascist regimes almost always are governed by groups of friends and associates who appoint each other to government positions and use governmental power and authority to protect their friends from accountability. It is not uncommon in fascist regimes for national resources and even treasures to be appropriated or even outright stolen by government leaders.\n\n 14. Fraudulent Elections - Sometimes elections in fascist nations are a complete sham. Other times elections are manipulated by smear campaigns against or even assassination of opposition candidates, use of legislation to control voting numbers or political district boundaries, and manipulation of the media. Fascist nations also typically use their judiciaries to manipulate or control election \n\n",

Now the government has tanks, drones, invisibility suits, robot soldiers, bombers, nukes, fighter jets, warships, satellites, microwave guns, etc. Thanks to the same people who fear our government voting for politicians who make government too militarily powerful.

Everyone is (for now), and should be, allowed to write whatever they want regardless of if someone likes it or not.

Its something that can get out of hand quickly, in either direction, and isn't very American to me regardless of stance. This is not a party issue at all because neither side should be doing that.\n\nWe have video cameras everywhere now, things can't be just written down and changed and we don't trust things we haven't seen with our own eyes, regardless of how its interpreted, so when someone isn't allowed to show exactly what happened, that isn't cool.",

It takes the rest of the country by surprise every time, to discover that a lot of their countrymen not only have very regressive ideas about leadership, but actively cheer when critical democratic structures are dismantled piece by piece.\n\nIn both Russia and Turkey, as their respective leaders have slowly trimmed away democracy, there have been huge amounts of support from devoted fans.\n\nIt really seems there is a particular type of personality who just can't resist a strong, brutal leader. They desperately *want* to be led like children. And if the people being oppressed as a result are the people they don't like... all the better.\n\nSo here we have Trump's fanbase having wet dreams because of all the 'liberal tears' this election created. Seeing the LGBTQs, blacks, mexicans, pot smokers, and atheists getting shafted is like a gift from heaven for these people.\n\nThe fact America is destroyed in the process is of no concern to them at all.",

The Obama administration did cut Fox News out of a treasury department interview.  Fox News, and the other mainstream media outlets, complained and the issue was fixed immediately, Fox News got the interview, and the Obama White House issued Fox an apology.  The original event shouldn't have happened, but it was corrected and the WH took responsibility for it.\n\nThe current situation is entirely different here.  The WH is not backing down on this and no apologies were afforded.  Good on Fox News for joining the others in complaining about this after the other media outlets did it for them.  Anyway, it's too late now for the media outlets to get their access - the event is done and over with.\n\nComparisons to the 2009 event stop at the White House.  In 2009, it was a treasury department employee that had a partisan belief lead them to a poor decision.  As soon as it got raised to the White House, it was resolved.  Here, though, the issue originated with the White House at a very high level.\n\nI still think it's fair to mention that Fox News was targeted in 2009 by the administration but that's about as far as the comparisons can go.  The significance and the severity of today's event eclipses what happened in 2009.",

Trump's election was very scary, but at least it was a wakeup call that our generation's idealism doesn't always match up with the reality that there are plenty of bigoted, hateful people out there. I hope that this wakeup call encourages young Americans like you to ensure that someone like him is never elected again, encourages young Canadians like me to ensure that his bigotry does not spread north, and encourages young people around the world to continue fighting for social progress. Specifically in regards to Western countries, the past few decades have seen huge leaps in social progress. Just a few decades ago, racial segregation was still a reality in the US, women were still hugely marginalized in every country, homophobia was rampant, and trans people were not even talked about. In just a few short generations, though there is a *long* way to ago, consider the progress that humanity has made. Trump is temporary. The effects that our generation will have will be far longer lasting.\n\nI'm not trying to dismiss your concerns. I can't imagine how scary it must be living as a trans person in Trump's America, and I can't pretend to understand that fear.

Fucking hell, your press secretary was out there *2 weeks ago* chastisting reporters for calling it a ban, and now *you're fucking calling it a ban*.\n\n5. At any time, a new executive order could have been issued dealing with all the issues the appeals court recognized in upholding the stay, and this would allow you to execute the new clarified EO in a way that wouldn't result in judicial intervention, but you're ego is simple so fragile that you now are in a \"fight\" with the judiciary over this and refuse to take the logical course of action if you want the actions in effect.\n\nNo, Mr. President, the ban has been a fucking shit show, and the judiciary is but one cog in the overal excrement inducing machine that is your embarrassment of an EO rollout, you stupid fuck.\n\nDo trump supporters *even have a fucking pulse?* Who in the FUCK is this guy fooling anymore?",
