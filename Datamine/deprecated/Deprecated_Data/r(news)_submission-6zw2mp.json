Essentially, the exemptions are in there because they are things already regulated at the shelter level, and you only get the exemptions if you are getting your animals from one of these shelters.

What had caused the fire was a cage the new born puppies was in, had a heating lamp (around January) well the heating lamp caught on fire. Burned a whole litter of puppies to death before the house caught on fire. Only damage to the house was a burned up kitchen. First thing the owners wanted to know was if insurance was gonna pay them for the dead puppies because that was \"$10K that caught on fire\" thankfully the dogs used for breeding were in separate cages. They got to watch their babies burn, but at least they didnt.... \nSo think twice before buying puppies from assholes that only care about how much $ they can get for em. ",

All these statistics come from a massive new project on life expectancy and inequality that was just published in the Journal of the American Medical Association.\n>\n>\"The strongest pattern in the data was that low-income individuals tend to live longest (and have more healthful behaviors) in cities with highly educated populations, high incomes, and high levels of government expenditures, such as New York, New York, and San Francisco, California,\" the authors write.\n>\n>Harvard's David Cutler, a co-author on the study, guesses it's some mix of these. \"It's some combination of formal public policies and the effect that comes when you're around fewer people who have behaviors like smoking, and therefore you smoke less,\" he told my colleague Julia Belluz.\n>\n>California, for instance, has been a national leader on smoking bans, and New York led the way on cutting trans fats. Perhaps there's more funding for public services in these cities, though it's hard to say which public services would be leading to these gains in low-income life expectancy.\n\nhttp://www.vox.com/2016/4/13/11420230/life-expectancy-income\n\n>Meanwhile, life-saving practices that have become widely accepted in other affluent countries \u2014 and in a few states, notably California \u2014 have yet to take hold in many American hospitals.\n>\n>As the maternal death rate has mounted around the U.S., a small cadre of reformers has mobilized. Some of the earliest and most important work has come in California, where more babies are born than in any other state \u2014500,000 a year, one-eighth of the U.S. total.\n>\n>Modeled on the U.K. process, the California Maternal Quality Care Collaborative is informed by the experiences of founder Elliott Main, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Stanford and the University of California-San Francisco, who for many years ran the ob/gyn department at a San Francisco hospital.\n>\n>Launched a decade ago, CMQCC aims to reduce not only mortality, but also life-threatening complications and racial disparities in obstetric care. It began by analyzing maternal deaths in the state over several years; in almost every case, it discovered, there was \"at least some chance to alter the outcome.\" The most preventable deaths were from hemorrhage (70 percent) and preeclampsia (60 percent).\n>\n>Hospitals that adopted the toolkit saw a 21 percent decrease in near deaths from maternal bleeding in the first year; hospitals that didn't use the protocol had a 1.2 percent reduction. By 2013, according to Main, maternal deaths in California fell to around 7 per 100,000 births, similar to the numbers in Canada, France and the Netherlands \u2014 a dramatic counter to the trends in other parts of the U.S.\n\nhttp://www.npr.org/2017/05/12/527806002/focus-on-infants-during-childbirth-leaves-u-s-moms-in-danger\n\n>Collectively, the colleges, institutions, and alumni of the University of California make it the most comprehensive and advanced postsecondary educational system **in the world**, responsible for nearly $50 billion per year of economic impact.[4] UC campuses have large numbers of distinguished faculty in almost every academic discipline, with UC faculty and researchers having won **62 Nobel Prizes as of 2016.[5] UC campuses are perennially ranked highly** by various publications. Most notably, 6 UC campuses rank in the top 50 U.S. National Universities of 2017 by U.S. News & World Report. Internationally, UC Berkeley, UCLA, and UC San Diego are respectively ranked 3rd, 12th, and 14th worldwide by Academic Ranking of World Universities.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California\n\nWhile doing this, California also powers the US economy:\n\n>California is the chief reason America is the only developed economy to achieve record GDP growth since the financial crisis. Much of the U.S. growth can be traced to California laws promoting clean energy, government accountability and protections for undocumented people\n\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-05-10/california-leads-u-s-economy-away-from-trump\n\nAlso while [California's energy efficiency initiatives are so successful that it manages to use the same electricity as decades ago, even with more people and more electronics, whereas the US has steadily risen in energy consumption](https://www.nrdc.org/sites/default/files/ca-success-story-FS.pdf)\n\nYet the American South receives subsidies from California dwarfing complaints in the EU (the subsidy and economic difference between California and Mississippi is larger than between Germany and Greece!), which act as a transfer of wealth from blue states/cities/urban to red states/rural/suburban with blue states' federal dollars for everything from their freeways to hospitals to universities to airports to environmental protection:\n\n\"2016\u2019s Most & Least Federally Dependent States\"\n\n\"Freeloaders\": Top 5 \"Takers\" of receiving federal funds vs giving federal contributions:\n\n>1 Mississippi\n>\n>2 New Mexico\n>\n>3 Alabama\n>\n>4 Louisiana\n>\n>5 Tennessee\n\n\"Givers\": Top 5 givers federal contributions vs receiving federal funds:\n\n>46 California\n>\n>47 Kansas\n>\n>48 New Jersey\n>\n>49 Connecticut\n>\n>50 Delaware\n\nhttps://wallethub.com/edu/states-most-least-dependent-on-the-federal-government/2700/\n\nhttp://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/05/which-states-are-givers-and-which-are-takers/361668/\n\nRelated:\n\n>Here's the vote for Hurricane Sandy aid. 179 of the 180 no votes were Republicans.\n\n>I count at least 20 Texas Republicans.\n\nhttp://clerk.house.gov/evs/2013/roll023.xml, https://twitter.com/MEPFuller/status/901871687532208128\n\nEven to prevent gerrymandering, California has a scientific, \"evidence based\" independent commission that has to take into account geography, community boundaries, etc.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Citizens_Redistricting_Commission",

    "body": "There are proper ways to take care of parrots but it requires a lot of maintenance; especially for the bigger ones. They are social animals and require a lot of bonding, whether with another bird or their owner. They are also very playful and desire a lot of stimulation which can come from either just scratching and petting and close body contact to many toys and a lot of room to fly. It just kind of depends on the bird and species. For instance I've seen some cockatoos that are very energetic and require a lot of stimulation from places to perch and fly around to toys to play with and destroy. And then I've seen some [golden macaws](https://www.reddit.com/r/parrots/comments/5o68bn/everybody_meet_riley_met_her_last_week_at/) that are so well behaved and content enough with being around the owner for affection that they can just roam outside with said owner without a leash or harness.\n\n\nOverall parrots and birds are animals that require a lot of time, care, and affection for if you want them to live happy healthy lives. It can depend on the bird species as some are more manageable than others. The biggest factor in owning a bird will always be the social aspect though as without that social aspect birds have been and can turn aggressive or depressive if they are separated from their owner or close bird friends for a while (It's not like a dog where they think if you are gone for a few hours it's the end of a world. it's more like a gradual process over the course of days, weeks, and months). But trust me, I honestly feel like birds are some of the most rewarding pets to have if you know what you are doing. Dogs are great, cats can cuddle, sneks can boop, and fish...fish...but something about birds and parrots to me is just so much better than the others.",

When I adopted my guy I had to do a certain number of volunteer hours at the rescue (so worth it, and a really brilliant requirement), they did multiple interviews and at least two home visits and I spent a lot of time interacting with the birds under supervision to make sure that the bird and I were good matches for each other.",

Frequently with a gun or other cheap method. Sometimes rescues buy the dogs from the auctions. The mill owners don't care who buys the dogs, it's all money in their pockets so they don't discourage rescues from buying the animals. In fact, rescue bidding against other mill operators drives the price of the dog up so the mills sometimes actually start breeding for rescue. \n\nIf the USDA shuts down a mill the dogs are confiscated and taken in by various animal welfare groups. Sometimes shelters, sometimes rescue, sometimes both. It's a huge burden for the groups dealing with the influx of dogs because they are all in very poor health and frequently they've never been handled except harshly. They are sometimes very difficult to bring around and getting them to a place where they can be a family member instead of a terrorized and terrified creature can take years. \n\nIt's heartbreaking but the breeding stock in a mill look more like gargoyles than like dogs.

Case and point, while my rabbit was in her cage (which was just used as a litter box with one side permanently open) I offered her a treat. Rather than exit the cage and go around, she would smash her face through the wire and attempt to eat the treat. Even if she could reach the treat, she couldn't actually eat it, since she would have her mouth wrapped around the metal frame of the cage.\n\nTL;DR: rabbits are wonderful loving pets with distinct personalities, but intelligent is one of the last words I would use to describe them.",

It only took about two months of casual browsing and contemplation before I stumbled upon the perfect little pair of kitties.\n\nI understand some people are really into certain breeds and want X breed from Y breeder, but I also think it definitely makes sense to browse shelters first, and many people don't realize what kind of amazing selection you can get from rescues.\n\nEvery organization I contacted when I tried to adopt asked me my preference in breed, eye color, coat color, etc and matched me with relatively suitable animals.  It's truly amazing what sort of creatures you can find on rescue sites.\n\nAdopting from these shelters is like the perfect combination of \"common sense\" and \"moral sense.\"\n",

Giving them to us is cheaper than buying bullets and disposing of bodies), transporting dogs across the country, donations for vet care, raising funds, providing hospice care, sewing coats (they frequently have very poor coats when they come from a mill), fighting legal battles, lobbying, and a million other everyday tasks involved with rescue.

It seems like a horrible cycle.\n\nI suspect that may be endemic across the board. We used to run into it with reptile importers in the 80's. If your animals are sickly, some people will buy or adopt them just to try to save them. Goodness knows I did - over and over and over. (Six rescue iguanas, four rescue monitors, and a changing assortment of snakes and geckos made college life in a studio apartment ... interesting.) But saving an individual sickly animal is still money in the importer's pocket. \n\nDeliberate, careful captive breeding of the expensive species by serious and knowledgeable reptile people who wanted a smaller population of healthy animals - often so they could sell them to other serious and knowledgeable herpephiles for exorbitant rates, but there you are -\n helped to stop some of this cycle. \n\nBut for animals like iguanas and Savannah monitors ... Well, the last time I looked I had to stop looking or we would have ended up with a house carpeted in abandoned reptiles ... again. I can't even go to the expos any more. ",

    "body": "The answer to this is really nuanced because sometimes you will hear people excuse buying a mill dog from a pet shop as 'saving' it. And they are, but the issue is that as long as the dogs can be sold legally, the puppy mills are going to keep operating regardless of what the end purchaser does. It costs most of these places almost no money to run the mills because they don't care about the dogs. The pet stores sell the puppies for a stupid high mark-up like $500, when it costs the mill maybe $15 through the lifetime of a bitch to take care of it. THey'd keep going even if the dogs sold for $30.\n\nWhen one end of the business is so unscrupulous, it doesn't matter what anyone else does. Buy, don't buy, send it to a shelter, they do not give a rats' butt.\n\nSo people and shelters are helping the mills but only because they want to help the dogs, and helping the dogs in that case is more important. The only way mills are actually going to be fully shut down is through legislation like in the OP. Not only does this prevent pet stores from buying the dogs, but it also gives animal welfare groups more leverage to start busting these operations and prosecuting the owners. There are some states that most mills operate out of that have almost no animal cruelty laws which is why they operate with no issues. We need to start making changes at the top, the legal level, so that it can reach the bottom and finally deprive the mills of the means to keep operating.\n\nSo yeah. If you want to help stop seeing lots of dogs in shelters, petition your state reps for laws like this. That's the only way we can cut off the head of the beast.",

It's why you don't get many benevolent dictators or even benevolent politicians. By promising what is right for *all*, those who want your power can just promise what you are giving to everyone to the select few who matter.\n\nIf they try to lobby both parties, they'll just get out bought by groups willing to side one way or the other instead of spreading their money too thin.\n\nif this was a mixture with a majority (say even 80-20 or 90-10) instead of the 99.5-.5 it is, I'd agree it's more likely a party issue and not a lobbying one (like food stamps, which had 33 for reduction, 13 against in the republican party). Simply put, both side take bribes and don't give a damn about the majority of what they vote on, only what they're paid to vote on it. I agree there are exceptions to this rule, but things like NN are not one of them. Now are there party characteristics that help *decide* which lobbyists lobby which party? Absolutely. Without a doubt it's easier for big business to lobby republicans than democrats, as a big business likely lobbies for the same stuff other big business is lobbying for (a sort of constructive interference in lobbying, vs contradicting lobbyists having destructive interference), but in the end, both side's aren't voting for their beliefs, but for the beliefs of the highest bidding group",

For what it's worth, I've lived outside of CA too and didn't find people elsewhere to be any more or less shallow.\n\nEven among liberals, CA politics (until recently) have generally been dismissed as crazy and not something to be taken seriously. Meanwhile, conservatives frequently refer to the state as a \"failed state\" despite the fact that it never \"failed\" and is doing extremely well economically. My personal favorite was when Rick Santorum claimed that UCLA is so anti-American that it doesn't offer a single American history class; I had to take two as a graduation requirement.\n\nFrom what I hear, people in Oregon and Washington are quite open about their hatred of Californians, since so many are moving to find better real estate prices. At least that almost makes sense, although I don't understand extending the hatred to Californians who haven't moved north.\n\nJust in general, I hear/see far more negative references to California than positive ones, and most of those positive statements come from Californians.

If they can't, assume the pet hasn't had anything done for it. If you're told it's been given some 5-in-1 shot from a farmers market, that doesn't count.\n\n As an aside, always double check with your vet on any special instructions breeders might give you for you pet. The amount of harmlessly asinine instructions at best, or potentially fatal instructions at worse, that clinics sometimes see handed to new owners is ridiculous.\n\nDisclaimer: I'm not saying all breeders are just in it for a quick buck while they abuse their stock and give bad advice. I just want people to be aware of how many bad small and large businesses are out there in the pet market that will take advantage of you the moment you let your guard down. ",

Look at Hawaii's fisheries for example (which were just shut down, unfortunately, despite being one of the best regulated marine fisheries in the world). They had great sustainability and high survival rates. There are also other areas where the locals set up conservation on their own. Unfortunately there are also many areas that are treated poorly and have low survival rates and sustainability. But look at freshwater fish, (and bangaii cardinalfish). Many of them nearly went extinct until hobbyists learned how to breed them, and then the wild populations began thriving and conservation was much easier because hobbyists helped scientist learn how to support their populations and even replenish them. There are also species that have gone extinct in the wild due to development or pollution that live on in the hobby. Captive breeding represents the possibility of long term preservation in the face of an uncertain future. If the ocean turns too acidic to support coral I guarantee you xenia, mushrooms, millipora and many many more types of coral will live on and might even repopulate the ocean some day. ",

It's meant to be introductory to the concept of the \"why\" to \"why do rulers do what they do?\"\n\nAs far as the book in question (and the theory along with it), they're not too surprisingly well received by academia. The major arguments people tend to rouse against the book is its lack of sight into the psychological and idealistic causes behind actions, and yet the theory itself is still widely accepted as a reasonable explanation for how it all works in spite of the book's flaws (yet it still manages to consistently pull solid 4+/5 when reviewed).\n\nIs it perfect? Not necessarily. There are always outliers, more dumb and loyal in a court than the smart (as CGP grey labeled those general groups), and so the theory has its exceptions, but no theory of power all encompassing.\n\nI usually use CGP's video as an explanation on the theory for his ability to introduce the subject so well. His use of abstractions is up for debate on how excessive they might have been (I can see how a few real life examples wouldn't hurt, as the book itself gives *plenty* of). I won't say its the be all end all, but it's made to explain (relatively) fast and maybe send some people down an informative rabbit hole.",
