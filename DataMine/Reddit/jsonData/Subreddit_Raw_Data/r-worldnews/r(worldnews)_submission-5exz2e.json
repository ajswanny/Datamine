But this is the creepy part...\n\nI swear, 1 hour ago, I was watching an old episode of Celebrity Deathmatch and he was in it as a ref or something. I said \"Is he still alive?\" and then looked up online real quick to see on Wikipedia. \"Yep, still alive, dude is 90. probably will live forever at this point.\"\n\nSeriously 1 hour later I find out he is dead.\n\nI am keeping my thoughts about people's well being to my self for now on.\"\n\nEdit: good morning, holy shit karma!!\n\nThere are a lot of comments of people having the same thing happen with him yesterday. Mr. Castro apparently had a lot of people thinking about him as he passed. I guess that would be  comforting, if you knew...",
