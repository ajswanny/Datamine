(Oldham is in Greater Manchester for non Brits)~~ - Most probably false.\n\nBBC reporting that the Police are treating it as a \"potential terrorist incident\". Again unconfirmed. \n\n\"This is a major incident targeted at our city. Our hearts go out to all & our gratitude to emergency services\" - MP Lucy Powell after talking to Manchester mayor Andy Burnham.\n\n[19 people confirmed dead](https://twitter.com/gmpolice/status/866808564316344321/photo/1)\n\nBloke on BBC is saying most of the victims are young girls.\n\nBBC 5Live reporting a second \"device\", police cordon has been widened and bomb disposal being sent in.\n\n[\"Device\" is being destroyed in controlled explosion.](https://twitter.com/gmpolice/status/866813662505447424?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redditmedia.com%2Fmediaembed%2Fliveupdate%2Fyz4k8674h837%2FLiveUpdate_4652e3e8-3f4f-11e7-8b04-0e7d320b6ec2%2F0)\n\nJust heard the controlled explosion on the news, it was very loud.\n\nEyewitness on BBC News reporting that there were \"nuts and bolts\" on the floor shortly after the explosion, potentially confirming reports of the device being a nail bomb.\n\nGreater Manchester Police (GMP) holding a press conference at 2AM according to BBC 5L\n\n[\"2nd Device\" was abandoned clothing GMP confirms](https://twitter.com/gmpolice/status/866816910612103169?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redditmedia.com%2Fmediaembed%2Fliveupdate%2Fyz4k8674h837%2FLiveUpdate_1c9da05e-3f51-11e7-b6c0-0e6315a0550e%2F0)\n\nReports from US officials that this was a suicide attack, not being corroborated by British sources yet so take with a grain of salt.\n\nIn the absence of any significant developments as we wait for the press conference, I'd like to highlight all the good people are doing in the wake of such a tragedy. Hotels are letting children stay there until they can find their parents/guardians, taxis are offering free rides, people are buying water bottles and handing them out to victims, members of local press are offering their phones to anyone needing to contact loved ones and googles of blood donation are skyrocketing. Even in such terrible circumstances it is amazing how people can come together for the good of those affected. \n\n[Emergency number for people looking for loved ones in the area](https://twitter.com/gmpolice/status/866837240026198016?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redditmedia.com%2Fmediaembed%2Fliveupdate%2Fyz4k8674h837%2FLiveUpdate_4fa570f2-3f5c-11e7-8225-0ec16227f358%2F0) - **0161 856 9400**\n\nNorthwest Ambulance reporting that they've taken 59 casualties to hospitals in addition to treating numerous walking wounded on site. \n\n[Latest statement from GMP](https://twitter.com/gmpolice/status/866841256059699200/photo/1?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redditmedia.com%2Fmediaembed%2Fliveupdate%2Fyz4k8674h837%2FLiveUpdate_7a9a7896-3f5e-11e7-b892-0e8e2d13bb90%2F0) \n\nI'm going off now, here's hoping that the death toll stays at 19 and that those injured make as full a recovery as they can. A big thank you to all the emergency services and all those who helped like the taxi driver on BBC News right now who drove up from Liverpool to give people free lifts, and my condolences to all those affected.",

I understand that there are many given variables in a terrorist attack, and that remaining calm is obviously important... but what is the best course of action to take in a situation like this? Stay put? Run? Hide? I just keep wondering what I would have done if I was there, not knowing what had happened, not knowing if it would happen again.... I'm not religious, but I find myself praying for these people tonight. More death fueled by hatred..... \n\nEdit: I feel like I would know what to do in most variations of a terrorist scenario on my own, or at least I would like to think I would... but my biggest fear is somethong like this happening while I am with loved ones... the more people, the more variables, the harder it is to keep everyone safe. I know it is highly unlikely for something like this to happen to me, but I still fear it... not because I might die, but worse, vbecause I might have to see people I know and care about die...\n\nMaybe I am thinking too hard about this.

She is absolutely heartbroken about what has happened. She feels so upset about the children who were injured/killed. She told me that the only thing seperating them from the suicide bomber was a wall and had her and her friends left before the encore they would have been blown up. She also said she feels some sort of guilt for making it out of there alive and unhurt. Hearing this from her made me break down, not just for her but for everyone who was affected.

They\u2019re a good pair too.\u201d\n\n>He told the Daily Record: \u201cI noticed a 4\u00d74 sitting in the middle of the road. Then, as my passenger was paying and getting out, the Jeep rammed into the airport entrance right next to us.\n\n>\u201cThen he kicked and punched a man to the ground before punching a policeman square in the face.\n\n>\u201cThat\u2019s when I saw red. That sort of thing just isn\u2019t on.\n\n>\u201cI told my passenger to run for her life, then I went for the passenger and managed to skelp him in the face. I followed it up by booting him twice.\u201d\nThe father of two damaged a tendon in his foot after he kicked one of the suspects.\n\n>The cabbie said: \u201cI kicked him with full force right in the balls but he didn\u2019t go down. He just kept on babbling his rubbish.\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t believe that he was still standing. I know I would have been floored by that kind of kick.\u201d\n\n>\u201cIt was obvious the driver wanted into the boot of the Jeep for something and I was worried about what it was. I thought it must be a gun.\"\n\n>\u201cHe was going crazy, just lashing out at everyone and babbling p*sh in a foreign language the whole time.\n\n>\u201cI\u2019ve heard people say since that he was shouting \u2018Allah!\u2019 but I didn\u2019t hear that. It just sounded like a lot of c**p to me.\n\n>\u201cI ran for the guy and punched him twice in the face with pretty good right hooks.\n\n>\u201cI don\u2019t think the policeman I saw at the scene drew his baton during the whole thing. He should have given it to me \u2013 I\u2019d have leathered those guys with it.\u201d",

Also this looks very similar to the injury pattern of the Boston bombing, I would not be surprised if the same type of explosive or containment was used.  I'd also be willing to bet this was a ground based explosive based on the injury pattern and highly doubt it was a suicide bombing. That means police are going to be looking for suspects.",
