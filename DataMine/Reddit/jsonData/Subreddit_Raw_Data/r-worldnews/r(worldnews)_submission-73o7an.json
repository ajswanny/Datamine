If it were to become independent, myself and my country would likely be seriously economically crippled because of this (as would Catalonia), and their would be serious social, economic etc. implications to both states. But you're right guys, because of an injustice that occurred, this should happen. I'm not saying that it's wrong to support the Catalonian independence but people should first study the implications of this happening and what it would mean for Spain, the EU etc. before immediately saying that it is the right move.\n\n\nEdit: I've been asked to outline some of the main issues that I believe would stem from this decision. I'm going to bed now but these 2 articles outline quite well some of the biggest economic implications:\n\n1: http://uk.businessinsider.com/catalonia-split-spain-economic-impact-ing-2017-9\n\n2: https://www.cnbc.com/2017/09/21/heres-how-bad-economically-a-spain-catalonia-split-could-really-be.html\n\nOverall, the general gist of this is that the main problem is that if other European nations (especially Spain) aren't willing to cooperate and offer help then the economic impact of this for Catalonia would be greater than Brexit. Judging by the Spanish government's actions today this is even more concerning now, especially in terms of Catalonia's EU membership. \n\nEdit 2: For fucks sake people I in NO WAY endorse the government's actions today and I agree that Catalan people should have a right to vote. The thing I do not agree with is the fact that people have made up their mind on a massive decision purely from the stupidity of the government and not the actual impacts of said decision.",

But if I lived in Madrid, or elsewhere, I\u2019d be deeply unhappy, if a region that is central to economy unilaterally declares independence and leaves me in a economy that becomes even worse. I am also deeply skeptical of Russian-bit support for this. As well as the fact it makes Europe weaker. So, similar to the UK, independence should only be voted on, if the rest of Spain is fine with it. \n\nHowever, if I lived in Catalonia, and saw this kind of response by the Spanish government, I would have voted for independence. What the central Dpanish government did today was disgusting and a disgrace against democratic rule. \n\nSo actually my response is confused. I have much more sympathy for independence than I did a week ago. The Madrid government has lost its legitimacy through their actions. While, I think the opinions o the rest of Spain should be considered. Madrid has treated Catalonia abominably today. ",

Even ignoring whether such a dismissal holds any moral grounds, which is highly doubtful from what I have seen so far, there is the issue of how much influence a single party will get over the courts for years to come.\n\nWith Hungary I sadly can't give you a direct example, but you should find information about it through google.

You can not expect Spain to ignore their own constitution and allow a part of their country to leave. The whole of Spain also has a say in it. The city of Los Angeles cannot create their own state just because they voted on it. Catalonia has a duty to the rest of Spain as Spain has a duty to Catalonia. The USA was able to win a war against Britain. That is why they did not need Britians approval. Catalonia can't just create their own rules and expect others to recognize them.

The United States is the third most populous nation and the largest economy in the world. The rich can't 'leave', you can't ignore the US economically because you are ignoring the largest economy in the world. You *have* to do business with the US. You want to fly overseas and hide your wealth somewhere else, and the US still wants some of that wealth - the US has the political capital to force wherever you moved to pressure you into paying, extradite you if necessary (unless it is a place without an extradition treaty), and your share will be paid. On top of that you will not be making the same wealth by ignoring the US - which will be doing just fine without you with new billionaires in the making now that you've left a major vacuum to be filled. \n\n\n\n_________________\n\n\nAmerica was a colony with no representation in Europe. The big thing with the American revolution wasn't just taxes (most of the taxes were removed before the time of the revolution anyways, including that tea tax) it was taxation without representation. The Americas didn't get a vote to go to war with the French, nor did they get a vote to pay for that war with taxes - the king and parliament just decided that would happen. That is what pushed America to push for more independence (and ultimately the revolution). \n\nA better parallel, and a more ironic one that you are missing is the US and its colonies (Guam, Samoa) as well as Puerto Rico and Washington DC (Moreso PR since it can't vote in the presidential election). DC and PR get no congressional representation and are still federally taxed, and PR doesn't even get to vote in the presidential election like DC citizens can. Guam and American Samoa's people aren't even American Citizens like Puerto Ricans are. ",

It also gets a lot of the GDP \"credit\" for any Spanish export that goes through its ports and airports, even if the goods didn't originate within Catalonia itself. This is a point that comes up a lot when economists are trying to explain the complexities of national economies; we tend to *account* for GDP in urban areas and major entry/exit points, but that doesn't necessarily mean that the wealth involved was actually *generated* there. (Example: California often gets the GDP credit for a shipment of, say, Iowa's pork to China, but nobody in Long Beach actually raised, slaughtered, or processed the pigs.)\n\nThe reality is that not every city or region in a country is going to be a major tourist draw, not every city or region is suited to hosting major airports or ports, and not every city or region can realistically become a knowledge center. The latter is the result of an incredibly complex interaction of geography, history, culture, economy, education, and movement, and has never been successfully accomplished by a state in isolation. Meaning -- Catalonia has benefited enormously from being able to pull talent, hard work, and capital from all over Spain, and anything that changed that would likely not work to Catalonia's benefit.",

It comes from yet another legendary place, the Seirra de la Plata, the Silver Mountains and home of the White King - think \"el Dorado\", but silver instead of gold.

Confederation was the joining of various colonies led by upper Canada and lower Canada under MacDonald and Cartier in order to centralize and give themselves better voice in the empire. half the other provinces didn't even join for years after. it was not about independence at all, they didn't even go independent instead simply autonomous we didn't even acquire full rights to change our constitution until Trudeau.\n\n\"In 1841, Upper and Lower Canada\u2013now known as Ontario and Quebec\u2013were made a single province by the Act of Union. In the 1860's, a movement for a greater Canadian federation grew out of the need for a common defense, the desire for a national railroad system, and the necessity of finding a solution to the problem of French and British conflict.\"\n\nthis was during the Fenian raids where bands of Irish-born ex-union soldiers where raiding and ransacking towns near the border in some strange strike against Britain\n\n\"When the Maritime provinces, which sought union among themselves, called a conference in 1864, delegates from the other provinces of Canada attended. Later in the year, another conference was held in Quebec, and in 1866 Canadian representatives traveled to London to meet with the British government.\"\n\nwe were later given the Hudson bay area to administrate as well as Prince Edward island with the understanding we would pay off its debts. something i dont actually think got done. we were even later over a half-century later given dominion over Newfoundland and Labrador due to costs of upkeep for the British government.\n\nleave it to an american to make Canadian history all about glorious revolution and rebellions against the British.",
