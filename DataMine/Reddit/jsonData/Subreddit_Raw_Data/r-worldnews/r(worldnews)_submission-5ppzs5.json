    "body": "I spent a lot of time writing this, and it doesn't appear to be showing up in the comments.  I'll try one more time as a top level comment - What the TPP actually does and why:\n\n\nI did a couple hours of research a few months ago.  The best I could come up with from neutral sources was what I put below.  Read all of the bullet points though, because I didn't neatly separate this list into pros and cons (if you even can).\n\n* It is an absurdly complicated subject, so take everything with a grain of salt.\n\n* It would be like NAFTA was for mexico <--> US / Canada, but with a few major differences.  \n\n* The first major difference, is that instead of targeting trade with Mexico, the point was to target trade with south east asia.\n\n* The second major difference was that NAFTA targeted manufacturing jobs (in return for cheaper goods).  TPP targeted service level jobs, and was very explicit in which industries for which countries.\n\n* For example, for the United States, jobs in nursing and retail work were specifically targeted and expected to be strongly adversely affected, in return for significantly expanded asian market penetration for things like American automotive exports and pharmaceuticals.\n\n* How could something like nursing be exported?  Well, that actually gets to the heart of the matter.  For the United States, the point of the TPP (and its sister acts) was to greatly, greatly strengthen and enforce IP law for south east asia, to match already existing IP and trade law in the US and Europe.\n\n* So whereas right now your bank probably hires American programmers, instead of programmers from Cambodia, for purely safety and enforcement reasons, that would change tomorrow.  And with the TPP, if you are a programmer, this would adversely affect you.  But nursing was specifically targeted, as bringing SE asia more in line with HIPAA guarantees would make it legally feasible to outsource more hospital overhead offshore.\n\n* This all means you could expect major offshoring of what are right now considered reputable and secure jobs in America, and for the act to be quite transformative for the economy.  In short, if your job isn't tied to the USA, and is easy to offshore, but hasn't been for logistic, legal or economic reasons, the TPP almost certainly changed the math involved with that equation (though of course it will be different for every job / industry).\n\n**Okay, so if America is trading away good jobs in entire industries, what does it get in return?**\n\n* Right now, if you are a large business that wants to get into Asian markets, you have two problems.  1) If you open in China, there's a good chance your designs will be eventually be stolen and given to a Chinese company, which the Chinese government will then later support at your expense.  And 2) The rest of SE asia has similar problems to varying degrees, and they all trade with China.\n\n* Additionally, right now Europe's economy is looking dead for the foreseeable future.  And since America isn't spending money jumpstarting our own economy, we're not likely to grow at a large rate any time soon either.\n\n* But asian economies are booming.  And as they do so, they are trading with each other, and making trade deals with each other that don't include us.  And that's a major disadvantage for America and Europe.\n\n* So the purpose of the TPP, from a western viewpoint, is to get SE asia into the same economic and legal framework as the western world, and open their markets to western companies.  \n\n* The second purpose of the TPP, is to get China to play ball too.  Right now, if we tell China to open their markets, and enforce western IP law, they'll laugh in our face (and do so).  We don't have the bartering chips for that deal.  But if the rest of SE asia is already doing so with the West, and builds their economies around such laws, then 15-20 years from now, it won't just be Europe / USA telling China to open their markets and enforce international IP law, it will be the vast majority of China's trading partners.  In short, it would be an economic coup d'etat for western powers, that would bring a _lot_ of money to large western companies and give Washington much more power in Asia.  If you are a citizen of the west, this is almost certainly a good thing.\n\n* So Obama and Clinton's bet, is that if we don't make a deal like the TPP, then Chinese (and by extension SE asian) companies are going to spring up as international competitors to American firms anyway.  And that increased competition represents lost profits that could otherwise have been made by western companies trading in China.  So by trading those jobs to outsourcing now, the US would be in a much more dominant position later, and it is worth the trade.\n\n**Okay, is that line of thinking valid?**\n\nYes and No.\n\n* If you are a CEO, or a powerful washington person.  Then yes, unequivocally.  The TPP means continued western and American worldwide economic hegemony and should be strongly fought for.  EU / USA firms cannot do business in China.  That's a major economic disadvantage for any western firm playing on that level.\n\n* For people who's jobs are not offshored, then yes, this is probably a good plan.  Just like NAFTA resulted in cheaper goods, TPP should result in cheaper services across the board.  \n\n* But if your job can be offshored (and the list of offshorable jobs the TPP will make cost effective to offshore is large), then it is more complicated.\n\n* If the USA had a real economic safety net, and put forward programs towards retraining and revitalizing areas specifically hit by offshoring and globalization, then you could vote for the TPP confidently.  This, for example is how the scandanavian countries handled integration into the EU, and overall there are very few cases of real economic hardship as the result of that integration.  Overall, it was a success story.\n\n* But after NAFTA, the USA implemented no such programs, whatsoever.  Economists at the time, believed them to be unnecessary.  The thinking was, that if free trade agreements resulted in more trade, which resulted in more jobs, then people who lost their jobs to outsourcing should have no difficulty finding new jobs in a free market.\n\n* The reality was that outsourcing resulted in chain effects whereby entire regions of the country lost all their good jobs, and the good jobs that remained moved to other US locations.  Combined with the fact that many people woke up one day to find that their entire career was no longer employable in their home country, meant that they simply could not find new work.  Add in again Greenspan's attempts to 'lower worker mobility to increase American labor competitiveness', and the end result is that today, in 2017, many families that lost their jobs due to nafta STILL are not employed.\n\nSo at the end of the day, you have to make a call.  Do you think that America will be like Scandanavia, and reinvest a portion of the profits reaped by greater access to Asian markets on economic growth, unemployment benefits, worker retraining and government programs?  Or do you think that America will call those things socialism, ignore the problem, and allow large companies to reap the economic rewards unmolested?\n\nPersonally, I fall into the second category, so I am very, very happy to see the TPP fail.  I think that given the second viewpoint, outsourcing service level jobs, in THIS economy, would be a death sentence for many, many people.  But that said, if you think that the first option is a possibility, then the TPP should be strongly supported.  And really, in an ideal world, if we could trust that America would take care of the people who would be harmed by the outsourcing, then we would want the TPP to pass, because increased trade and American competitiveness in the future is something that should be encouraged and worked towards.",

Step three is term limits for Congress and the House. Four is comprehensive immigration reform (I think a wall is a bit much). Then healthcare reform, i.e. only repeal Obamacare when a better plan is ready and open up interstate insurance.\n\nI say this knowing I'll probably be downvoted to Oblivion, but I firmly believe that he will do what he said. And if he doesn't I'll be the first to show my distaste in the voters booth in 2020.\n\nEdit: I'll expand on the wall. I've always looked at the wall in a metaphorical perspective. Fund law enforcement and beef up border patrol security and in effect, create a wall. If we did wind up building one that's ok too. As far as what I think is reasonable for immigration reform. Voter ID laws. Illegal to open bank accounts, get drivers licenses, insurance, or be on welfare if illegal.\n\nEdit 2: Hey thanks everyone for all the responses! I know my ideas aren't perfect and with my job (Coil Tubing operator in the oil and gas industry) I find it hard to take the time to sift through the BS. If y'all have some reputable reading material, even if it's a different viewpoint PM me and I'll try to read it when I get time. I'm on night shift and have to get ready for work, I'll try to get back with everyone when I can.\n\nEdit 3: And here comes the hate mail. Well we had a good run of talking before it turned ugly.

    "body": "I did a couple hours of research a few months ago.  The best I could come up with from neutral sources was what I put below.  Read all of the bullet points though, because I didn't neatly separate this list into pros and cons (if you even can).\n\n* It is an absurdly complicated subject, so take everything with a grain of salt.\n\n* It would be like NAFTA was for mexico <--> US / Canada, but with a few major differences.  \n\n* The first major difference, is that instead of targeting trade with Mexico, the point was to target trade with south east asia.\n\n* The second major difference was that NAFTA targeted manufacturing jobs (in return for cheaper goods).  TPP targeted service level jobs, and was very explicit in which industries for which countries.\n\n* For example, for the United States, jobs in nursing and retail work were specifically targeted and expected to be strongly adversely affected, in return for significantly expanded asian market penetration for things like American automotive exports and pharmaceuticals.\n\n* How could something like nursing be exported?  Well, that actually gets to the heart of the matter.  For the United States, the point of the TPP (and its sister acts) was to greatly, greatly strengthen and enforce IP law for south east asia, to match already existing IP and trade law in the US and Europe.\n\n* So whereas right now your bank probably hires American programmers, instead of programmers from Cambodia, for purely safety and enforcement reasons, that would change tomorrow.  And with the TPP, if you are a programmer, this would adversely affect you.  But nursing was specifically targeted, as bringing SE asia more in line with HIPAA guarantees would make it legally feasible to outsource more hospital overhead offshore.\n\n* This all means you could expect major offshoring of what are right now considered reputable and secure jobs in America, and for the act to be quite transformative for the economy.  In short, if your job isn't tied to the USA, and is easy to offshore, but hasn't been for logistic, legal or economic reasons, the TPP almost certainly changed the math involved with that equation (though of course it will be different for every job / industry).\n\n**Okay, so if America is trading away good jobs in entire industries, what does it get in return?**\n\n* Right now, if you are a large business that wants to get into Asian markets, you have two problems.  1) If you open in China, there's a good chance your designs will be eventually be stolen and given to a Chinese company, which the Chinese government will then later support at your expense.  And 2) The rest of SE asia has similar problems to varying degrees, and they all trade with China.\n\n* Additionally, right now Europe's economy is looking dead for the foreseeable future.  And since America isn't spending money jumpstarting our own economy, we're not likely to grow at a large rate any time soon either.\n\n* But asian economies are booming.  And as they do so, they are trading with each other, and making trade deals with each other that don't include us.  And that's a major disadvantage for America and Europe.\n\n* So the purpose of the TPP, from a western viewpoint, is to get SE asia into the same economic and legal framework as the western world, and open their markets to western companies.  \n\n* The second purpose of the TPP, is to get China to play ball too.  Right now, if we tell China to open their markets, and enforce western IP law, they'll laugh in our face (and do so).  We don't have the bartering chips for that deal.  But if the rest of SE asia is already doing so with the West, and builds their economies around such laws, then 15-20 years from now, it won't just be Europe / USA telling China to open their markets and enforce international IP law, it will be the vast majority of China's trading partners.  In short, it would be an economic coup d'etat for western powers, that would bring a _lot_ of money to large western companies and give Washington much more power in Asia.  If you are a citizen of the west, this is almost certainly a good thing.\n\n* So Obama and Clinton's bet, is that if we don't make a deal like the TPP, then Chinese (and by extension SE asian) companies are going to spring up as international competitors to American firms anyway.  And that increased competition represents lost profits that could otherwise have been made by western companies trading in China.  So by trading those jobs to outsourcing now, the US would be in a much more dominant position later, and it is worth the trade.\n\n**Okay, is that line of thinking valid?**\n\nYes and No.\n\n* If you are a CEO, or a powerful washington person.  Then yes, unequivocally.  The TPP means continued western and American worldwide economic hegemony and should be strongly fought for.  EU / USA firms cannot do business in China.  That's a major economic disadvantage for any western firm playing on that level.\n\n* For people who's jobs are not offshored, then yes, this is probably a good plan.  Just like NAFTA resulted in cheaper goods, TPP should result in cheaper services across the board.  \n\n* But if your job can be offshored (and the list of offshorable jobs the TPP will make cost effective to offshore is large), then it is more complicated.\n\n* If the USA had a real economic safety net, and put forward programs towards retraining and revitalizing areas specifically hit by offshoring and globalization, then you could vote for the TPP confidently.  This, for example is how the scandanavian countries handled integration into the EU, and overall there are very few cases of real economic hardship as the result of that integration.  Overall, it was a success story.\n\n* But after NAFTA, the USA implemented no such programs, whatsoever.  Economists at the time, believed them to be unnecessary.  The thinking was, that if free trade agreements resulted in more trade, which resulted in more jobs, then people who lost their jobs to outsourcing should have no difficulty finding new jobs in a free market.\n\n* The reality was that outsourcing resulted in chain effects whereby entire regions of the country lost all their good jobs, and the good jobs that remained moved to other US locations.  Combined with the fact that many people woke up one day to find that their entire career was no longer employable in their home country, meant that they simply could not find new work.  Add in again Greenspan's attempts to 'lower worker mobility to increase American labor competitiveness', and the end result is that today, in 2017, many families that lost their jobs due to nafta STILL are not employed.\n\nSo at the end of the day, you have to make a call.  Do you think that America will be like Scandanavia, and reinvest a portion of the profits reaped by greater access to Asian markets on economic growth, unemployment benefits, worker retraining and government programs?  Or do you think that America will call those things socialism, ignore the problem, and allow large companies to reap the economic rewards unmolested?\n\nPersonally, I fall into the second category, so I am very, very happy to see the TPP fail.  I think that given the second viewpoint, outsourcing service level jobs, in THIS economy, would be a death sentence for many, many people.  But that said, if you think that the first option is a possibility, then the TPP should be strongly supported.  And really, in an ideal world, if we could trust that America would take care of the people who would be harmed by the outsourcing, then we would want the TPP to pass, because increased trade and American competitiveness in the future is something that should be encouraged and worked towards.",

    "body": "Great write-up, thanks for posting this.\n\nJust to add a couple of important points:\n\n- Free trade only works *in principle* (ignoring lots of practical difficulties) to the benefit of all when you have free movement of both capital AND labor. We have this among states within the US, for example, and it's part of the secret to the US's historical economic susccess.\n- TPP would do nothing to help labor move, and so like the rest of globalization based solely on freedom of capital movement alone, it would continue to benefit only the capital class (i.e. rich shareholders) and screw workers both at home and abroad - and therefore fall short of most of its promised benefits.\n- TPP's aspirations to create working property rights regimes (i.e. where copyright and other IP is protected) were probably delusional. Enforcing copyright requires a working legal apparatus to support courts and litigation, and the only country in Asia that has anything approaching this is Japan (and *maybe* S. Korea). Creating such apparatus and enforcing IP would destroy a substantial portion of the manufacturing economy in virtually every SE Asian country, which would in turn make the shit at Walmart that the US imports from these countries by the boatload much more expensive. So the incentives are aligned entirely against this.\n- The only leverage the US has over SE Asia is as an importer. So either the US makes good on protectionist threats (like what Trump is making) to put huge tarrifs on everything coming out of Asia as a penalty for ignoring IP law (and environmental law, and child labor law, etc, etc.), or every country will just continue ignoring all of that law even if it's on the books. TPP probably would not have had much if any impact unless it was backed up by threats with real teeth, which it wasn't.",

I agree strongly with most of your points, though I find myself falling more on the support side despite our seeming inability to provide proper adjustments and safety nets. \n\nThe economic and security ramifications of ceding US and Western economic influence in East Asia is a major mistake from my opinion and the sinking of this deal will cause serious long term negatives for US power on the world stage. Of course, that doesn't negate your perspective, which is valid. Ideally I want people to start railing against the inability of our politicians to reform our economic system to compete in a global economy and stop railing against free trade. Demand trade adjustment and retraining programs. Demand a more sensible tax code and effective safety net. \n\nBlaming free trade and globalization, which I believe are inevitable and mostly desirable, will put us further behind when we should be moving forward. That is my major issue with the current brand of populism. It wants to manipulate market forces and economic development instead of providing the support necessary for transition. \n\nEdit: a couple of words",

And possibly which politicians and institutions have been for or against similar trade deals. Maybe they can compare similarities between deals, however different economic situations might affect those comparisons and make them completely bogus.\n\nI know I can't pick out good information on the TPP from bad information. I just don't know enough about international trade/ macroeconomics to detect BS. And I know that this is a cloudy issue; it would be very difficult for me to know what is a nuanced claim and what is a poor extrapolation of facts. \n\nTrump has shown me that he is a poor user of facts. Anti-Vax, anti climate change, the cyber... I know more about those subjects, I don't think that his narrative is a good representation of the truth. So that does make me more supportive of TPP.\n\nI generally like the idea of diplomacy and deals, so I am generally someone more supportive of something like the TPP.\n\nBut I couldn't recognize a great trade deal from a decent trade deal, so I'm not going to weight in. I wish other people would join me in doing so. They just look like idiots if they change position because of politics.\n\nJust look at Hilary Clinton with TPP, or Republicans on Russia. (Russia gets more aggressive over the last 4 years, but a change in politics means that Republicans are treating them like they are less aggressive?)\n\nSo yeah, definitely laugh at those who change position, but don't blame them for it. I'm sure that you have changed position of something once you learned more about it or once it was liked by someone you dislike.",

    "body": "I did a couple hours of research a few months ago.  The best I could come up with from neutral sources was what I put below.  Read all of the bullet points though, because I didn't neatly separate this list into pros and cons (if you even can).\n\n* It is an absurdly complicated subject, so take everything with a grain of salt.\n\n* It would be like NAFTA was for mexico <--> US / Canada, but with a few major differences.  \n\n* The first major difference, is that instead of targeting trade with Mexico, the point was to target trade with south east asia.\n\n* The second major difference was that NAFTA targeted manufacturing jobs (in return for cheaper goods).  TPP targeted service level jobs, and was very explicit in which industries for which countries.\n\n* For example, for the United States, jobs in nursing and retail work were specifically targeted and expected to be strongly adversely affected, in return for significantly expanded asian market penetration for things like American automotive exports and pharmaceuticals.\n\n* How could something like nursing be exported?  Well, that actually gets to the heart of the matter.  For the United States, the point of the TPP (and its sister acts) was to greatly, greatly strengthen and enforce IP law for south east asia, to match already existing IP and trade law in the US and Europe.\n\n* So whereas right now your bank probably hires American programmers, instead of programmers from Cambodia, for purely safety and enforcement reasons, that would change tomorrow.  And with the TPP, if you are a programmer, this would adversely affect you.  But nursing was specifically targeted, as bringing SE asia more in line with HIPAA guarantees would make it legally feasible to outsource more hospital overhead offshore.\n\n* This all means you could expect major offshoring of what are right now considered reputable and secure jobs in America, and for the act to be quite transformative for the economy.  In short, if your job isn't tied to the USA, and is easy to offshore, but hasn't been for logistic, legal or economic reasons, the TPP almost certainly changed the math involved with that equation (though of course it will be different for every job / industry).\n\n**Okay, so if America is trading away good jobs in entire industries, what does it get in return?**\n\n* Right now, if you are a large business that wants to get into Asian markets, you have two problems.  1) If you open in China, there's a good chance your designs will be eventually be stolen and given to a Chinese company, which the Chinese government will then later support at your expense.  And 2) The rest of SE asia has similar problems to varying degrees, and they all trade with China.\n\n* Additionally, right now Europe's economy is looking dead for the foreseeable future.  And since America isn't spending money jumpstarting our own economy, we're not likely to grow at a large rate any time soon either.\n\n* But asian economies are booming.  And as they do so, they are trading with each other, and making trade deals with each other that don't include us.  And that's a major disadvantage for America and Europe.\n\n* So the purpose of the TPP, from a western viewpoint, is to get SE asia into the same economic and legal framework as the western world, and open their markets to western companies.  \n\n* The second purpose of the TPP, is to get China to play ball too.  Right now, if we tell China to open their markets, and enforce western IP law, they'll laugh in our face (and do so).  We don't have the bartering chips for that deal.  But if the rest of SE asia is already doing so with the West, and builds their economies around such laws, then 15-20 years from now, it won't just be Europe / USA telling China to open their markets and enforce international IP law, it will be the vast majority of China's trading partners.  In short, it would be an economic coup d'etat for western powers, that would bring a _lot_ of money to large western companies and give Washington much more power in Asia.  If you are a citizen of the west, this is almost certainly a good thing.\n\n* So Obama and Clinton's bet, is that if we don't make a deal like the TPP, then Chinese (and by extension SE asian) companies are going to spring up as international competitors to American firms anyway.  And that increased competition represents lost profits that could otherwise have been made by western companies trading in China.  So by trading those jobs to outsourcing now, the US would be in a much more dominant position later, and it is worth the trade.\n\n**Okay, is that line of thinking valid?**\n\nYes and No.\n\n* If you are a CEO, or a powerful washington person.  Then yes, unequivocally.  The TPP means continued western and American worldwide economic hegemony and should be strongly fought for.  EU / USA firms cannot do business in China.  That's a major economic disadvantage for any western firm playing on that level.\n\n* For people who's jobs are not offshored, then yes, this is probably a good plan.  Just like NAFTA resulted in cheaper goods, TPP should result in cheaper services across the board.  \n\n* But if your job can be offshored (and the list of offshorable jobs the TPP will make cost effective to offshore is large), then it is more complicated.\n\n* If the USA had a real economic safety net, and put forward programs towards retraining and revitalizing areas specifically hit by offshoring and globalization, then you could vote for the TPP confidently.  This, for example is how the scandanavian countries handled integration into the EU, and overall there are very few cases of real economic hardship as the result of that integration.  Overall, it was a success story.\n\n* But after NAFTA, the USA implemented no such programs, whatsoever.  Economists at the time, believed them to be unnecessary.  The thinking was, that if free trade agreements resulted in more trade, which resulted in more jobs, then people who lost their jobs to outsourcing should have no difficulty finding new jobs in a free market.\n\n* The reality was that outsourcing resulted in chain effects whereby entire regions of the country lost all their good jobs, and the good jobs that remained moved to other US locations.  Combined with the fact that many people woke up one day to find that their entire career was no longer employable in their home country, meant that they simply could not find new work.  Add in again Greenspan's attempts to 'lower worker mobility to increase American labor competitiveness', and the end result is that today, in 2017, many families that lost their jobs due to nafta STILL are not employed.\n\nSo at the end of the day, you have to make a call.  Do you think that America will be like Scandanavia, and reinvest a portion of the profits reaped by greater access to Asian markets on economic growth, unemployment benefits, worker retraining and government programs?  Or do you think that America will call those things socialism, ignore the problem, and allow large companies to reap the economic rewards unmolested?\n\nPersonally, I fall into the second category, so I am very, very happy to see the TPP fail.  I think that given the second viewpoint, outsourcing service level jobs, in THIS economy, would be a death sentence for many, many people.  But that said, if you think that the first option is a possibility, then the TPP should be strongly supported.  And really, in an ideal world, if we could trust that America would take care of the people who would be harmed by the outsourcing, then we would want the TPP to pass, because increased trade and American competitiveness in the future is something that should be encouraged and worked towards.",

US thinks in quarters, China thinks in quarter-centuries, or longer.  They always play the long game.  **There is no advantage to them to allow a level playing field, as they believe over the long term, they will pivot their economy to mostly domestic consumption based**, rather than the current export base, and do not need to allow US to attempt to gain footing in their markets.\n>  \n> **This \u201cgive now to get later\u201d scheme has never worked well and is purely western style thinking.**  This is exactly what China loves about us, we\u2019re very predictable and they think about their economy very geo-politically, or militaristically.  Based on this, I have to fall squarely against TPP.  Our own motives will get used against us.\n>  \n> I also don\u2019t agree at all that we have no chips to play now, although they\u2019d be very painful chips to play out.  **We are their largest trading partner, by far \u2013 this is the advantage we hold today that we may not hold in 5-10 years.**  if US was willing to suffer a jump in prices here for the average consumer good, then we may be able to hurt them enough to play the game by our rules and open their markets.  This may well actually have to occur to cause movement in China.  This is exactly the game Trump is threatening to play, and it\u2019s a high risk play.  **Although I hate the guy, here is one area where his balls might work to our advantage \u2013 or fuck up the global economy for decades and spin the US into a recession overnight.

So republicans, the traditional party of corporate CEOs and laissez faire economics now wants to pursue protectionist policies to curb globalization and restore domestic manufacturing for the benefit of blue collar workers?

Make movies, music, art, games. Software. Ideas. Funner, safer, work. More interesting work. *Intellectual* work.\n\n**Todd:** But China and the developing countries will just copy it all! They already just steal all those designs and processes. They pirate that stuff. We won't be as rich!\n\n**Chip:** OK then - how about we do a free trade agreement every few years. Each time we give them more access to manufacture stuff for us, but, in return, we sneak in tighter Intellectual Property laws! Then we can still get paid for doing all the fun work. They can get paid to manufacture stuff. Everyone is better off!\n\n\n(It's not even a bad idea, and is actually working in some first-world countries. Except that Americans are extremely right-wing and have an almost hysterical socialism phobia, so the rich and powerful haven't allowed much of that re-training, education, benefits, basic income and stuff they were supposed to do for all those Americans who lost their jobs. As a result, everyone is worse off, even the rich, even though they have more money in their bank accounts now). ",

For the record I am with you on tpp sucking but I also think automation is gonna kill a hell of a lot more jobs than anything else and we're still not prepared for that. \n\nThe jobs not automated are outsourced, and the pool of new jobs created are not big enough to handle displaced workers or their families. \n\nImagine entire logistics and transportation workers wiped out and replaced with automated vehicles and boats. \n\n\nTaxi cabs, and bus services are generally an area that covers the working poor and lower middle class. Those jobs are being upended by uber drivers, and those uber drivers will have their jobs upended by ubers automated fleet. The phone app pay thing is just to get around existing taxi license laws in the same airbnb is unlicensed hotels. \n\nThey're hella useful on the consumer end but not the displacement of workers end. \n\nWe still haven't decided on UBI's efficacy yet (Finlands experiments not withstanding) in a post resource economy that may rapidly come about as a result of automation and the development of AI (could kill us or solve our organisational and structural problems with non zero sum solutions). \n\nI can see a lot of ways that the poorest and hardest to retrain get fucked over if there is no living wage so I'm skeptical about the potential pluses outweighing the massive minuses. \n\nFurthermore I can see Ubi being used as a political tool by successive governments as people get weaned onto having it, you might end up having to exchange more freedoms in return for keeping your living wages increasing at the rate they would be increased.\n\nI can also see a world where mass automation may lead to cars that you can't drive on your own, or that you have only a list of preapproved destinations your self driving car can travel too.  All rights and freedoms restricted 'in the interest of yours and others safety'. \n\nNo random trip to the beach, last minute change on an empty road making a dodgy uturn because no one is around.  No stopping a car near an accident to quickly save someone's life.  No choice.  With choice comes risk.  Taking away rights minimises risk but also autonomy.

My understanding (not an economist) is that large, multilateral trade agreements (especially NAFTA) have been instrumental in keeping prices down for the consumer *because* of the offshoring of manufacturing jobs and the nature of free trade itself.  If companies can't get the cheap labor overseas or in Mexico, that cost gets passed along to the consumer.\n\nI'm not sure I'm following his logic completely when he talks about a legal apparatus for IP crippling the manufacturing sector of SE Asian countries.

I don't recall, personally.  \n\nWould TPP not have created a level playing field in terms of IP and helped these countries to navigate the establishment of and mechanisms for working within such an apparatus? Thereby making IP more secure and above-board? I can't see how that is bad for American companies or their workers.

This means that, if you had a job, it is now somewhere else, and pays a lot less.\n\nSo, in short, the jobs move to Cambodia and pay Cambodian wages, destroying American livelihoods.\n\nIn theory, people should be able to find new jobs, but in practice, there are so many more poor Cambodians that, even the new jobs created will get swamped by them. Especially since the theory is that new, high wage jobs will be created that somehow people from \"elsewhere\" can't do.\n\nBut, people from elsewhere are remarkably similar in capabilities, and charge a lot less, meaning its a race to the bottom.",

As you imply, it wasn't objectively 100% bad or 100% good.  The main points were to reduce/eliminate tariffs and raise all nations' environmental, commercial, and labor laws to similar standards.  Most economists predicted it would have a positive impact for all countries involved (economists generally say that free trade is a good thing, since it allows all countries to focus on the industries which they are best at.  You don't want the US making cheap plastic toys when it could be making more airplanes, for instance).\n\nReddit, I suspect, generally abhorred the copyright/IP section of the TPP which would've made Asian countries subject to the same sort of IP laws the US has.  Another touchy subject is Investor State Dispute Settlement (ISDS), in which foreign companies could sue countries for discriminating against them or wrongly seizing assets, etc.  These suits would be settled by third party arbitrators.   I suspect many redditors saw this as an attack on a country's sovereignty, although the counter argument is that the trade deal would have no teeth without a mechanism like this.",

Instead, let's focus on two major points: 1) differences in scale, and 2) protectionism by US trading partners. \n\nScale: There are differences in scale that must be taken into account. A city may have certain laws and regulations that deviate from those imposed by a county, which may deviate from those imposed by a state, which may deviate from those imposed by a country. Few people would argue that California is a more business-friendly state than Texas. But the difference in laws between California and Texas is miniscule compared to the difference in laws between the US and China. A California business might consider moving to Texas to pay a lower minimum wage, but might also stay in California due to other factors, like infrastructure. But when confronted with the opportunity to head into SE Asia to pay slave wages for products, you're gonna try to find a way into SE Asia. \n\nProtectionism: China (and others) impose numerous and steep barriers to entry for US imports, while we don't do the same to them. There is no analogy for this in the United States... We learned our lesson under the Articles of the Confederation, and created the Commerce Clause to prevent those kinds of things from happening. Now let's say you want to sell products to the US and China. Only an idiot -- or somebody without access to the necessary resources -- would produce in the US... just look at the options. Produce in US: pay higher US wages, deal with larger quantity of US regulations, pay massive Chinese fees to sell to the larger market, jump through a bunch of Chinese hoops to sell to the larger market, and get your IP stolen anyway. Produce in China: pay slave wages, deal with practically no regulations, easily sell to both markets, and still get your IP stolen (but at least you're making more money). The choice is obvious. \n\nRelationship of scale and protectionism, and how this fits into a pro-free market stance: At this point we aren't talking about businesses operating in a singular free market -- we are talking about two totally different markets. For capitalism to work in the best interest of those people who make up the market, the governments in charge of facilitating capitalism need to operate more or less on the same page. Every single law doesn't need to be exactly the same, but at some point the differences become so vast that you're not in a free market -- you're in a system that exploits slave labor and asymmetrically punishes half the actors through Chinese protectionism before trade even starts.  \n\nMy hope is that we are able to reach agreements with country's like China that allow the promise of globalism to come to fruition. For that to happen, we are probably going to need the leverage that proportionate protectionism can provide. I view policy proposals like tariffs on goods produced by American-owned companies oversees as a way to force other countries to come to the negotiating table so we can have fair and free trade. ",

The world is FILLED with intelligent people and we dont seem to realize it. In the past, the US was one of the only stable nations in the world so huge numbers of smart people flocked here which greatly, hugely, massively boosted our ability to create intellectual goods. Many more stable countries exist now though so the impetus to leave is much lower, especially in Asia. America needs to wake up and understand that we need to educate our own citizens and focus on creating an intelligent citizenry because we cant rely heavily anymore on importing genius and at the same time, those same countries are going to start competing strongly in the intellectual field.",

I heard the same Syrian cookie company bankrolled by the liberal party like 9 times now).\n\n When Donald Trump won the primary it was like hold on, non-stop Donald reporting.

I am going to ask Congress to pass this ban into law so that it cannot be lifted by executive order.\n> \n> **Second:** I am going to ask Congress to institute its own 5-year ban on lobbying by former members of Congress and their staffs.\n> \n> **Third:** I am going to expand the definition of lobbyist so we close all the loopholes that former government officials use by labeling themselves consultants and advisors when we all know they are lobbyists.\n> \n> **Fourth:** I am going to issue a lifetime ban against senior executive branch officials lobbying on behalf of a foreign government.\n> \n> **And Fifth:** I am going to ask Congress to pass a campaign finance reform that prevents registered foreign lobbyists from raising money in American elections.\n\n[Source](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/press-releases/trump-details-ethics-reform-plan)",
