I guess here in America everyone has guns so we just shoot each other, but something about throwing acid seems almost more evil to me like in a Cerci Lannister type of way. Like nobody carries acid on them for defense it's always premeditated and deliberate. Acid is not typically lethal from what I believe, so the attacker knows the victim will live out their life with the constant reminder through the pain and scars, which in the attackers eyes is a lifelong punishment and reminder of \"what they did.\" Also it seems like most victims are targeted by attackers they've never met and even sometimes at random for simply being a person of that faith, color, country or whatever stupid reason. Throwing acid just seems so intentionally deliberate that the the attacker views the victim as not simply a horrible person or even someone they could call an enemy but something less than human. Not that that same can't be said about firearms too but I just feel like the percentage of justifiable uses of acid are far less than the percentages of justifiable or even simply arguably justifiable shootings, which in a sense seems more evil to me in a way.\n\nNot sure if any of that makes any sense because I'm speaking on a subject I know little about based on generalizations I was led to believe from a country where throwing acid is extremely rare and gun violence is over 150x the annual rate of the U.K. Either way this seems like great news and long over due.",

    "body": "To clarify, the law hasn't been changed but the Crown Prosecution Service is changing which charges are to be brought forward in court. There are two types of grievous bodily harm offences, a section 20 and a section 18 offence.\n\nSection 20 holds a maximum sentence of 5 years imprisonment whereas the harsher section 18 offence holds a maximum sentence of life imprisonment. The difference? Section 18 applies in situations where the accused intended to cause grievous bodily harm or intended to resist lawful arrest.\n\nTo my understanding prosecutors don't normally go for the Section 18 offence because 1. It's more difficult to prove in court and 2. These cases have to be tried by jury in the Crown Court, which means legal proceedings are more expensive and take more time.\n\nFocusing more on landing harsher imprisonments for those who use acid to attack people is a good thing. It takes a special kind of fucking coward to splash sulphuric acid into someone's face.",

They are worse weapons than knives and sentences need to reflect this. They need to make it not worth the risk carrying them in the first place unless you have an excuse (are taking it home from the shop to clean with, where investigation would show you had recently bought it and it would be in the original container, which is usually not simple to open quickly). Perhaps there should be a law requiring corrosive substances to be sold in containers that cannot be opened easily or sprayed easily so they are useless as weapons as sold so, you cannot claim you have bought it and are taking it home or something and, it be useful as a weapon.\n\nThere is a lot of talk about restricting sales but, this is useless. A wide range of household cleaning substances can be used. It is hopeless to make it hard to buy things that can be used in this way or, even to register every sale. There is talk of registration on buying acid or requiring a license to buy it but, it is widely used as drain cleaner and limescale cleaner and not hard to make and, there are plenty of other corrosive substances to use. Many of these attacks are actually using strong alkalies anyway. It would be no help if there was a register of everyone who had bought bleach because there would be too many people on the list for it to be helpful. ",

Just youtube them if you want a good idea how much worse they can get. To put it into clearer context. You can TOUCH sulphuric acid with the palms of your hands and not burn yourself. But that's only because of the moisture content of the skin in your palms compared to the rest of the body. I wouldn't recommend trying it, as you could slip up and dunk your hand, which would be bad if not washed off in well under 10 seconds.

I'm sure there's plenty of people who would love to go punch someone, somewhere in the face, but restrain themselves solely because they know they'd get in trouble for it. But it's very hard to measure the impacts of deterrence. Even more so for very serious crimes, where you need to be a pretty bad person to even *want* to do it (but even then, we have to think about things like \"how many people would kill someone who raped them or a loved one if there were no consequences?\"). And I imagine that if there was really no consequences, many people would have no issues stealing something from someone rich.\n\nThat said, specifically here, it's hard to picture someone being deterred from an acid attack. I just can't imagine that someone would actually expect to get away with it. It's the type of crime where I'd expect the guilty person to get caught most of the time. And punishments are already severe enough that I'd expect deterrence to have \"kicked in\" for anyone it would have.\n\nThat said, such heinous crimes strike me as the type where the offender is a danger to society. No one in a good state of mind would resort to an acid attack (especially for the reasons these attacks typically happen, such as being spurned romantically). They don't seem like the type that would be easily rehabilitated (and since it's a maximum sentence, the legal system could always sentence less if there's something to indicate otherwise).",

Coincidentally, this mist can travel a fair distance, and really, really fucking hurts when it lands on your face (it is a bad time, trust me).  That isn't the fun fact though, that was just a shitty accident I learned some life lessons from.\n\nThe fun fact is that apparently as long as it stays above 90%ish concentration, it'll happily sit inside stainless steel tanks without eating through them.  Likewise at lower concentrations like 0-10%.  But *apparently*, if the concentration drops below 90% and starts mixing with more water and you get to the 70-80% range, it'll fuck up that metal like a dog through peanut butter and spill out all over the factory and make a huge, terrifying mess to clean up that ends up looking like black liquid death magma as it chews through a bunch of shit on its way to outside and through the dirt.  This then dilutes it and lowers its concentration even more making it magically become even more caustic to everything around it because sulphuric acid doesn't give a shit about logic, it only lives to consume.  So apparently that shit is better stored at like 100% acid (as pointed out by laimh, I believe it usually ships at 98%), because lower concentrations are somehow *more fucking caustic*.\n\nGod that plant was a shitshow, but that's how destructive acid can be.  In less than an hour it destroyed hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of industrial equipment; your face doesn't stand a chance.  Fuck acid, I hate working around it now.  And fuck anyone who throws it in someone's face, that's horrible.  I don't wish that on anyone, not even my worst enemy.",

The Model penal code lists the following (definitions copied from Wikipedia):\n\n1. **Negligently**: a \"reasonable person\" would be aware of a \"substantial and unjustifiable risk\" that his conduct is of a prohibited nature, will lead to a prohibited result, and/or is under prohibited attendant circumstances, and the actor was not so aware but should have been.\n\n    Example: you don't pay proper attention when driving and thus hurt someone. Your negligence (lack of due care when driving) makes it not a true accident.\n2. **Recklessly**: the actor consciously disregards a \"substantial and unjustifiable risk\" that his conduct is of a prohibited nature, will lead to a prohibited result, and/or is of a prohibited nature.\n\n    Example: You are speeding well above the speed limit in a residential area and hurt someone. That goes beyond negligence as you should know that this is dangerous and risky.\n3. **Knowingly**: the actor is practically certain that his conduct will lead to the result, or is aware to a high probability that his conduct is of a prohibited nature, or is aware to a high probability that the attendant circumstances exist.\n\n    Example: You hate your neighbor and how rich he is, so you burn his house down while he's out. Unbeknownst to you, there was a guest staying in the house who dies. You didn't intend to kill them, but the level of risk that your actions entailed meant you should have known that this would easily have resulted.\n4. **Purposefully**: the actor has the \"conscious object\" of engaging in conduct and believes or hopes that the attendant circumstances exist.\n\n    Example: You walk up to someone and blow their brains out cause, I dunno, you're a psychopath.\n\nThe exact degree that would fit a crime is circumstantial and must be proven in court. Which also means it can vary based on how good one's lawyers are. The difference is very blurred for lots of crimes, too. My example for the first one could be argued in many cases as being reckless, depending on exactly what you did (but generally lack of due care is a lower tier level of criminality than brashfully acting in known dangerous ways).\n\nNote that some laws are strict liability, so have *no* mens rea. That means if you break the law, it doesn't matter what your state of mind was. Many would argue that this is a bad thing because intent *should* matter in most cases. Strict liability can be argued as useful in some cases simply because it makes prosecution very straightforward. It makes sense for minor crimes or areas that are heavily regulated to the point that you must be sure to follow regulations in order to operate a business in that field (as otherwise enforcing regulations is very difficult and its easy for people to ignore regulation because they'll get lax punishments if they ever get caught).",

We just were in the same building (obviously) as our equipment monitored gas transfer ducts for SO2/SO3 and O2 along with stack emissions.  We do use ultrasonic equipment to measure flows and temps and such, so I understand what you mean.\n\nI know a lot more about gas chemistry than I do about aqueous stuff.  So I of course know about all the scary industrial gases like SO3, H2S, etc.  I don't really know all that much about acids though, so it was weird to me to hear that the acid concentration dropping below 90% was a *bad* thing for how caustic it was.  Though apparently the workers were unaware of this fact too when they cleaned up a previous spill with water, then shovelled up the diluted solution back into the holding tanks and then started up the process again.  Bye bye everything in that building that wasn't specifically designed to be inert to it, and even some things that were to a degree.\n\nSo actually your response is news to me and pretty informative, thanks :)",

When I watched this, it changed my perception of the ordeal.  They are both relatively strong willed, and strong women (been subjected to various explosions, high temperature chemical reactions, physically rigorous stints, and mad scientists), but watching them crack shook me.  Side note: [Adam Savage](http://www.thefamouspeople.com/profiles/images/adam-savage-4.jpg) went through a similar ordeal, but he was reclined (not laying down) and unrestrained.  Forewarning: the clip of the episode that is linked is very low quality.",

I'm not talking about people letting things break, I am talking about people going up to conveyors and jamming 2x4s into them to fuck them up on purpose.  Or intentionally running 600V into 120V panels to kill equipment.  They knew the major engineering firm overseeing this project couldn't leave until it was \"finished\" so they'd create as many obstacles as they could to get them to stay.  Well, not all of them, that isn't fair, but some locals for sure.\n\nHell, the guy that owned the town had the police throw us out of the plant on occasion because he thought that would make us go faster somehow?  There are some derpy Canadian workers too, but the general situation at this place isn't anything like a plant in Canada.  Thankfully.",
