Hanging out with your young daughter and some crocs is a little bit different though, and i understand that point of view.\n\nHowever i hope you didnt strain your ankle jumping to the rest of those conclusions....Steve had programs shown on aussie tv, and featured on a lot of stuff too. A lot of the work he was doing was actually focussed around the health of the animal. If it wasn't, then it was always very educational for us - differentiating between venemous snakes and spiders, signs of aggression, contact numbers and proceedures incase you're bitten by something or if you find an injured animal..\n\n\nThe benefits far outweigh the negatives, and if you disagree you can ~~fuck right off cunt~~ understand the situation better by thinking about it surrounded by nature, like Steve did.",

No one has ever died from one, that we know of.\n\nCone snails have killed like 30 people. Thankfully, very few people actually live along Australia's northern coasts. It's thousands of kilometers of deserted wilderness, for the most part.\n\nRedback spiders are common, but easily recognized and non-aggressive. Funnel webs and mouse spiders are aggressive, but less common. Spider bites *DO* happen, so Australian hospitals are stocked with antivenom and no one has died from a spider in decades.\n\nOh, also Koalas are aggressive like honey badgers, and male Platypi have poisonous barbs. Echidnas have nasty spines (but are super duper cute and not aggressive). Kangaroos can maul a person and have been known to drown dogs, but generally run from humans like big hopping deer.\n\nThat being said, you're still more likely to be struck dead by lightning than killed by any of these animals.\n\nJellies do sting people, which can make our northern beaches dangerous. We have jelly nets for this reason.\n\nAnyway, if a python bit me I would be pretty pissed. Those fangs hurt like a bitch.",

His life revolved around teaching others about his love of animals and you can literally just feel the pure love and joy spewing off of him whenever he talks. Some people love to hate but I don't even think its really possible for any normal person to even dislike him. He was such a big part of my animal passion and education as a kid and the only time in my life a celebrity death has been gut wrenching.... I'm sure its that way for a large percentage of people who grew up watching and learning from him.",

    "body": "Australian here who, many years ago when I was less mature I suppose, felt like that. It was kinda the cringe factor - you get sick of going overseas and people making the same tired old 'jokes' about Australia soon as they find out you're Australian (shrimp on the barbie, dingo got my baby, Steve Irwin etc.) Americans in particular (since they were by far the biggest market for those TV shows and advertising campaigns etc. in the 70s and 80s). It seems like that kind of stereotype is the only thing people know about Australia, when in truth most Australians live very urban lives (and don't have an accent anywhere near as strong Steve Irwin or Paul Hogan).\n\nBeing a smaller country I feel that Australians want to portray Australia as a modern and sophisticated country like the 'big boys' (which it is - take a look at any quality of life ranking or human development index out there), known for things other than this stereotypical stuff. As I got older though I realised that uniqueness is what gets people interested in a place, so people like Steve definitely had a positive effect on Australia's image. I did actually briefly meet Steve Irwin once (I have relatives who live in Glasshouse Mountains right next to his zoo there), and like everyone says he was a nice guy.\n\nI think that cultural cringe is actually fading on a wider scale these days too - just look how many Aussies on Reddit deliberately play up the 'Australianness' of the way they speak (well, type).",

A lot of us thought Steve was hamming up the Australian stereotype for the sake of the American audiences. We only began to realise he was genuine in later years, and I think a lot of us didn't realise the extent of his work until he died. These days you'd be hard pressed to find an Australian that doesn't consider Steve a national treasure. ",

After he died it started mass rioting as many claimed he was a false god. Thus sparking the second great emu war. We lost a lot of good people that month...\n\nEDIT: Figured I would add some extra detail.\n\nAfter the Emu War the world leaders called to hold a summit in Australia to discuss where to put their Irwins. Unfortunately [Osama Bin Laden decided to crash the event](https://youtu.be/TdnAaQ0n5-8?t=106) and was thus called off. George Bush then decreed that we possessed weapons of mass destruction and started the 10 year invasion. However us being Australians, we did not realise it was an invasion and just offered all the American soldiers a beer. Nobody died in that invasion. American soldiers by the end refused to even fire a gun at us, and many decided to stay and burn their previous nations flag. This bought on the era of prosperity and was further accelerated when we discovered [Australium](https://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Australium).",
