If a tweet was deleted, they would post the text up and the politician who posted it up on the site. \n\nHowever, Twitter shut them down by closing off their API access, making it virtually impossible to do what they had been doing before.

    "body": "I am sure this is going to be buried but I want to offer my knowledge of having worked with Twitter's and other social networks APIs and have read those boring Terms of Service rules.\n\nFirst off APIs provide an official backdoor for third parties to obtain information from a site about you, most of these are heavily regulated and generally require your authorization in order to obtain that information. Some sites, like Twitter, make all their public activities, in this case tweets, available without authorization. \n\nHowever under the terms of service in using Twitter's, and most others, when an application using the API is notified that an item was deleted they must also remove it from their system.This is where these sites got into trouble and the \"internal debate\" at Twitter took place. Under the terms this means that when a politician deleted a tweet, these site must also remove the tweet, which they don't because their whole purpose is to prevent this for politicians.\n\nThis rule requiring applications to delete tweets is blanket and applies to all Twitter accounts including yours. The spirit of this rule is to try and prevent that tweet you mistakenly made from being stuck out there and you can never take it back. So the debate at Twitter was, should this rule exclude politicians? And judging by the result it was no. With this decision these archiving sites were in violation of Twitter's terms of service, so their API access was revoked and were most likely sent DMCA requests to remove what tweets they had already copied since all tweets are technically copyrighted by Twitter thus shutting down the sites.\n\nWhether or not you agree with Twitter's decision to not classify politicians accounts as exclusions to the deletion rule, Twitter's goal is to protect its users' right to privacy.\n\nOn a side note I have seen people mention that these sites could switch to web crawling to obtain these tweets. The answer is no they could not, probably. This comes back to tweets being copyrighted materials of Twitter, meaning they could make the case that by archiving the tweets without Twitter's permission they are violating the DMCA. Although the sites could argue that they are using the tweets in a review or editorial fashion thus excluding them from the DMCA. It would be an issue settled in court and who knows who would win.",

I doubt this, because screenshots are less trustworthy as they're easier to fake, so it probably was a text archive with time stamps.\n\n>I wrote this up people who are confused about the websites worked and how they were shut down. Please feel to correct me if I'm wrong. \n\n>---\n\n>Twitter let those sites use their API, where the site's bots then crawled the pages of politicians and accounting for all their tweets. If a tweet was deleted, they would post the text up and the politician who posted it up on the site. \n\n>However, Twitter shut them down by closing off their API access, making it virtually impossible to do what they had been doing before. \n\n>Again, please feel free to expand on this or to correct me if I'm wrong in any way!\n\nEdit: spelling and added link\n",

For example, your Service should execute the unfavorite and delete actions by removing all relevant Content, not by publicly displaying to other users that the Tweet is no longer favorited or has been deleted.\n\n...\n\n>Take all reasonable efforts to do the following, provided that when requested by Twitter, you must promptly take such actions:\n\n>i. Delete Content that Twitter reports as deleted or expired;\n\n>ii. Change treatment of Content that Twitter reports is subject to changed sharing options (e.g., become protected); and\n\n>iii.

Why should a social media site involve itself with politics?\n\nIP bans will likely be effective. If you think otherwise, try blocking out a few hours to try and screen scrape Google in a large enough volume to matter. PROTIP: you can't, because Google has extremely smart filters set up to stop you. I had a random one-off job to count the Google results for a bunch of keywords, and I discovered that even when I went through Tor, Google would block me within a few seconds of switching endpoints.

Your access to and use of the Services are conditioned on your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms. **By accessing or using the Services you agree to be bound by these Terms.**\n\n---\n\nHere's how the rules apply:\n\n1. If you're using Twitter, you agree to the Terms of Service.\n2. If you wish to reproduce a tweet, you must use the Twitter API as per the Terms of Service (I.2.f)\n3. By using the Twitter API, you agree to the developer agreement which prohibits publicly displaying if a tweet is deleted or not\n\nRegardless of how you attempt to display a deleted tweet, you've violated an agreement with Twitter in some shape or form.  You either violated the developer agreement, or you violated the main ToS for not using the Twitter API to reproduce the tweet.\n\n---\n\nIt should be noted that Twitter does not prohibit displaying deleted tweets.  It prohibits displaying deleted or un-favorited tweets that are labeled as such.  \nFor example, if a site mirrors a tweet and that tweet is later deleted, the site itself may have missed that update and still have the tweet on display.  That kind of thing happens all the time on accident.  \nIf the site knows that the tweet has been deleted or un-favorited and marks it as such, now it's in violation of the developer agreement.\n\nAs per your question: you're free to use the Twitter API to copy or mirror as many tweets as you want.  You can even publicly mirror all of those tweets.  However, you cannot relay to the end user which tweets have been deleted or un-favorited.  That means either marking the tweets as such, or leaving the tweets unmarked but only displaying deleted/un-favorited tweets by virtue of the site's purpose.",

The goal of any corporation is to make the shareholder's money. \n\nDepending on the wishes of the board, the officers/corporation can take many avenues to make a profit. It's a judgment area, but the CEO is not empowered to say fuck profits all together. A CEO can say fuck profits this year for the goal of more profits in the next decade. Or the CEO can say we will be green to better build our brand.\n\nSo let's say a CEO wants to spend 100 million dollars of the corporations money to build a new park. That's probably an awesome thing to do, but when justifying the action to the board the CEO will be talking about tax credits, PR, advertising, and permanent park naming rights. ",

It's a nice idea, but when people get tired and see themselves not working anymore, having a few million or (again, if you 'sold out' well enough) a few hundred million in the bank for your children and your children's children.. that's a bit more important than having the reddit community no longer view you as an internet champion.

Especially in cases where the board and top officers don't have a controlling interest of stock in the company. \n\nAnd then of course you have to ask yourself what oil company or pharmaceutical company is going to have a board that will approve the hiring of a CEO or whatever with those sort of moral holdings that they put into action through the policies they employ as CEO and the answer if fucking none.\n\nBecause the board is elected by people who just want ROI and the board members are often major investors so they just want ROI and so then they hire someone who can promise them the biggest ROI and the board feels will take the hit on all the shitty things the executives will have to do to bring that promise to fruition. \n\nHilariously if you then get a senior executive with any kind of conscience or intent to do good with the company that motherfucker gets kicked to the curb faster than you can say \"UNEMPLOYMENT\" because maximizing profits is what the game is all about and if you are there for anything else you are in the wrong place.\n\nSo yeah it's an oversimplification but even though companies aren't specifically legally bound to only pursue profit to any end that's pretty much what happens. \n\nIf you're a car manufacturer and you get a report that a car you've been selling for years has a previously undiscovered defect that is killing and injuring people do you report it to NHTSA and announce a recall or do you run the actuarials, determine how many people are going to come after the company with lawsuits, how much the average judgement will be and then compare that to the cost of a recall? Of course you do the latter first and if the recall is cheaper you immediately do that because you get a bounce on company image which leads to sales but if recall costs substantially more what do you do? \n\nWell you hide it as long as you can and then pay off like a slot machine to anyone who files a claim as long as they are willing to sign a non-disclosure and you don't have to admit liability. \n\nThen when the shit hits the fan you dump your stock, take your golden parachute and let the new guys who take over clean up your mess. It really helps them that they can blame you for everything as it makes them look like the responsible folks cleaning up a problem someone else created. \n\n[Just ask GM.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_General_Motors_recall) Or for that matter pretty much any company that sells a product that kills people.",
