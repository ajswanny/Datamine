Robots would remove that risk for invading nations.\n\nBut back on the the opposite side: less war crimes from the troops.\n\nIt's a mixed bag, really. I hope everyone will consider all possibilities, rather than exclusively listening to Elon Musk *just because* he's Elon Musk.\n\nEven if \"killer robots\" are banned, it just opens to door for cybernetic enhancement of human troops. Would you rather have killer robots, or a military that replaces the hands, arms, or legs of their troops with weapons? Rather than figuratively turning people into weapons, now they literally are weapons.",

    "body": "Humans in war are pretty terrible. For one, they're fragile lumps that can't take much in the way of punishment, they're also pretty slow communicators especially when under fire, they cost a hell of a lot to train, they're sympathic and don't typically don't want to kill and they need to rest, sleep they get psychologically scarred and when they die it is terrible press at home.\n\nThis is how things I think things will likely be in the future of warfare. We will see a fleet of autonomous drone bots that will use leading edge machine learning algorithms to identify hostile targets, and then as a unified, highly connected machine, these bots will seek and destroy said targets possibly without any input from a human operator, although a single yes/no by a remote operator will be enough. This fleet will be utterly remorseless and 100% focused. It will have constant feedback about the target until the target is eliminated. They will attack on all fronts, air, land, water and there will be nowhere to hide. I can easily imagine cheap air drones being mass produced that have no weapons apart from an explosive and speed, like a swarm of bees that will just flood an area until it achieves it's kill. Image how useful this would have been in mapping and clearing the tunnels in Afghanistan of Taliban targets. As a fighting unit, a drone army will simply not lose to a human one, and even if it does it won't matter as drones will be cheap and disposable. \n\nOnce proven in battle, it's hard to imagine that drones won't be used in other fields. For mass crowd control to suppress demonstrations, or for standard law enforcement. In the same way as politicians are now realising the power of mass surveillance of the voting population being introduced under the guise of terrorism, we will see terror being used to allow killing machines to become the norm in our society, and it follows that soon after that it will really not take much for some despot to take full control of that system.

If everyone signs on to a robot ban all of those countries will work extra hard to ensure that no one violates the ban, including China if it wants to keep its opponents from violating the agreement themselves! \n\nIt's one of the big reasons why the NPT and CWC have largely been very effective. Outside of rogue states there have been very, very few violations out of hundreds of countries signed on. For agreements without an enforcement mechanism that's a big success. ",

It only affect ground troops and even for those you have gear that neutralizes the gas. The only military use is spreading terror and killing civilians, even in WW2 you rarely saw it used because it had rather little impact.  Easy to ban something like that because everyone knows a bunch of nukes or cruise missiles make poison gas obsolete. Biological agents are a bit more difficult but ultimately the risk of it backfiring horribly and spreading unctrolled is too high for most to take.\n\nGiant Death Robots are way too important strategically that any superpower would agree on a ban here.",

The federal government is *not* directly my government. That's why, when we vote for President, we choose the presidential candidate best for our State, and our State casts all its votes for the winner for that State. Its the government over the states, composed of those states. Its like the council of Ricks. If *your* Rick had a problem with the council, would *you* be a traitor for fighting v. the council with him? or would you be a traitor Morty by helping the council to bring him in?",

There's really no mention of secession in the constitution, or what should be done about those who secede. And while the civil war is a sort of case law in what happens should secession occur, there is still no explicit mention of it in the amendments, to my knowledge.",

The acquisition of power whether sought or unsought by the military industrial complex was already proving to be a problem.  Today the department of defense has a budget of over $600B a year.  That's four international space stations a year, to dominate the planet militarily speaking. Today it costs over $400/gallon paying private contractors to transport fuel to where we need it in the middle east.  How many gallons does a single humvee go through?  Similarly, a painting sold at auction by Christie's for $140m dollars. Down the street from that place, in Manhattan, you can buy truffles for $70 000. Who can afford that? Not even most doctors or lawyers, pooling their resources.  Something is broken.  Banking CEO's and private defense contractors can afford those things.  That's about it.\n\n[Hiding in plain sight.

There weren't decades of Cold War terror infesting all of society yet, and as far as MacArthur was concerned, nukes were just another weapon in his arsenal that he should deploy as required to accomplish his objectives and minimize friendly casualties. Telling him not to use nukes was tantamount to telling him to send more 20 year old soldiers to die.\n\nFuture decades hugely expanded the destructive capabilities of nuclear weapons, and as time went on and more wars began and concluded without their use, they've assumed their position as an ultimate weapon with as much symbolic power as actual explosive power.

Remember that time that the F-35 was being demonstrated and the gun weapon system wasn't ready?  That was some key engineering or testing dude that took a 2 or 3 week cruise, had to have surgery, or left and had to be replaced, which delayed the testing.\n\nThe defense industry definitely saps a lot of money, but most of it is going to engineers, project managers, and retired vet SMEs.  There are well paid executives, but no more than at most companies, and in the defense industry there are a lot of small businesses that don't make bank and just fill niche needs.

    "body": "It's pretty easy to condemn the Southern States, but when you look at history, you have to put yourself into the morals and ethics of those times. For most of the population of the South, the Civil War *was not* about slavery. Most of the population of the south were poor farmers, poor white farmers. Slavery hurt them, financially. But they still volunteered to fight and die in the war, instead of just turning? The why is interesting, but would take a book-like post, but the thing I'm saying is - you can't take actors out of a time period, and expect them to have the moral compass of someone with our education, upbringing, etc. You have to view people as products of the time and society which raised them. \n\n\nFor the North, the civil war was *absolutely* billed as a war to end slavery - no dispute - it was advertised as nearly a holy war by evangelicals to free people. But the South was fighting for different reasons, and, that's kind of obvious - no one fights for something they could even remotely see as \"evil.\" \n\n\nSo while I of course would never side with my state to fight for any kind of social injustice, or over any kind of bigotry, there's still a good chance that in 100 years I might still be condemned for my morals, as those constantly improve. \n\n\n100 years ago I might have felt it quite within my parental powers to send my 14 year old son to work in a mill to get extra money for our family. 50 years ago, certainly, it was the correct parenting thing to physically reprimand children. \n\n\nImagine in 100 years after meat is routinely grown from bacteria - will we all be condemned for partaking in the slaughterhouse to store method of getting our protein? \n\n\nI'm not saying that the South was anywhere *close* to right, and I would hope if I were alive at that time I'd have the education and upbringing to see that and fight against it. But I *am* saying that no one in history (hopefully) has ever set out to be the \"villain\" and lay down their life for something they view as wicked. When you read history, its much more interesting if you ask \"Why\" \"why would so many choose to elect Hitler?\" \"Why would so many... poor white farmers put their life on the line to fight for an institution that damaged their livelihood and families?\" You learn a lot about the society and institutions that way. And in that way, I think, we can also best learn from history, and improve those institutions. ",
