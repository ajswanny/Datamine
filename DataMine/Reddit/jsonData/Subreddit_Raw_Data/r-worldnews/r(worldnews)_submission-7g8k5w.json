A decade later, you\u2019re filling out a questionnaire prior to having an MRI to see just how bad your rotator cuff has gotten since that incident in Cleveland five years ago. You\u2019re curt with the desk jockey checking you in, you don\u2019t like talking about what happened. You could\u2019ve been in Alpena, but wound up doing body shots off Drew Carey at Lola\u2019s before your mind just shuts down.\n\nYou check off the \u201cno\u201d box next to a question regarding previous contact with metal and the possibility of some being in your eye. You haven\u2019t had a job that would cause metal to get in your eyes. After a final review with the MRI tech, they get you into the room and onto the table. The table is then slid back into the gantry and the 3 Tesla magnet clanks into motion. \n\nThe movement of that spec of hot pink steel from the back of your left eyeball through the vitreous humor, lens, and cornea to embed in the machinery above takes a fraction of a second. Once your brain registers the injury, you let out a blood curdling scream as you flail about in the claustrophobic gantry. The tech comes running out, having never seen such a reaction to what she assumes is claustrophobia until she gets you sitting upright to see your wounded eye not only bloodshot, but bleeding and leaking the gel-like vitreous humor. The tech dashes to the phone, calling out a Code Blue before donning a pair of nitrile gloves and raiding the nearby first aid kit for gauze pads. \n\nYou think back on it in your old age, fingers reaching up for your eye patch and stroking it briefly.  You were too proud to get a glass eye. You\u2019re uncertain which event was worse: the \u201cCleveland incident\u201d or glitter coming back to bite your ass for the prank on Kevin. It had been a good thing, all those decades before, to stop making glitter from plastic. However, when choosing its replacement, people forgot that glitter is forever. \n\nThey could have made it from small bits of dyed, polished rice, but some politician from Pittsburgh eager to keep the steel mills open made the case for steel glitter to keep blue collar jobs alive. He resigned in disgrace from Congress and died a few years later alone on the banks of the Allegheny after more and more cases like yours cropped up all over the world. Mothers and children being blinded during MRI scans, all because of innocuous specs of steel glitter. \n\n",

I promised the church the whole wedding mess would be cleaned for service the following morning, and here I was more concerned with cleaning this shit up then whisking my wife away...  Oh, and a few weeks later I was ordering a Uhaul and told this story to the employee.  Apparently my wife's friend bought the peanuts there.  He thought her idea was hilarious and said she spent $80 on foam peanuts.  Gotta hand it to her, dedication to a prank, even if she's fucking evil.",
