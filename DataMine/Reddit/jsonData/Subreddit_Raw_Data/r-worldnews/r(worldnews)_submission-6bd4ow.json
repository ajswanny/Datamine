    "body": "Alright folks, let\u2019s do this\u2026\n\nFirst, in order to look at both sides of this argument, you\u2019re going to have to do one of the hardest things you have ever done: divorce yourself from you political ideology.  For one, we have to stop calling things \u2018facts\u2019 before we have enough information to support a thesis from the hypothesis.  I\u2019m only going to exam the information as presented and offer arguments either for or against the presented data.  \n\nThe Story:  https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/trump-revealed-highly-classified-information-to-russian-foreign-minister-and-ambassador/2017/05/15/530c172a-3960-11e7-9e48-c4f199710b69_story.html?utm_term=.dee88fde12c2\n\nMiller and Jaffe\u2019s story states, \u201cPresident Trump revealed highly classified information to the Russian foreign minister and ambassador in a White House meeting last week, according to current and former U.S. officials, who said Trump\u2019s disclosures jeopardized a critical source of intelligence on the Islamic State\u201d\n\nThe President can legally declassify information as he sees fit as noted in Executive Order 12356.\n\nExecutive Order 12356, signed by former President Ronald Reagan in 1982, gave the authority to the official who originally classified information to declassify it. Former President Barack Obama followed up that order with E.O. 13526 in 2009, which adjusted some of the earlier order\u2019s provisions.\n\n\u201cThe official who authorized the original classification, if that official is still serving in the same position and has original classification authority; (2) the originator\u2019s current successor in function, if that individual has original classification authority; (3) a supervisory official of either the originator or his or her successor in function, if the supervisory official has original classification authority; or (4) officials delegated declassification authority in writing by the agency head or the senior agency official of the originating agency,\u201d according to the order.\n\nThe president is the ultimate authority over the intelligence agencies that classify material, meaning Trump can choose to declassify material if he so chooses.  \n\nHas Trump done anything illegal? No.\n\nTrump by executive right can declassify information as he sees fit. Previous administrations have followed formal processes to do just this.  However, without any formal declassification, Trump may have committed either an intentional or unintentional disclosure.  Still, the grey area exists in that is there a formal process required or can it be done \u2018ad hoc\u2019 or \u2018on the fly\u2019?  The President may have created a precedent over anything criminal here.\n\nWas this shared with a known adversary at a terrible time?  The President isn\u2019t known for better judgement when it comes to optics.  This could be a convergence of poor choice.\n\nSome of the complications, are unfortunately more tangible than a lack of discipline, as the impact is deeper than many understand\u2026\nThe Post further adds that the, \u201cinformation the president relayed had been provided by a U.S. partner through an intelligence-sharing arrangement considered so sensitive that details have been withheld from allies and tightly restricted even within the U.S. government, officials said.\u201d  They further note that:\n\nThe partner had not given the United States permission to share the material with Russia, and officials said Trump\u2019s decision to do so endangers cooperation from an ally that has access to the inner workings of the Islamic State. After Trump\u2019s meeting, senior White House officials took steps to contain the damage, placing calls to the CIA and the National Security Agency.\n\n\u201cThis is code-word information,\u201d said a U.S. official familiar with the matter, using terminology that refers to one of the highest classification levels used by American spy agencies. Trump \u201crevealed more information to the Russian ambassador than we have shared with our own allies.\u201d\n\nSo what?  Didn\u2019t we say what he did was legal?  Sure, we did!  \nKeep in mind it\u2019s legal to stone people to death and marry 9 year olds in some nations.  Doesn\u2019t mean someone doesn\u2019t suffer seriously negative ramifications from the choice.\n\nThis information was shared with US Intelligence Agencies under the premise that we would closely safeguard the Intel. It\u2019s not ours to share essentially.\n\nWell, why not?  \n\nThey told us.  Not only because it does irreparable harm to our ability to obtain and action credible Intel from our allies but also because it may have (and with almost absolute certainty) destroyed a valuable Intel chain.\n\nBut no sources or methods were discussed!\n\nThe level of information provided could clearly paint a picture or information that could be inferred from the disclosure.  I don\u2019t have to say that person X told me that someone said Y.  I can tell you where.  I can tell you how. I can tell you when.  I can tell you red shirts or coffee shops were involved.  I can reverse engineer the information to get details from my aggregated information.  It\u2019s not rocket surgery.  There\u2019s a reason such Special Access Program (SAP) Code-word info is often not discussed outside of a handful of people.  It\u2019s called sensitive for a reason.  Thus, he could have never mentioned a source or method and still disclosed enough information to determine the source and method.\n\nI\u2019m still looking for your so what?  Where\u2019s my reason to be outraged other than nation X continues not to like us and we now have a harder time following bad guys??\n\nIf this was human intelligence (HUMINT), and appears to be, that means we had someone INSIDE major terrorist operations.  The ability to access that kind of Intel has been the penultimate goal of our Intel agencies for years.  The magnitude of work it took to accomplish that requires feats most can\u2019t fathom. This information WILL be shared with the Russian\u2019s Intel cohorts \u2013 The Iranians, the Syrians, etc.  Furthermore, this information will expose the sources and methods through which we were operating.  To be blunt, those providing the information are dead \u2013 or will be in short order. (The prior being the most likely).\n\nOkay, people I don\u2019t know are dead.  Still so what?  Doesn\u2019t affect my Carmel Macchiato purchase\u2026 \n\nThis information is a reflection of the stories you\u2019ve been hearing in regards to laptops on flights.  It was credible enough to warrant a ban on those electronics on inbound flights.  Furthermore, there\u2019s emergency discussion now of enacting the same on all domestic US flights.  The threat is real, specific, and credible enough that it required action now.  Without that Intel, somebody\u2019s plane is coming out of the sky.  More importantly, it may be the one careening into your Starbucks right now if we didn\u2019t have that information.",

A few of your usual republicans will make statements suggesting that the reports are concerning. But guess what, they won't actually do anything. \n\n4.

He confirmed that Trump blabbered about the intel and even confirmed that Trump named a specific city. He then ended the press conference by saying Trump wasn't at fault because he didn't even know where the intel had come from because he hadn't been briefed. What a world we're living in!\n\nEDIT 2: Looks like Trumps next boneheaded move already happened.

Our nation is now less safe and individuals are dead simply on the basis of simple conversation with two Russian chaps.\n\nWait, wait, wait - This story was ALREADY in the news!  He told them stuff they already knew!  Not exactly\u2026.Multiple news sources were asked by US Intel agencies NOT to print certain aspects of these stories as they would have provided clues to the information that was being protected.  Our \u2018so called fake news\u2019 heeded the request of our collective best interest and omitted it, where the person specifically charged with it did not.\n\nWell, he\u2019s new.  He doesn\u2019t know any better.  Give him a break!\n\nYou have one of two scenarios here \u2013 this is either an intentional or unintentional disclosure.  If this was an intentional disclosure, then the Commander in Chief was not aware of the depth of the information he provided to our adversaries.  Furthermore, he didn\u2019t understand the ramifications of his actions. In this case, ignorance may be a reason but it\u2019s no excuse.  If it was unintentional, he got played \u2013 hard.  The self-proclaimed master of the \u201cArt of the Deal\u201d just got his backside handed to him because he foolishly thought he was smarter than he was \u2013 hubris and narcissism.  \n\nWorking on the Intel side, I would have done what the Russians likely did.  I would have created a very comprehensive dossier on Trump\u2019s behaviors, mannerisms, likes, dislike and faults.  He has a penchant for bragging and narcissism.  He also is deeply insecure and needs to feel important \u2013 like, two ice cream scoop important.  He\u2019s impulsive and likes to improvise, think he can bluster through a discussion.  In business this may work sometimes, hell\u2026.maybe even a lot of times.  He wasn\u2019t dealing with businessmen\u2026he was dealing with Russian spies.\n\nThey likely used a process of elicitation to encourage Trump to share information he didn\u2019t realize he was sharing.  They played to his enjoyment of sounding important and got him to spill info he shouldn\u2019t have shared.  They did it over handshakes, and he even enjoyed the covert butt reaming he got. If this is the case, he\u2019s grossly incompetent and the most dangerous liability to our national security during our lifetime.\n\nA participant who was there said it didn\u2019t happen!!!\n\nCareful, as words have power \u2013 and this statement is crafted VERY specifically.  The words used and not used are important.  Note what\u2019s omitted and present.\n\nH.R. McMaster, the national security adviser, who participated in the meeting. \u201cAt no time were any intelligence sources or methods discussed, and no military operations were disclosed that were not already known publicly.\u201d\n\nThese statements are true.  However, this is not the crux of the argument made.  There\u2019s no argument being made that this is the case, either by the post or in the news.   McMaster reiterated his statement in a subsequent appearance at the White House on Monday and described the Washington Post story \u201c\u2026as described as false,\u201d but did not take any questions.\n\n\u201cAs described\u201d doesn\u2019t mean there are gaping holes in the story.  It also doesn\u2019t say that the story is patently false.  It\u2019s a non-statement to put spin on an issue while they develop a more cohesive way of addressing the disclosure.   This also speaks to why McMaster gave no comments to the press and left immediately post statement. \n\nWhy would I believe these \u2018sources\u2019 over McMaster who was there?\nThe sources confirm the reports that both the heads of the CIA and NSA were immediately called after the meeting occurred to head off the disclosure.  The recognized what happened and acted immediately.  We can eliminate potential sources and determine that a US source at one of these agencies leaked this information to the Post out of fears the administration would attempt to bury this information.  This information is also credible based on Trump\u2019s mannerisms and history of interaction.  It\u2019s exacerbated by the difficulties the administration has had with messaging after a messy event takes place.  A lack of credibility becomes a cinder block that winds up sinking all of your arguments.\n\nI can continue to elaborate on every aspect of this series of events, but man it continues to be crazy.  I\u2019m still hopeful this is gross incompetence.  The problem is, even if it is\u2026.\n\n\u2026I don\u2019t know how any real patriot can truly believe this is worth of forgetting, fixing, or offering a \u2018do over.\u2019\n\nThis should be a red-line for ALL Americans.\n",

On March 15 he was very clearly proud of the fact that he was reading, saying:\n\n>\u201cWell, you know, I love to read. Actually, I\u2019m looking at a book, I\u2019m reading a book, I\u2019m trying to get started. Every time I do about a half a page, I get a phone call that there\u2019s some emergency, this or that. But we\u2019re going to see the home of Andrew Jackson today in Tennessee and I\u2019m reading a book on Andrew Jackson. I love to read. I don\u2019t get to read very much, Tucker, because I\u2019m working very hard on lots of different things, including getting costs down. The costs of our country are out of control. But we have a lot of great things happening, we have a lot of tremendous things happening.\u201d\n\nWell, after a month and a half he was finally ready to tell us what he had learned from his first attempt at reading a book, saying:\n\n>\u201cHad Andrew Jackson been a little later you wouldn\u2019t have had the Civil War. He was a very tough person, but he had a big heart, and he was really angry that he saw what was happening with regard to the Civil War. He said, \u2018There\u2019s no reason for this.\u2019 \u201d\n\nSo yeah, we are watching the President of the United States try to educate himself on the basic history of our nation, and try to brag about it. I think the second quote comes about from his inability to conceive of various actors moving towards separate goals at the same time, from his unwillingness to be critical of his chosen heroes for the moment, and the overinflated importance he attributes to historical actors of whose names he knows.

I'm sure even Bush Jr is pretty angry right now, maybe even enough to pull him away from his paintings. Get Bush Jr, Clinton, Obama, Carter, and Bush Sr together to denounce this crap, and I think that would send a powerful message. That way Bush Sr and Carter don't have to over exert themselves but they're still present.\n\nFrankly, at this point, I don't think there's gonna be any changing pro-Trump people's minds.

If you declare bankruptcy you can cut your losses (a business can, people not so much, Merica!) and he's had companies go under, read the writing on the wall and moved on. No reason he won't do the same here. And like bankruptcy if and when he resigns he can side step impeachment entirely, shielding him from the redditors of 20 years from now who use him as the third on a short list of no no presidents.

This time I could not in good conscious vote republican.   \n  \nEven if you completely ignore all the Russian ties Trump was a fucking joke candidate that should have never gotten the Republican nomination. Because of this, I voted for the first time against the Republican Party and voted for Bernie and then when that didn't work out I reluctantly voted Clinton.   \n  \n  \nBeing so attached to a particular party instead of your own set of morals is just idiotic beyond belief to me. This isn't football so why is everyone picking teams? He is slowly destroying our country and the complete lack of care by our government to do anything about it is appalling.   \n  \nAt this point I am beginning to lose hope we will ever see an impeachment by a Republican Congress unless the FBI gather so much fucking evidence that there is absolutely 100% beyond a shadow of a doubt treason that they can prove.
