And not for lack of trying, either. Various organizations have been funding study after study trying to find the barest shred of evidence that copyright or patent law achieves any of the social objectives it's meant to. And they've come up dry or, in some cases, demonstrated the opposite. The closest they have ever gotten has been showing that increasing patent protections increases investment in acquiring pharmaceutical patents. We can hem and haw all day about why the results look the way they do, but the data is pretty much in already: copyright law and patent law, in their current incarnations, are not properly serving their purpose. Not only do they fail to increase production of works of art and inventions, in many cases they do the opposite, by standing in the way of creators who can't defend themselves against legal threats.\n\nTrademark law is mostly fine.",

I cited I think 6 or so real studies that showed that piracy had no noticeable effect on profit and that the companies were likely losing money fighting it instead of ignoring it.\n\nThis was for a 3 page paper for my goddamn English II class over 10 years ago. The only reason the crusade against piracy still exists is because company execs go with their gut feeling a 3rd party DRM sales rep is selling them instead of spending the 6 hours I spent researching the topic. And so the real consumers AND the company suffer as a result.\n\nI refused to buy Sonic Mania because they delayed it on PC so they could add DRM to it. I don't want to be treated like a suspect when I'm giving you my money. I don't want to be one of those people the DRM completely fucks up for. I don't want THOSE people to even have that happen because it shouldn't need to.\n\nMost people who pirate cannot or will not buy the thing in question. No matter what. On the other hand, some people pirate because the owning company doesn't take the effort to make their product available. Look at the foreign prices of some of the mainstream titles on Steam - some of them cost a *month* of pay for one game, because the publisher can't be assed to look up the actual information. Some games are just never flagged as sellable in some countries.\n\nYou want to reduce piracy? Pay some non idiot 60k a year or whatever to fix those easy issues.

It's been part of the entertainment business model since records were invented and probably long before that when printing presses were common.\n\nThe reality is that piracy is an advertising platform and a very effective one.  In more recent times, Photoshop would not have gained it's level of market penetration if it wasn't so widely available to students who would never have spent the money on it.  Tons of bands with cult followings never would have developed those followings without bootleg recordings and easy access to their music.  Once those followings develop money gets made, but there's no pretending that they would have developed otherwise.  \n\nThe anti-piracy movement is not about stopping piracy.  It's about controlling market and mind share.  As long as you _think_ the best movies are $100+M blockbusters, you will keep paying $20 to see the latest Tom Cruise movie in the theaters.  \n\nBut the movement comes at a cost.  There was a solid decade when the music industry produced nothing new of any real value.  The 98-08 collection isn't going to produce much of a nostalgic back catalog because there's very little there.  It's lost revenue, but there was a reason and a business plan around it.  There was potential for the entire market to be lost.  Many independents have come around, but the majority of the move and music markets are still controlled by the same companies.\n\n",

    "body": "> copyright law and patent law, in their current incarnations, are not properly serving their purpose\n\nThey are, just not the purpose that the public expects.  Copyright is supposed to be, ultimately, a lien on the natural rights of the public for a limited time (and limited does not mean \"lifetime of so-and-so\" or \"as long as we can bribe Congress to pad it out to,\" more like \"a few years so that people who want to do something with it aren't going to be rotted bones by the time it hits the public domain\") to allow content producers to make money off of their creations, with the end goal being the benefit to the public.\n\nIt stopped being that a long time ago.\n\nAt this point, copyright is about **control** on just about every level.  Specifically, controlling you.  This ranges from a hoped-for end game where you have to rent all the media you watch, to dictating how you do repairs on your tractor (which is already here, see: John Deere tractors and the DRM on their software), to what you can do with your own private property (although they've failed in many instances - resale of cars, jailbreaking/rooting phones - but they keep trying), and probably at some point what you can and cannot do with your computer.  The companies and the government would love that, a computer that you pay for but they own for all intents and purposes.  Only able to do what they permit you to.  And because it has DRM, it's illegal to try to remove the software that does that.  Considering some of the things that have happened with software lately, what with telemetry and the crap that we hear about creeping into our computers (e.g. Intel Management Engine), I wouldn't be a bit surprised if they're trying to creep towards that.\n\nPlus, it's used to retard innovation, as are patents for that matter.  Scientific research behind a paywall where you have to pay $50 just to look at one paper for 24 hours?  Companies that buy up patents so that they can't be produced, sometimes for things that can radically improve people's lives?  Yeah, that's all there.  Again.  Control.\n\nIn truth, it's pretty scary.  Piracy is just one side of it, and it's a very one-dimensional side at that, at least if you listen to the line you're being fed.  Heck, piracy doesn't even go into the fact that in a lot of cases the work really should have become public domain after a few years, if we were paying attention to the Constitution.\n\nAnd ultimately, nobody is going to pay any attention to it until it's gone completely out of control and is likely baked into most of our technology, even though it's slowly creeping in all around us.",

They played with pricing in the study and found as soon as they attached any price the usage dropped by something like 80%, even when the price was as low as a few cents.

Second, pirates consume the media and talk about it in their social circles, giving it greater exposure and more weight than a traditional ad campaign could. For example, you are probably going to be more likely to see a movie that your friends rave about than one that you've only seen ads for.",

This was pre-youtube!  So I went to their gigs and bought their merchandise. You can't download an experience or a t-shirt! So for the loss of the cost of an album, they have gained 100s in concert fees and merchandising. Plus... Album sales because I want to support the artists.\n\nNow don't get me started on the film industry.......!",

But of course, it can still be abused by stronger parties.\n\nI've heard lots of stories like this. Companies know what they can get away with. It's part of their business strategy. One guest speaker came to talk about his ten year and still ongoing battle with MS over a stolen idea. He wasn't fighting because it was worth it, but for the principle. He knew that MS can take inventions with near impunity. Almost no one fights back, and those who do get crushed, or they just give up. Who wants to spend their whole life fighting that battle? But he didn't want to just let them get away with it. So the fight goes on.",

    "body": "It's a complicated mixed bag.\n\nMost musical acts are a loss for the record companies, once you account for the costs of production and promotion(whether that be with music videos or plain old advertising).\n\nThe ones that they do make money on are used to finance the new acts, and hopefully a handful of those will turn into succesful acts to finance the next wave of new acts and whatnot.\n\nThe situation where that is not necessary is when they can take a more or less \"guarranteed\" act: one that already has a significant local following and has self-promoted and created a real following.\n\nThis is certainly changing, and some artists are eschewing the need for a record company, recording by themselves and promoting through social media and word of mouth. But lets be real: the vast majority of succesful acts still come through the \"old ways\".\n\nThe \"new way\" with digital distro has apple and google taking a huge cut for doing nearly nothing. Or with platforms like spotify it pays the artists pennies. It's great for consumers because it's super cheap but it really does not help to actually finance the signing on of new artists.\n\nI'm not saying the old ways are good or the new ways are bad, I just think that this is all a bit more nuanced than what we consumers see on the surface.\n\nConsider this: say before that you had a thousand music fans that used to spend from 10-200 a month on music(say $30,000). And now they all just sub to spotify($10,000), that's three times less money  going into the industry. Then the question becomes of where that money goes.\n\nWith spotify it goes towards dev costs, server costs, profits, and licensing costs(which are ultimately handed off to the record companies or artists). With old media it gets diced off to retail stores, distributors, physical media production costs, with the remnants going to the record company or artists.\n\nI'd contend that new media probably has a higher ratio of the consumer spent money going to artists, but it has a lower lump sum that reaches them.  It's more \"efficient\" but it also has less money reaching the recording industry so fewer loss leaders on which to finance new acts, and thus an increased need for independence and \"self-production\" from acts to make it big. That could be a good or bad thing. But it's certainly not as simple as \"digital age good, old age bad\". Though for the consumers, at least as far as the cost of music it is good. But the quality/variety may suffer, and it may be bad for musicians who have little leverage.",

You don't get that money back and until then you are at the mercy of any price rises they want to make if you want to maintain access to your collection.\n\nPeople argue that the monthly fee isn't too high.. But they don't offer a full library of music. If you want access to all music there are more and more competing sites like Tidal  all locking in their own list of exclusive labels or artists diluting the market.\n\nThis really erodes the value of the fee each  individual service charges. The same is happening with TV shows. \n\nIs not realistic to subscribe to all of the providers for most people and you end  by subscribing you only encourage this kind of market.  More competition = higher fees paid to lock in exclusive shows = higher sub fees to cover this. In the end everyone ends up paying more for a worse quality product. \n\nHow can do many people live such a flawed model for the user. \nAnd they wonder why piracy is still a thing?\n\n",

Music and Video Games for the most part have been through this battle a decade ago and come out the other side just fine. Hell, video game production is even more expensive than movies sometimes.  \n\nI don't understand why film and TV can't catch up with the times. Netflix was a good start but now that keeps hitting roadblocks too with accessibility, location specific content and licensing bullshit etc.... \n\nHere's a fucking awesome example. TV show called Bosch. It's an Amazon show. So as far as I can tell it's owned and produced by Amazon. I got Amazon Prime TV... it's pretty good. Not as big as Netflix but there's other benefits....probably even better if you're in the US. \n\nSo I watch Season 1 and Season 2 earlier this year or late last year. Then Season 3 comes along (I think it was April). I don't use Amazon as often as Netflix so I didn't notice until a few months ago. OK no worries. Jump on and go to watch it.... \"Not available in your country (Australia)\".  WTF?   \nTurns out that instead of keeping their own fucking show on their own service, Amazon sold Season 3 (and only season 3) to SBS which is a local Australian channel. Of course, it's now September and there is zero information on when the season will even air. There's literally no information about what's happening with Season 3 locally, 5 months after the US release. Maybe it's already aired? No idea. And by the way, i had to go hunting for this lack of information since Amazon just says \"not available\" and provide no other explanation.     \n\nSo I can't even pay for a service and watch that service's original content anymore. WTF is the point of paying for it?   \nNeedless to say I've already watched Season 3 through other means. Stop making it so fucking hard to pay you for the product or service that I want!!! ",

    "body": "> Why do so few games these days have demos?\n\nI have a few theroies. One is it caused a decline in sales. I know personally in the past (many many years ago) I would be excited for the fall releases and start writing a Christmas list. Then I'd get a demo disc or play demos at the store or on my PC and it would cause me to cross games off my list because I didn't like them. \n\nIn the early days of the internet. Less reputable but popular gaming sites would play the demo and write a review based on that and hurt sales. \n\nThe biggest reason I tihnk they're gone is cost, for two sub reasons. \n\nOne - it costs money to make a demo and \n\nTwo -  it cost money to make a demo of a near complete game and ship an actually finished game. \n\nNow it's cheaper to ship an unfinished game to get some incoming revnue and then publish an update.",

Only time I noticed shit disappear was when I couldn't watch Code Lyoko, Doctor Who, and Avatar: The Last Airbender.\n\nHonestly, it's getting really annoying. They hiked the price up but they keep losing content to other streaming services like Amazon, Hulu, and Crunchyroll. I got netflix so I could just chill and watch shit, but if it keeps getting removed what's the point? You already have to wait a shitload of time for a shows season to update on it, and while that isn't really their fault, it's making me a bit jaded about the service as a whole.",
