    "body": "Reports like this always make me wonder where they're getting the \"street value\" of whatever was confiscated/stolen/intercepted.  Generally, such reports are about drugs, and having done the math in the past when a major shipment gets intercepted by the police, there seems to be a tendency to inflate the street value (at least based on the price that I get...from...Google...and other sites).\n\nThere are 32,000 ounces to a US ton...20 tons comes to 640,000 ounces.  That gives us 19,104 33.5-ounce jars of Nutella.  One such jar costs $6.64 at Walmart (according to Walmart.com), so 19,104 such jars comes to $126,850.56, meaning Walmart's making a profit of nearly $47,000 off 20 tons of Nutella, and the police are using the wholesale value of Nutella (does it come in 55 gallon drums!?  OH DEAR LORD), or the police simply have no idea how much Nutella goes for...\n\n",

The problem is that it's produced in countries like Indonesia with few environmental protections and farmers just drive into the rainforest and clear hectares upon hectares to grow palm trees.
