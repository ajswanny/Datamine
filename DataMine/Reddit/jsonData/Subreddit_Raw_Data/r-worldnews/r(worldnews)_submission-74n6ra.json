There were still old power poles leaning left and right, places where downed wires were buried only to punch out of the dirt again onto these rickety poles for a few miles or meters, then in weird boxes where it looked like they'd been patched together and covered, and on an on. And that is just the electrical distribution system.\n\nBut a large part of any power restoration project will have to be donated or loaned to Puerto Rico. With little natural exports, beyond tourism which is seasonal, Puerto Rico will not be able to repay any loan of any real size. Plus, there's the hidden problems of money mismanagement by government officials because some people are assholes.\n\nWhat's the solution? Probably make them a state. Then slowly work to rebuild in a modern grid using renewable where possible. Elon Musk is certainly ambitious, but this will come down to dollars and cents.\n\nEDIT: As I responded below -\n\n[Federal Infrastructure and Transportation Budget](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=3&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwjymrDKmtzWAhVU5GMKHTUPCkkQFggzMAI&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cbo.gov%2Ftopics%2Finfrastructure-and-transportation&usg=AOvVaw1ynOv66ogMh0bA_yP94lq1).

My local utility is solar/grid-tied friendly.\n\nMost people say that \"it takes 2123123 years to pay for itself...\". \n\nThey are looking at it the wrong way. As soon as the panels go on my house, the equity in my house goes up. I'm spending around ~$20k in panels and my house is likely to be worth $10-20k more since it will reduce any potential buyer/renter's electricity bill by ~$150/month.\n\nLoan is zero down 12 years (solar companies offer 10-20 year 2-4% loans for ownership).\n\nSo the cliff notes are I spend a little bit more per month (10-20$ total). However, with that little extra, the remaining ~$150/month is coming back to me rather than being burned (spent money). \n\nThe bottom line, the solar system will put around $30-50k into my retirement in 20 years. This is all for about 1 day (8 hours) worth of work on my part. This investment is better than most real-estate investments.\n\nTLDR: If you own your house, and your local utility is solar friendly, solar makes financial sense.",

He had to light up the town as part of that contract.

A typical scenario would be the seller taking into consideration that the local consumer can't pay, would go to the PR gov't and negotiate a deal along  \"we give you the equipment, and you will pay $xx for for XX years for each user\". Had PR gov't bought the equipment outright, the cost would have been $x. But by letting the seller extend terms over a long period of time, the seller will make 10-50 times more than the original sale price. Once the deal is inked, the seller can sell that contract out on the open market for 60-95% of the value of the contract and get his money back with profit right away.\n\nNot always the most altruistic thing, but that's how this deal can be done. \n\nEdit: wow, this blew up my box. So as for PR default rate, unless you're living under a rock, everyone is aware of it. That's not a problem. There are entire industries  built upon customers bad credit.  Any \"rent to own\" or \"buy here, pay here \" woks on the same principle. Actually any loan takes into account the consumer's ability to repay. If you have a credit rating of 800+, you'll have loan with very little interest charges, but if you under 600, you'll probably pay very high interest rate.\n\nIf I were part of the team to negotiate this deal, one element I would incorporate in the deal is  all oil/natural gas resources' rights in PR territorial waters.

Germany set out to be less grid dependent and have come a long way since the 90\u2019s. \n\nI\u2019m not expecting Puerto Rico will be revolutionized overnight.  But they can start making better/more robust energy decisions that will harden them from future large scale outages.  That is what Elon is offering and what Puerto Rico is entertaining.  They are not Germany, and will need to strategize specific to their needs.  Imagine for example, in the first year they atleast have off grid \u201cenergy hotspots\u201d every five miles where electricity can be utilized for those in need? Enough to charge batteries, etc.   Imagine at the very least Puerto Rico investing in renewable energy so their hospitals can act as their own power plants?  At the very least ICUs?  There were ICUs where everyone died as a result of losing power and running out of fuel on backup generators...\n\n...whatever they come up with, it will take time.  Value can also be generated out of using renewables, which in turn could have a positive effect on PR\u2019s economy in the long run.  They would be foolish not to look into it...even if it takes decades to be more grid independent.",

In the fourth quarter of 2016, solar installations were 201 MW, down from 272 MW a year earlier. Full-year 2016 installations were 803 MW, down from 870 MW a year earlier. \n\n>As late as third-quarter 2016 earnings results, SolarCity's management expected the company to keep growing. They guided for 900 MW in full-year installations, implying around 300 MW of installs for the fourth quarter. Once Tesla took control, the number of installations dropped -- and the future for the business doesn't look much better. \n\n...\n\n>A recent study by the National Renewable Energy Lab (NREL) showed that quotes from large, national installers were priced $0.33, or about 10%, higher than smaller local or regional installers. And as customers move toward more loan and cash sales versus leases and loans, the advantage national installers had with scale is dissipating. \n\n>Tesla's newly acquired solar unit may actually have higher costs than competitors, and it doesn't have a differentiated product, either. \n\n...\n\n>Now, it appears the solar panels Tesla has introduced are just rebranded Panasonic panels. And with Panasonic running the Buffalo plant -- dubbed \"Gigafactory 2\" -- Tesla doesn't have a new or differentiated product at all. It's just installing Panasonic panels. \n\nhttp://www.businessinsider.com/teslas-solar-business-is-largely-a-bust-2017-4?r=US&IR=T",

They transferred the tech and custom tools to do that to Tesla Motors, who used that on their aluminum bodied vehicles (Model S and Model X, not the 3) to make them much stronger than a normally welded piece. As a result, the S and X have some of the highest safety ratings for impacts of any vehicles ever tested by the NTHSA. Then there is OpenAI, his startup for AI who just gave one of their top researchers out \"on loan\" to Tesla for the self driving car division. There are a dozen other examples of this.
