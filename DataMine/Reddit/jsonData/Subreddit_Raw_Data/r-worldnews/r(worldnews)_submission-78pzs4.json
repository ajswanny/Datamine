It's not all robber barons and shit. \n\nEdit:  The argument in the lsc sub was this:  capitalism has no shot at saving humanity at all.  I pointed out Musk's work and was shouted down, due to Musk \"just having a space fetish\".  The reason doesn't matter.  If the guy is making renewable storage energy cheap for everyone, he can do it for a ladies shoe fetish for all I care.  The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has done great work at limiting HIV/AIDS in Africa, which would not have been done without capitalist dollars.  TOMS is giving away shoes.  Many many instances and becoming more and more commonplace. Are there tax incentives, sure.  But I think there is a new way of looking at things when it comes to business.  The old models of slash and burn are not sustainable.  And one viral tweet about good guy so and so is much more effective advertising than super bowl campaigns.  Humanitarianism does not fall into any specific political or social ideology.  I'm just glad that companies like Tesla exist today to pick up the slack. ",

Some small firm connected to corrupt officials wins the government order for some work without competition (easily done by making some specific requirements and no time to prepare offer while that firm magically have everything prepared the same day). It hires subcontractors, pays them much less and keeps the difference. Profit. \n\nMore advanced schemes include owned subcontractors where you can hide more money and spend less. \n\nIt doesn't mean work won't be done. It probably would. Just slower and with much worse quality (less workforce, cheaper materials etc). \n\nEDIT: Hmmm, lots of experts in Russian corruption schemes who are also happen to be Trump supporters say in comments I'm wrong and full of shit.

L\u00fcbeck started that way when the sovereign of the city went bankrupt and the merchants of the city bought out the city. Within 5 years it was safer, well lit and more prosperous than it had ever been before. The Hanseatic league then spread accross the Baltic and signed free trade agreements with all the major trading cities in Europe at the time: Bruges, London, etc.\n\nIn the modern age, Singapore would be a pretty good example, among a few others. The country is run like a corporation, and it's run very efficiently, especially if you consider that it was a third-world country only 60 years ago (one of the poorest in the world at that). Yes, there are some rather extreme laws (death penalty for drug smuggling, and short prison time for things like spitting chewing gum on the pavement, that kind of thing) but the country has made fantastic progress and is well on its way to being the wealthiest in the world per capita. Taxes are pretty much based on a freemium model: extremely low for the first couple of hundred thousand dollars (like a couple of hundred dollars). Despite this, education is top notch, public services, hospitals, etc. all top of the league.\n\n",

But this is a phenomenon that occurs in all accelerated emergent economies. \n\nThink about it: in year x everyone is poor to the point of famine; in year x+50 a minority of people is still very poor but there's a very large middle-class and some people have done extremely well from the economic boom. Result: the disparity between the people who haven't changed in 50 years and those who have done very well is a few orders of magnitude.",

I also read that low and no cost assistance was offered by many utility companies under an existing framework for mutual aid, but ultimately rejected.

The military service = citizenship thing makes sense in the story (That's not to say it would be a good/uncontroversial idea in reality). Mostly though it's the only sci fi book I've read where they managed to make powered armour sound really cool, and the audio book version has an *amazing* narrator.",

My apologies: it constantly gets used as an example for how crazy some laws are, so it's easy to forget. \n\nIt's undeniable, however, that there is a disproportionate jailtime for very small offences. You *will* go to jail for riding a [scooter](https://www.decathlon.co.uk/media/835/8352913/big_c4c9a1758d5e404d81214cdba8a3e6fd.jpg) on the road instead of the pavement: one of my best friends just did a few weeks ago, multinational foreign companies constantly have a problem with staff being sent to jail for tiny offences because their company policy says you mustn't have a criminal record.\n\nHaving said that, I'm actually very much in awe for the way Singapore manage to run things.
