But it was a very rare case, the main examples were ISPs prioritizing VOIP packets to improve call quality. No one was discriminating between http traffic of different websites.\n\n- Bandwidth caps and \"zero-rated services\": this is what is actually going to kill net neutrality. Only [India has a law against it](https://www.stuff.co.nz/technology/76695738/India-just-banned-zero-rated-Facebook-We-should-too), and it was very controversial. As of recently, [Canada is still reviewing the situation](http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/crtc-review-differential-pricing-zero-rating-1.3623026). \n\nWhen 4k video becomes the norm, and your ISP keeps the same \"1tb/month\" data cap from 10 years ago; but their video streaming service is exempt from those datacaps, that's when competition dies. \n\nBut no one will want to make that illegal, because to most people, they are getting it \"for free\".",

Unfortunately, gerrymandering hamstrings most congressional districts. A couple turn blue, but not many. Fox news is in full propaganda mode, blasting any dem with a chance. More fake news. Fabricated scandals, maybe even fictitious sexual assault scandals as revenge for Roy Moore. A couple Senate seats turn blue, but Republicans manage to retain their slim majority. \n\n2019- the economy starts tanking hard. media becomes more consolidated and more politicized. They blame the dems. The liberals. The left. The socialists. Until anyone who disagrees with the status quo is a branded as part of the economic problems. The Pedes eat it up. Outlets that criticize the president have their broadcast privileges suspended. Bad! Universities are branded as mutineer-mills. \"profiteering vultures take money away from young people, brain wash them into liberal idiots and send them out into the world with a worthless degree and thousands of dollars in debt. No more!\" thus, free thought dies a little more.\n\n\n2020- trump establishes a new, national police force that searches for seditious elements. \"According to the browser history your isp handed over to us, and the text messages you sent to your brother, we'd like to take you to our special prison and have a few words with you.\"\n\n\nIt's a crime to criticize the Republican party and the president. More and more opposing politicians face unheard of lawsuits. Some are fined. Some of the crazy ones are jailed. Hell, maybe even Hillary gets locked up finally. \"no one us above the law. She had this coming for years and I promised you I would jail her and so I have.\"\n\n\n2021- the borders close. No one in. No one out. Unless your being shipped overseas for the war effort. The border wall helped tremendously. \n\nAs the deficit hawks so quickly reversed their decision when it was politically convenient for them to change their tune, so do the 2nd amendment fundamentalists. As gun violence increases and attacks on politicians and even law enforcement become less unusual, It becomes imperative to disarm an increasingly disgruntled population. \n\n\n2022- Conveniently, a new terrorist attack occurs on US soil or an earthquake, or some sort of tragedy on a grand scale. The US goes to war with somebody. Doesn't matter who. Trump's approval rating inches up. \n\n\nElections are suspended until the active threat to our freedom is resolved. Republicans are deeply concerned, very troubled, but what choice do they have? Risk letting a Democrat unseat the very unpopular president signing their bills? Concerned politicians and people are outraged. There are lawsuits. Unfortunately trump has been stacking the courts with loyalists and hacks. The courts side with trump. Elections are too unpredictable at such a dangerous time\n\n\n\n\"people wouldn't let that happen here.\"\n\n\n\"we would stop it before it ever got *that* far.\"\n\n\n\"maybe this could happen other places but not in *america*\"\n\n\n\"but we're a free society!\"\n\n\n\"but we're better than that.\"\n\n\n\n\"that could never happen here.\"\n\n\nMotherfucker, it already is. Everybody knows with absolute certainty it could never happen to them, to their country, to their home. Until it does. The slide into autocracy is slow and incremental but accelerating nonetheless. I suggest you all find your lines in the sand and ACT when they're crossed. ",

I feel like this, and everything else the current administration is doing, is bad for America... but possibly good for the rest of the world. We are basically shutting down and turning inward right when the rest of the world is expanding and intermingling. This weakens US influence as countries now feel emboldened to alter their course from ours. They are starting to realize that they don't have much to fear from the US and that they can do these things on their own. Every mistake we make like this is reducing the US influence in the world. The last global recession sped up efforts to get other countries off the US dollar for the reserve currency. The US being divided internally on drug policy, and medical marijuana in particular, is causing other countries to finally ignore the US and create their own drug policies. The US is canceling treaties that keep other countries working with them and toward their goals. The US is shifting focus away from clean energy and environmental regulations when the rest of the world is convinced they need to happen. \n\nThese are all huge generalizations, but I feel like they show a major shift overy time in US global power and influence. If you take yourself out of all interesting conversations and policies, you are irrelvant. All we will be left with is military power, which only takes you so far once you have given up all your economic and social standing. The US has some major issues, but I still think they are a better option of a world power than either Russia or China. ",

Not just from a policy standpoint, but fundamental values of taking care of others and environment etc.\n\nSure India is dirty as hell, but there is a strong sense of nationalism and love for their world. Especially with programs like swacch bharat resulting in IMMEDIATE change, and attempts at stifling corruption, they\u2019re all aghast at the fact that they\u2019ve looked up to the US (India was still kinda old school and shitty in terms of tech and development through easily ~2006-2008) for so long and now it\u2019s regressing.\n\nThe US has done a great job of leading up to this point, but stagnancy and ignorance are going to put us behind the pack. We\u2019re already trailing on multiple quality and health metrics (I\u2019m in healthcare), and now basic freedoms are under fire. Family friends are now slowly starting to reconsider coming to the US for education as well, which is a TRAVESTY. This country has been built and developed on immigrants from literally day 1, 1496 and 1776 onwards. Nowadays the core \u201cAmericans\u201d have become so stagnant and complacent that they don\u2019t want to even deal with the competition of others who want to truly be here. Nah, instead they sit on them and tax them, whether they be poor immigrants or intelligent grad students, and then they shit on them. \n\nUnless there is a cultural change (slowly happening hopefully?), this country is fucking done.\n\nPersonal opinion, I love it here, but fuck the US. We might have a ton of money, but we don\u2019t give a shit about our fellow citizens and the culture is getting increasingly toxic. Younger generations are fighting against it, but older generations have already tried to fuck them and enslave them (artificial demand for College and now increasing number of young people are enslaved in the form of debt).",

If \"racists\" were electing \"nazis\" then obama never would have won in a landslide twice in a row. Theres racists but theres very very few of them and they have no political power.\n\nThis racist hysteria is just another way to divide america and destroy it from within. Nobody benefits from the leftwing's hysteria than russia and china. Who do you think would benefit the most if the US descended into civil war and came out as an anarcho-communist state? RUSSIA AND CHINA.\n\nThe truth is, multinational conglomerates that dont see themselves as part of any nation, who see themselves above all nations, are the ones who are engineering this. They dont care about the US or any other country. All they care about is controlling mountains of people, and they corrupt our governemnts and stack our media to do it.",

Innovative future tech like Fusion has been sluggish recently, now being overtaken by China and Europe.\n\nHaving such a reliance on private innovation, at that being a handful of major companies, it mandates that the US provide overly generous incentives to accommodate these companies. Now government institutions, like NASA, are no longer at the forefront of innovation but more like middlemen between competing corporate interests. \n\nThe US is currently cornering itself into a very dependent economic relationship.

Things were pretty rosy in the 90s, with a domestic economic boom and the fall of the Soviet Union. Things started going downhill after 9/11 and the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. I know it might seem like a long time ago for some, but all of this occurred *less* than two decades ago. Then came the burst of the housing bubble, the meltdown on Wall Street and the global recession of 2007-2008.\n\nThat is, unless of course you're trying to stretch things as far back as the Nixon administration. That's kind of a stretch, because the US was still at its peak power. China was still under Mao Zedong and reeling from the Cultural Revolution, not yet the world's factory and economic powerhouse it is today (or was in ancient times). Up and coming powers of the present like India and Brazil were much further down the totem pole than where they sit in today's world. This was well before the 1993 Treaty of Maastricht and the creation of the Eurozone, the European Economic Community being a significant economic block but nothing like the well-integrated behemoth that is today's European Union. The East-West division of Europe into NATO and the Warsaw Pact during the Cold War stifled such growth.\n\nTruly, the only power worth comparing to the US in the latter half of the 20th century would be the Soviet Union. The US is still the global hegemon and, militarily speaking, more powerful and more capable than any other country, but it now belongs to a world with rising regional competitors. This trend will continue, especially in favor of the EU and China, and to a lesser extent India and Brazil.",
