They discontinued that model because \"people were opting for longer range models\". I get that he needs to make money, but thats a shitty \"upgrade\". It's like paid DLC for games.

Look at Puerto Rico. Look how much money we can save the government. Look how much money we can save the people. If this technology can power Puerto Rico immediately following a huge disaster, than think about what it could do for your house, your town, your city, your state...think about what it could do for the whole country\"\n\nYep definitely a PR \"stunt\" but probably one of the most well intentioned PR stunts I've seen on so many levels.\n\n\nSolar batteries need to be scooped up more aggressively by the market so the price of them can get driven down even further (3000-3500 is a great investment already but it could be better so people could also better afford solar panels to go with it and take them completely off the grid) \n\nElon Musk is my goddamn hero!

Certainly \"doable\" in an island of 9000km^2 assuming there's that much undeveloped suitable terrain.

So you're talking 2-5 times the panels/batteries to cover periods of continual overcast (because PV cells generate a tiny fraction of their rated power in those conditions).\n\nSo realistically Musk is sending billions of dollars worth of gear over?  \n\nYa I didn't think so.  \n\nIn reality a few 100 panels and a couple of power walls makes for great PR but not \"a great PR.\"",

Sounds a little callous, but this is an amazing stroke of luck for Tesla.\n\nAn entire ~~country~~ territory needs new power infrastructure from the ground up, *now*. How often does that happen? This is such an unlikely opening that gives them an opportunity to showcase exactly how their products can work at scale. It'll be their first time building out such infrastructure at scale.\n\nIt's part of a nearby unincorporated US territory, so logistics of setting up infrastructure there are much easier than for other countries. It's also isolated from the United States enough that there won't be a huge amount of visibility into their project outside of what they choose to share.\n\nIt's also humanitarian aid. It's not just good PR, any money they spend here is  going to have lots of tax advantages.\n\nTesla just turned their first large-scale test of their power infrastructure into a safely controlled test in their back yard that is tax deductible and amazing PR.",

All by simply harnessing energy that is common, constant, and abundant, unlike solar and wind which are not constant sources.\n\nIt's the same premise as geothermal heating units you can have installed in your home, except it uses a much larger temperature difference and on a larger scale.\n\nThe only reservation Tesla had in his design plans was in reference to drilling the pipelines necessary for such a large scale plant, which back in his day required a massive amount of manual labor.\nHowever, with modern technology today we now have tunnel boring machines which quite literally dig tunnels exactly like those mentioned in his designs.\n\nIn fact, Musk just somewhat recently announced his Boring company which plans to produce highly advanced tunnel boring machines exactly like those would be needed for Tesla's power plants...

When power is needed the tank is released, pulling the cable back out, spinning the generator up as the tank rises to the surface.

Solar, wind, geothermal, all of it 100%. By that measure, we're still at type 0, but may see Type 1 in the next hundred years or so.\n\nType 2 can capture and use all of the energy from their home star. All of it, not just solar panels on all of the orbiting planets. That's why people are talking about building massive, freakin huge spheres, rings, or swarms of artificial platforms around the sun in a Dyson (thing). That idea is to be able to capture all of the energy of our sun, which is a very large amount of energy.\n\nType 3 is another theoretical civilization but at the next step up, capturing all of the energy of a Galaxy. If the Type 2 civilization are like gods to us today, a type 3 would be something that we can't really even imagine. \n\nWe have a very long way before we can worry about that.",

The method stores energy in the form of gravitational potential energy of water, pumped from a lower elevation reservoir to a higher elevation. Low-cost surplus off-peak electric power is typically used to run the pumps. During periods of high electrical demand, the stored water is released through turbines to produce electric power. Although the losses of the pumping process makes the plant a net consumer of energy overall, the system increases revenue by selling more electricity during periods of peak demand, when electricity prices are highest.\n\n> Pumped-storage hydroelectricity allows energy from intermittent sources (such as solar, wind) and other renewables, or excess electricity from continuous base-load sources (such as coal or nuclear) to be saved for periods of higher demand.[1][2] The reservoirs used with pumped storage are quite small when compared to conventional hydroelectric dams of similar power capacity, and generating periods are often less than half a day.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pumped-storage_hydroelectricity",

    "body": "rarity can mean a dozen things, when it comes to digital media.  One could be that the original thing was rare, but the digital copy is readily available, and thus people might've missed it at the time (Holy Diver, the NES/Famicom title, or Radiant Silvergun, the Saturn title, are good examples of this).  It might be that a specific encode or version is less common (Demo versions/radio versions, instead of album versions, for example), and thus counted as rare.  \n\nI see it a lot when a file is excluded from a \"standard\" archive, but other collectors/hoarders keep it for completion's sake.  This becomes important in speedrunning, where version control is essential for some bugs/tactics/timings/etc.  Another example for this is when older stuff is discovered and added to these archives, they'll be marked rare in order to *cause* this rarity to disperse.\n\nIt's also used when there's no retail/legal version of a file available, such as games like Scott Pilgrim vs. The World (never released in hard copy, not available anymore in soft copy, and systems containing the game can go for hundreds more than otherwise similar systems).  The game was fairly common and well known, but getting it *now* becomes more difficult because of how and where it was released.\n\nAnd this is before things that are just marketing tactics (I saw a pirate trying to sell a digital copy of my book, and flagging it \"rare!  New fantasy novel!\"... which seems absurd).",

Or perhaps the internet gives rarity an entirely new perspective. Maybe something is rare when it is hard to find online? Let\u2019s say I download a rare mixtape on zippyshare that you weren\u2019t able to find. I could send it to you, making it easy for you to access, but it would still be rare since I had to show you how to get there. You\u2019ve asked a difficult question, my brother.

Inevitably, we will already have an extensive dyson swarm far before any attempts are made at a monolithic dyson \"ring\".\n\nWhat I think is most likely is that we will gradually fill in the equatorial plane around a few popular distances from the sun with individual satellites and habitats. As they get to be numerous enough we will begin tethering nearby ones together. This connection of tethers between habitats would function as roads between them, along which additional cities could be built, and the network of connections could extend to more existing habitats in that orbit. Gradually these thin wires connecting habitats expand into major multi-lane \"highways\" and urban sprawl from existing habitats extends along them. Fast forward a few dozen centuries, and you have \"grown\" a dyson over time from a billion habitats that didn't *intend* to do any anything so grand, but just found it the most economical option at the time.",

(some people picture dyson spheres you could walk on, but that is a very very silly idea. theoretically you could rotate one fast enough to effectively emulate gravity, but not only would that take an insane amount of energy and require insane super-materials to avoid falling apart, but it would also not apply gravity equally to the whole sphere, with the equator being earth-like and the poles having no gravity at all. as a result even if you did rotate it you would effectively only have a ring of living space anyway. (this is why dyson rings are better than spheres. since they can have uniform gravity, and you can just build more of them until the star is enclosed anyway cylinders are better in this regard mainly because they are not flat, giving you much more surface area to use).\n\nThe other thing is that dyson swarms are much _much_ easier to build, since the process of constructing them is just building more and more space habitats, which is something you would be doing anyway long before you had the technology to construct a sphere. (the resource requirements for a sphere are insane, so we would definitely run out of planetary space before we met them if we weren't also living in space (that's not even getting into planet-mining, since a dyson sphere basically requires stellar lifting anyway, so you don't really need to take apart the planets (you might need to *move* them out of the way though, depending on how you do it))",

That said, its a hassle. Particularly as you'd need to be very careful in the pattern you fired those jets in order to prevent causing harmonic effects that will rip the structure to pieces (a la a wineglass vibrating until it shatters).\n\nDyson swarms avoid all of these issues, since you can just put each part in a stable orbit, and if one falls out of orbit, it's not connected to its neighbours.",

Here is the video he did on [stellar lifting](https://youtu.be/pzuHxL5FD5U), he also has videos about [dyson swarms/rings/spheres](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlmKejRSVd8) and other megastructures (like [matrioshka brains](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ef-mxjYkllw)) that you can find on his channel. he normally goes reasonably in depth on his explanations of things without getting to the point where you drown in it, I highly recommend him.",
