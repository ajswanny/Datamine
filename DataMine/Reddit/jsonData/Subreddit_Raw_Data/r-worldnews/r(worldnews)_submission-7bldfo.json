You might not like the source and there is obviously an element of selective editing/manipulation (e.g., the music), but it made me wonder what the news would look like if the mainstream media ***wanted*** to paint Trump in a positive light.

A few indulgences later and it's much worse than what he started out with. Maybe he started punishing people who tried to stop him. The means might be harsh, but the end result is utopia. Anyone trying to stop utopia are evil, so shutting them down is good and just. \n\nTo go back to them holocaust comparison, exterminating the jews wasn't exactly plan A. Other options were tried first to deal with \"the Jewish problem\", as they called it. If you look at how the nazi situation developed, it really doesn't seem like this was the result of some evil agenda. Rather, it seems that evil eventually just happened, because evil was allowed to happen.\n\n\nEdit: there are a lot of people replying to this comment with very flimsy evidence of the evil nazi plan. THIS IS DANGEROUS. How do you think people turn into holocaust deniers? When they see that some of the things they've been taught about the nazis are incorrect, they're more likely to to conclude that the rest is false as well. It's like the first time you smoke weed and discover it's nothing close to as bad as what they teach you in school. It just makes you question everything you've heard about other drugs as well. \n\nThere's no reason to make the nazis appear worse than they were. Reality should be more than horrifying enough.\n\n",

Helping Trump get elected was their way of destabilizing the political environment in the US and it's working wonderfully. Don't forget that they also promoted Black Lives Matter and Antifa events because they too are organizations that destabilize the political climate.

It's simplistic but enlightening nonetheless.\n\nThe book it's based on is good, too: [The Dictator's Handbook](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11612989-the-dictator-s-handbook).\n\nIt's based on [selectorate theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selectorate_theory), and it isn't just about autocrats - the entire point is that both the most totalitarian autocrats and the most liberal democrats are covered by the same rules.  The only difference is the size of the coalition that keeps them in power.\n\nIt's a good antidote to naive people with dreams of \"benign\" dictatorship.  Autocrats are more or less compelled (on pain of replacement or worse) to disproportionately benefit the small group that keeps them in power, at the expense of everyone else.  And the small group that keeps them in power experiences the same pressure - take as much as possible, become as powerful as possible, eliminate as many competitors as possible, because otherwise some other greedy ruthless asshole will replace *you*.\n\nThe same pressures exist in democracies, but since the winning coalition is bigger, the benefits get spread out further and are harder to condense.  Of course, the winning coalition tends to be quite small even in modern western \"democracies\", but it's still better than it just being goons with guns.",

    "body": "That's one of the big differences when hearing and watching them. I always felt that Bush truly believed in what he was doing, truly believed it was the right thing to do, and hoped he could convince you too. Trump talks like he is looking for applause, cheers, ratings, views, likes, retweets, upvotes, etc. He's just pandering to the audience. And during his rambling pandering he manages to convince himself that he is right, and he knows he is right because he's the one who said it and people liked it. Bush formed decisions and expressed them to the nation. Trump spews as much nonsense at his pep rallies as possible, takes note of what gets the most applause, and uses that to form his decisions. It's all backwards.",
