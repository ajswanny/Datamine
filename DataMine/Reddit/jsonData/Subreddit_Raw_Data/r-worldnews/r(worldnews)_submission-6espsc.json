    "body": ">Trump announced during a speech at the White House Rose Garden that he had decided to pull out of the landmark climate deal, in part because it would not reduce global temperatures fast enough to have a significant impact.\n\n>\"Even if the Paris Agreement were implemented in full, with total compliance from all nations, it is estimated it would only produce a two-tenths of one degree Celsius reduction in global temperature by the year 2100,\" Trump said. \n\n>\"Tiny, tiny amount.\"\n\n\n>That claim was attributed to research conducted by MIT, according to White House documents seen by Reuters. The Cambridge, Massaschusetts-based research university published a study in April 2016 titled \"How much of a difference will the Paris Agreement make?\" showing that if countries abided by their pledges in the deal, global warming would slow by between 0.6 degree and 1.1 degrees Celsius by 2100.\n\n>\"We certainly do not support the withdrawal of the U.S. from the Paris agreement,\" said Erwan Monier, a lead researcher at the MIT Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change, and one of the study's authors.\n\n>\"If we don't do anything, we might shoot over 5 degrees or more and that would be catastrophic,\" said John Reilly, the co-director of the program, adding that MIT's scientists had had no contact with the White House and were not offered a chance to explain their work.",

America would literally be giving one of their largest global competitors money.\n\nFYI, Im a brit and I want the world to be a greener place so I would rather america stayed in, but, forgive me if im wrong but it seems like the deal is just america giving a bunch of other countries money and Trump said, from day one, that he would be a president for america, and not a president for america being the big daddy for everyone else. i.e. americas money is for america.\n\nClimate change is a real issue.

Yes the US would have to pay a certain amount of money to smaller countries but the reason for this is because every First world countrie has already made trillions by shitting on the planet from the late 1800's till today. \n\nWhen the negotiations started china and pretty much every other nation had an immovable argument which was \"you (First world countries) have used every possibility you had to aquire cheap dirty energy to get to the top and have your industries on top of the world and now you are asking the rest of us to slow down our progress with expensive energy because you realized that you fucked up the enviroment? Fuck you! Why would we play this game?\" The answer to this was money.... and rightfully so. \n\nThe problem in climate change is that after africa is fucked pretty much the whole rest of the world is too and the previous administration understands that very well. I am in china/Hong Kong atm and the climate is unbearable already but that is not the reason why china has become such a big supporter to this now. China is a powerhouse in renewables and has discovered the buisness part of it... all the money the US would have spent into this would have been earned back a tenfold over the years by selling your renewable energy products to the countries you gave your money to... \n\nThe agreement was a fucking miracle and a blessing at the same time.

That said, Trump's use of the tactic is both consistent and particularly egregious, as well as amplified by the rampant anti-intellectualism central to his message, campaign, and administration.  Whereas most politicians' use seems to me to be fairly limited, Trump's is just one aspect of his broader crusade against the very notion of objective reality.  \nIn short, *that* Trump's administration misrepresents studies isn't unique, but the *way* it does so, and the atmosphere to which the misrepresentation contributes, is.",

It's not some collection of foreign governments imposing their will on us, it's us imposing our will on us.  And if we felt like the targets that the previous administration had set would have too much economic cost, we absolutely could have modified our own targets to cause less of an impact without pulling out altogether.  Not only did Trump not understand the study that he cited to justify pulling out of the agreement, but he didn't understand the agreement that he was pulling out of, either.  Pulling out isn't saying \"we didn't like our self-imposed goals\", pulling out is saying \"we don't support this effort to reduce carbon emissions at all\".\n\nAnd the worst part is that he's justifying it by saying that he's trying to protect the jobs of coal miners.  The coal industry has roughly ~~93,000~~ [51,000](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CES1021210001) workers in the US, and that number has been shrinking for decades as power companies replace their coal-powered plants with natural gas or other sources of energy.  In 2014 the Solar industry employed 175,000 people, and during the year 2014 nearly 1.2% of all new jobs created in the US were in the solar power industry.  And that doesn't begin to touch on other forms of green energy like wind.  The coal industry is dead, it just hasn't stopped twitching yet.  Nothing Trump does will change that.\n\nThis is what you get when you let uninformed people elect an uninformed leader.\n\nEDIT:  Found an updated number that should be more accurate.",

People just dont get it, and unfortunately the by the time the next generational change in voters happen, itl be too late.

No joke, if Trump is cancer then Fox News is some horrifying mad scientist creating airborne cancer dispensers.\n\nEvery conservative I know (And I like in a conservative state with a conservative family) watches Fox News 24/7.  Every one, without fail.  It's on in offices, in public waiting rooms, everywhere.  And all day every day, it's the one thing on the TV in the background while everyone does anything, seeping into their brains like a subliminal poison.\n\nI'm listening today to their coverage of this Paris withdrawal and it's disgusting.  Cheeto POTUS does something and it's their job to spend every minute of every day afterwards making it okay, good for America, good for conservatives, and mocking those who disagree.\n\nThey're playing clips of coverage from basically every other network on the planet reacting to this news, and then they cut back to their little jerk off session on the couch where they are all laughing and mocking the libruls for being drama queens.  Saying things like, \"All this agreement was doing is shipping our incredibly valuable coal jobs to China\" and that \"President Trump went to the other leaders of the world and asked them to negotiate a deal that wasn't going to kill American jobs and they refused\" and framing it like the best news ever.  Coal Jobs are coming back, energy costs are going down, liberals have their panties in a bunch....it's a win, win, win!\n\nIt happens with everything that tiny-handed assclown and his party of backwards fuckwads does.  Our only hope here comes in mobilizing those on the left to vote and in the middle to vote left, because the people on the right are cheering in the streets right now about this.  I keep seeing them say, \"70% of Americans want us to stay in the agreement\" like that matters in any way.  But it only takes 19% of Americans to vote Trump into office as the most powerful man in the world as we just saw.\n\nAnd those 19% are a lost cause, they are a lock.  Trump said it right when he said he could fucking shoot a man in the middle of main street and they'd still vote for him.  HE COULD.  It's such an absurd statement that we kind of laugh at it, but he could literally walk out there and fucking kill a man and maybe we'd arrest and impeach him (BIG MAYBE) but if his name was still on the ballot, they would vote for him in a second.\n\nAs long as Fox News told them to.  Fuck Fox News.",

My response was \"do you think it's cool to continually cut funding for our schools?
