The thing is they have their own problems in their country that are a little more pressing, like roads and infrastructure, along with better spending for the citizens. The rural areas are somewhat reminiscent of Brazil in some areas with the very close together and stacked housing in some areas, and nobody really follows the rules of the road down there. I'm proud they're becoming one of the first carbon neutral for their emissions and I believe their economy will boom from it becoming 100\u2105. Here's hoping they don't put it all into tourism extravagance, because there's already plenty of shit to do and it's beautiful as fuck there. When they start upgrading the rural areas to be more modern I think that's their next move.\n\nEdit: as a recent end to lurking I'm surprised by the amount of upvotes. I guess it goes to show how much I just read the clever humans on here. And the shit posters.",

The United States probably used much more renewable energy last year then they did. Frankly any small nation should have little difficulty in achieving this, but as of right now it's not incredibly feasible for a country with nearly 100x the population.\n\nedit: I looked a little more into it, and roughly 14% of America's energy is renewable meaning that the U.S produced at least 10x the renewable energy that they did. Once again I am in no way trying to belittle their accomplishment, I'm simply pointing out that a lot of people will point at this and say there is no reason the U.S shouldn't be able to do the same, when they're simply not the same situation.

The environment ministry reports that **fuel burned by cars, buses and trains accounted for almost 70% of the country\u2019s carbon emissions in 2014**.\n\nAnd \n\n> The fact that even a country like Costa Rica, which has made major investments to produce clean energy, still struggles with these obstacles, shows just how difficult it would be for larger, more industrialised nations to follow in its footsteps.",

A quick review of the [Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydro-Qu%C3%A9bec#Power_generation) wiki provides 2013 numbers stating that 99.7% is clean/renewable energy. Since then, 4 of the plants that were generating that 0.3% (1 nuclear and 1 oil plant) have been decommissioned, leaving only 2 gas stations for peak use.\n\nAnother great thing about Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec, aside from some of the lowest rates in North America, is that they export a LOT of energy, meaning that the benefits of this are all spread to neighbouring regions (primarily Ontario and the US NorthEast).\n\nWith all that said... the number doesn't necessarily reflect some amazing masterplan of Qu\u00e9bec politicians to be 100% renewable - we did sort of \"win the lottery\" when living in a place that has 40% of all water resources of the country with MOST water resources in the world. Not everyone has the same advantages. \n\nedit: /u/Polar---Bear correctly points out below that nuclear power is also \"clean\", so in my first paragraph I should have stated \"99.7% is renewable energy\". My bad!",

    "body": "In Tasmania we have zero power plants that require fossil fuel. We're completely reliant on Hydro, Wind and Solar (mostly hydro). The exception however is during the dry season, when the water reserves in the dams shrink, and may have to import coal or gas temporarily. Tasmania, I'm assuming Quebec too, is benefited by its small population and abundance of land to use for energy. Take a look at the most populous states in Australia and you'll get a different result, sadly. Syndey and Melbourne have a population 8 times that of the entirety of Tasmania, so I can't imagine all the dams in the surrounding area could provide enough power to keep the cities functional. Plus, changing from coal to solar or wind would be ridiculously expensive. I can't see the rest of the states and territories joining the \"100% clean\" club anytime soon. ",

The methane emitted from these is generally part of the natural microbial loop cycle, it's not taking carbon that was locked up in sedimentary rock and putting it in the atmosphere the way fossil fuels do. \n\nDams are generally pretty harmful to the surrounding ecosystems, but I wouldn't say they cause climate change, just that they aren't a great solution to it. \n\nEdit: It's also worth mentioning that methane generated from this process has a life of ~10-12 years in the atmosphere, while both CO2 and N2O can persist for more than 100 years. A proper accounting of the impact of GHG will include this to determine which is worse, but I'd rather switch from CO2 generation to methane generation on a path to GHG neutral than have to wait and make do with CO2 pollution, as that has consequences further into the future than methane does.

It makes complete sense. \n\nI remember when I visited the [1924 build Walchensee Hydroelectric Power Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walchensee_Hydroelectric_Power_Station) as a teenager about 30 years ago they told us about the massive problem of organic material turning the  Walchensee Lake toxic. They solved the problem by pumping air deep down to the bottom of the lake. This caused a steady slow current and the air stopped the toxic anaerobe decomposing and fish could live in the lake. \n\nYour article was an eye opener to me because even if you do that, there will still aerob decomposing, creating methane (like in the guts of a cow). Just one question: Wouldn't the organic material in the rivers would have finally reached the oceans and decompose there? Is is relevant when and where it is decomposing?",

I am *guessing* that it all comes down to the definition of \"water resources\". I have seen your figure in wikipedia's definition of our water *coverage* (i.e. amount of surface area that is covered by water), but I have also seen several places that quote our resources as 366k km2 (twice as much as your number).\n\nI believe the biggest factor in that difference is the inclusion/exclusion of the St-Lawrence Basin area out into the ocean (which may not be included in \"territorial water coverage\" even though it is part of Qu\u00e9bec's jurisdiction), as well as underground aquifers.",

There is no doubt that nuclear represents a massive advantage over these, and there are jurisdictions that still produce the vast majority of their power this way (Indiana is one I know of, for example: 88.5% power generation via coal).\n\nAt the same time, I also DO NOT support nuclear energy in the long-term, or whenever a better economic argument can be made for renewables. In Qu\u00e9bec, it made total sense to shut down the Gentilly nuclear power station: several studies pointed at generating costs of 9 to 12 \u00a2/kWh, meaning they would have had to operate at a loss on the internal market (our rates are mostly 5 to 9 \u00a2/kWh) and perhaps a slight margin on the export markets.\n\nI realize those are my personal opinions, but my point is: it doesn't always come down to a black or white situation (actually, it hardly ever does in life, but I digress)",

The economy is too fossil-fuel dependent for vehicles still to prosper just yet.  \n\nI've lived over 1,000 days of my life there.  If I could afford to live there, I'd go to Zarcero tomorrow, buy land up by Pueblo Nuevo, build a home, and run a language school having gringos fly down and spend a semester there, while having Costa Ricans learn English (real English).  \n\nWith that said, ticos are awful drivers, and the country is held back because of it.  But, they are awful drivers because the fucking tr\u00e1nsitos don't do their jobs and because la policia can't pull people over, only a tr\u00e1nsito can, and they are usually just sitting somewhere, or doing a stupid cone stop.  The laws on the books aren't enforced.  If they were, the deaths would stop, the danger would stop y uno podr\u00eda andar si arriesgarse la vida cada puta vez que viaja por el pa\u00eds.  Pero, hasta aquel entonces, tendremos que aguantar choferes de bus que rayan subiendo una cuesta ciega durante un aguacero en la madrugada.  \n\nGive me 200 new tr\u00e1nsitos, 2 years, and the political will of the higher ups to reform the police system (and allow ALL cops to pull people over), and the roads would be much safer after I was done.  \n\nAlso, \n\n1. if you offer a bribe, you sobornos = 30 days in jail.\n\n2. Furgones = have to pull over and let people pass when there is a shoulder (los hijueputas corren en vez de permitir que los carres les pasen).\n\n3. Mandatory vehicle inspections for the marchamo.  Pay the inspectors enough so that bribes are not enticing. \n\n4. If you hit a pedestrian while passing someone, you forfeit your car. \n\n5.  COPS CAN ONLY USE THEIR FLASHING LIGHTS WHEN THERE IS A FUCKING EMERGENCY AND NOT JUST, YA KNOW, ALL DAY EVERY DAY.  \n\nI could go on and on, but I'll stop.

Prices for electricity are very high and in some cases we have to get rid of excess energy which also is kinda costly. It cost about 20.000.000\u20ac to get rid of all the excess electric energy that was being created just during the christmas holidays due to all wind turbines going full blast in windy weather and most industry not using electricity because of the holidays (The same energy-heavy industry that gets a hefty discount on electric energy during the year because of they're \"heavy users\" and might move production to countries with more sensible leaders). Current law is that producers of green energy can sell their electricity at fixed prices to the national power grid no matter if its needed at the moment or not. One moment there may be a short due to the fact that we're planning to turn off all nuclear power stations and the next moment there's way to much energy (low consumption, very sunny or windy) threatening the stability of the power grid so we have to actually pay neighboring countries like France or Austria to use our excess energy.  \n  If you then take into relation that emissions from German powerplants were minuscule on a global level to begin with it's ridiculous that we endure these problems, and it's not likely they'll disappear in the next future. Just like other genius German ideas as a special tax on plastic shopping bags that you got for free in the past, now they cost you a few cents to \"reduce littering and plastic waste in the ocean\". It's not like a single German plastic bag would reach the ocean, we Germans like to properly recycle our trash anyways. Look at pictures of an random Indonesian slum or some other Asian/African country where there are a lot of people living in filth and you'll know where that plastic trash is coming from.  \n  /rant",
