So I set my Google (search parameters) to early 2015. Found this absolutely mind blowing article from New York Times where the reporter, Adrian Chen, physically visited their troll farm and talked to people who worked there. How I never heard about this is frightening. \n\nInteresting point the article seems to gloss over because it may not have seemed that relevant back then: Back in 2015 the troll farm had a budget of $400,000 a MONTH. This was BEFORE they ramped things up to a dozen notches in mid 2016. Here's the article.\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/07/magazine/the-agency.html\n\n\n[UPDATE] Thanks for the Gold :)!! I would encourage someone follow the money to find out who is funding this farm, but at the same time, most people don't like poison flavored tacos.",

    "body": "Despite this account being new for reasons, I have been on Reddit since the beginning of the Ukrainian revolution in 2013, discussing the subject and calling for attention for the ways Russia has been conducting undercover operations actively all over the western world to influence, undermine, corrupt and destabilise it since 2003.\n\nWhat makes me angry is that only now a significant amount of people start realizing what is going on, and despite powerful countries countries having NSA CIAs, FBIs, SIS, Mi5s, and all that kind of shit, it took 14 years for them to start looking at it the way it should and people to start realising what is going on. 14 damn years to understand that it was not just \"business as usual\" and start doing something about it. \n\nI never been anti-establishment, believe and respect democracy and believe that there's good and bad people everywhere including in control of our systems. But at this point what I feel like saying is that these guys who we have looking after our defences, watching for us, and tasked to do what it takes to preserve our balance, interests, values and foundations, ARE ALL A BUNCH OF FUCKING INCOMPETENT MOUTH BREATHERS.\n\nI'm just a regular guy, I believe intelligent, with a regular job, born and raised in a small Western European country, who likes to know what is going on around the world, look deep into things and understand them, have travelled a lot and worked in different countries. Without anything in special I could understand many things that were going on in a much broader way, and predict way to many things that were proven true years latter including the Russia influencing US elections and boasting extremism, all this without access to any kind of special information, just by looking at the whole picture, history, culture, psychology and human nature, information available to the public from all sides and how it was shaped, etc.  \n\nFor instance, when everybody was believing that Putin was the great guy that Russia needed, who got rid of oligarchs and was bringing Russia closer to the West, I always said that it was just his game to raise his power and create relations that he could undermine latter. \nWhen he managed to establish government control of Gazprom in 2005, I called it his final move into institutionalise corruption so he could play with all range of means for his goals. \nWhen RT was launched in 2005 and started broadcasting in foreign languages in western countries, I called it the metastasis of the Kremlin cancer. \n\nMy interest in these subjects spiked when I found that there were Russians with agendas infiltrating New Age groups at raves, music festivals and on-line communities to spread anti-establishment sentiments in the youth of Western countries, when I was administrator of a on-line forum in 2003. But I never joined any activist group or anything. I've just been curiously watching and sometimes commenting and discussing on-line.\n\nI saw that there's a silent war going on, with attacks by one side while the other one sleeps comfortable.  \n\nThe more I got interested in the subjects as I saw them shaping the reality of this world, the more I could find and understand what was going on and the more I could see what is coming and that there's nothing I can do about it as my the only option I have is my worthless vote in democracy in a small country that holds no power or influence in the world stage. \n\nI was victim of hacking and even personal attacks just for expressing my opinion many times and that was the biggest prof that I was not just a delusional conspiratard. However, where are those who I vote for or pay taxes for their salaries to watch over these kind of things? What are they doing? \n\nSo, I'm getting angry to the point of thinking that after all we as society deserve this shit, and I feel like saying fuck society, fuck social values, fuck people, and start caring only about myself no matter at what and who's cost. The only reasons why it is not my nature to care only for myself, this exactly what those people want, people like me to become cynical like them, defeating modern societies, dumping everything we have learned so far, giving a victory for those who are doing everything to set this world backwards so they can rule in their old fashion way.\n\nNow let me leave this clear. I don't believe that this is what the majority of Russians want for themselves and for the world. But a minority boosted by the ones in power there, way to much power, that control a country with vast natural resources that they can use and abuse at will. Their end game is the raise of something akin of neo-feudalism with which they believe they will be able to rule the world as they are the ones taking lead, and they see chances of succeeding as they are spreading cynicism, and associating themselves with others abroad with similar views, who hold power and wealth enough to make the counter efforts innefective. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n",

Talk about the military crackdowns. \n\nWhen they start freaking out about how none of that is true reveal that you were talking about Turkey. Watch them breakdown arguing about whether or not Turkey is European. \n\nJust keep apologizing and say you assumed all  Europeans are the same. Also bring up Brexit when things start going to shit because that turns the Brits against the Germans. \n\nNow just keep applying pressure as they start tearing into each other. Finally call in your alt to talk about the migrant crisis. Have no opinion on it. Just bring it up. Boom and there we go. Now the Germans are arguing among themselves while the Italians and the Greeks are going at the Germans.\n\nNow go ahead and take that flaming garbage pile and cross post that to subreddit drama. Make the title about literal German Nazis. Now take that a put it in Drama for the cherry on top.",

It\u2019s been kind of a laugh; I even did some counter-crapping of my own. But tonight the cranks have totally pounced.\u201d Shepry paused, seemed to run out of jargon.

They actually do have opposition voices, but they're pretty good at making them out to be crazy. And actually, part of the genius of their political theatre, is it's very often the same person behind both the for and opposed POV.\n\n>They have an upper hand because everyone else is trying to play fair. They also claim everyone else isn't playing fair. \n\nActually, from their perspective they are actually correct here. I'm not saying that they ARE correct, but when they dissolved the Soviet Union, and became by far the most powerful successor state, effectively in command of the CIS, they did so with certain points of view about their security and position within the world. They spent 10 years being economically gutted by deep internal problems, and external exploitation as if they were blackout drunk, and then woke up from that, with a very bad hangover and NATO right on their border.\n\nSure, countries like Poland, and Lithuania are acting in their own, likely sensible interests to sign up to get a security guarantee, but you can see what I'm trying to say here. The Russians genuinely believe that this is encroachment. Hell, even prominent Americans like Kissinger have said that this is precisely how they will treat it.\n\nAnd this grievance is causing them to act in much the way they think the West acts. Which is informed, to a large degree, by the world view and history lessons taught by the Soviet Union; that the USA is not democratic. That it interferes and meddles in other countries, and uses it's economic might and technology to maintain is violent hegemony.",

Or at least on the topic of the sorts of people who are being thus manipulated. \n\n>The US is experiencing a deep epistemic breach, a split not just in what we value or want, but in who we trust, how we come to know things, and what we believe we know \u2014 what we believe exists, is true, has happened and is happening.\n  \n>The primary source of this breach, to make a long story short, is the US conservative movement\u2019s rejection of the mainstream institutions devoted to gathering and disseminating knowledge (journalism, science, the academy) \u2014 the ones society has appointed as referees in matters of factual dispute.   \n    \n>In their place, the right has created its own parallel set of institutions, most notably its own media ecosystem.\n  \n>But the right\u2019s institutions are not of the same kind as the ones they seek to displace. Mainstream scientists and journalists see themselves as beholden to values and standards that transcend party or faction. They try to separate truth from tribal interests and have developed various guild rules and procedures to help do that. They see themselves as neutral arbiters, even if they do not always uphold that ideal in practice.\n  \n>The pretense for the conservative revolution was that mainstream institutions had failed in their role as neutral arbiters \u2014 that they had been taken over by the left, become agents of the left in referee\u2019s clothing, as it were.\n  \n>But the right did not want better neutral arbiters. The institutions it built scarcely made any pretense of transcending faction; they are of and for the right. There is nominal separation of conservative media from conservative politicians, think tanks, and lobbyists, but in practice, they are all part of the conservative movement. They are prosecuting its interests; that is the ur-goal.\n  \n>Indeed, the far right rejects the very idea of neutral, binding arbiters; there is only Us and Them, only a zero-sum contest for resources. That mindset leads to what I call \u201ctribal epistemology\u201d \u2014 the systematic conflation of what is true with what is good for the tribe. \n  \nThese Russian troll-farms are just capitalizing upon the weaponized ignorance and hyper-partisanship that already exists in American culture. This is something that's been manufactured by right-wing leaders - political, social, media and religious - for decades now, and the Russians have just slid into that community online and taken advantage of the system for their own benefit.

Yes it was a fun episode based on the narrative on-screen but those of us who sometimes miss the (happy) trees for the (sad) forest saw that those people no longer necessarily had any self-determination and could be enslaved or controlled or switched off at the slightest whim of anyone in the physical world.  \n\nWhy weren't they connected to the internet?  Was that sadomasochism bar that \"everyone ends up at\" an indication that their existence was flawed in some way, leaving them seeking pain to feel anything at all?  Who was paying the power bills, and why?  If they wanted out, was there anywhere else to go?  Could they even know if they *had* left, given how real it all seemed?  Since they no longer had the ability to work a job or generate wealth of any kind (so far as we know), would anyone in the real world even consider them for a single moment?  \n\nThey became non-persons with no way to fend for themselves, no power, almost certainly no rights, and as presented, the only way out was death.  I mean I guess sure, it's possibly better than being *actually dead*--for the time it was shown on-screen.  But unless that was a post-scarcity society where AIs/ex-humans are respected and given full protections, AND they weren't being exploited, AND their existence itself wasn't fundamentally flawed in the way Black Mirror likes to deviate towards, those poor people are just waiting for things to go south.",

Telepathy, unfortunately, turns out to not be all about elevated Apollonian abstract intellectualism: it's an emotion amplifier and taps into the most toxic wellsprings of the subconscious. As implemented, it brings out the worst in us. Twitter and Facebook et al are fine-tuned to turn us all into car-crash rubberneckers and public execution spectators. It can be used for good, but more often it drags us down into the dim-witted, outraged weltanschauung of the mob.",
