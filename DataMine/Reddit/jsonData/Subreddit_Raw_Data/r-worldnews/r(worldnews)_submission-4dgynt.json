    "body": "Immediate reaction on Icelandic social media: Good that he finally resigned, but *not enough*. Outrage that ~~the coalition~~ the Progressive party intends to move on like nothing happened.\n\nEDIT: Events are far from over. We still haven't seen the full response from the Independence party (the other coalition member), the opposition, or the president.\n\nEDIT2: The head of the Independence party apparently agrees with this plan. I don't. Thousands of others don't. There is another protest in 25 minutes. I'm out.\n\nEDIT3: (4 hours later) The protest is over, it is now clear the ruling coalition does not intend to break. Further, in a [press release](http://kjarninn.is/frettir/2016-04-05-upplysingafulltrui-rikisstjornar-sigmundur-lagdi-til-ad-sigurdur-ingi-taeki-vid-um-oakvedinn-tima/) (English after a paragraph of Icelandic), the coalition now presents it as **the prime minister not having resigned at all**, merely appointing the vice-chairman as acting PM for an unspecified amount of time. So it doesn't look like this is anywhere close to being over.\n\nEDIT4: (Wednesday morning). Situation remains unclear. Debates behind closed doors everywhere. [The state TV](http://www.ruv.is/frett/what-exactly-is-going-on-in-iceland) has produced a rapid recap and summary in English.",

    "body": "Just for a heads up the situation is still extremely volatile and nothing is resolved for the moment. The day's events have been moving extremely fast and been quite confusing. This morning the former PM Sigmundur Gunnlaugson said in a radio interview that the government was standing firm. Then around noon he went to meet with the President of the republic (the non-political head of state) to demand that the president dismiss parliament and call elections. The president refused this request, and the move was received as a very bizarre and botched powerplay by Gunnlaugsson. Now, around 3 pm, the former prime minister has decided to step down and nominate the vice chairman of his Progressive Party to assume the title of Prime Minister and continue the government coalition.\n\nA few things are clear at the moment. Firstly that this decision was made by the leaders of the Progressive Party alone, which is only one of two parties in the coalition government. The other ruling party, the Independence Party, might have completely different ideas about what should follow and who, if anyone, should assume the prime minister-ship. The opposition in parliament is furthermore adamant that this will not be enough and state that the only sensible thing to do at this point is to call snap elections.\n\nI'll try to update you on events as they unfold.\n\nEdit: Typos.\n\n**Update**: The minister of finance, Bjarni Benediktsson, and chairman of the other ruling Independence party has just returned from his meeting with the president. He says he will sit down and discuss what the following events will be with the proposed new prime minister of the Progressive Party Sigur\u00f0ur Ingi J\u00f3hannsson. He says he will not demand the prime ministership for himself but he is sounding like he would like the current government to continue and finish their term. This is not surprising, but I doubt it'll change the call for snap elections by the opposition and the populace.\n\n**Update 2**: I gotta go to work, but the world's eyes and huge media outlets seem to be following this keenly so you should have no problem keeping informed. As an outraged citizen I'll just say this, considering the scope of this incompetence, corruption and outrage this response is simply **not enough**. I and thousands of others will not stop until we have a new government with a new mandate as soon as possible.",

No discussion entertained either. \n\n- Russia : Putin's got things in a headlock, will toss one or two people under the bus to show he took action. Also create some security distraction again elsewhere to take the focus away and show he is the best guardian of the nation.\n\n- China : discussion is blocked. What you don't know can't hurt you.\n\n\n- Britain : Cameron's going to play the dead father card and say he knew nothing. Also suddenly seems to remember something about personal privacy.\n\n- south America : aside from regulatory amendments, nothing will really change, as the system is what it is.

Pretty much everyone in DC during his tenure as mayor had a story about him, my Dad used to see him sneaking into the apartment building my parents lived in because he was shacking up with one of their neighbors at the time. Everyone forgave him because he served the people well\n\nEDIT2: Also before I get any responses about other problems with Mayor Barry, yes he was corrupt and a tax cheat, but that doesn't take away from what he did for the city.

    "body": "The problem is that in Countries like the United States, our two party system has been deeply ingrained in our culture, and has become apart of our identity. People actually identify themselves with their political party, even on the same level as religion.\n\nMeaning, most people are raised their entire lives to believe in one party, and it makes it very hard for people to shake their loyalty or beliefs. Political indoctrination etc. The other issue is, the system was designed in a specific way, where it always pits two things against each other. You are either THIS, or THAT. And as a result, people always believe the other side is always worse than their side (which then stunts critical thinking, and criticisms of their own party).\n\nThe system is really kind of perfectly evil, as it guarantees the same people stay in power, and does so on the basis of dividing people across lines. It's played a huge role in making this country bitter and angry and hateful of the other half of their fellow Americans. \n\nThe only hope I have, is that for the first time in a long time, we are seeing most Americans sick of both parties. There is growing movement of distrust of the government in general, and the idea that both parties are awful. So my hope is that we eventually get a third party running, or we start to see some major shifts happen as a result of most people being fed up with both sides failing them.\n\nOne of the reasons I was so hopeful for Obama in 2008, is because I saw a huge effort by the American people to reject the Bush admin, and the direction he was taking our country in. Finally people were really angry, and were saying No. **My biggest disappointment with Obama, is how quickly those on the left rolled over, and started justifying Obama expanding on the very same things they were outraged with the Bush admin**. It was a sign to me that, this country was still deeply rooted in party politics, and it was never really about rejecting things they thought was wrong (because those things are suddenly okay, as long as it's their party or guy doing it). \n\nBut with all the anger and distrust, I want to think that we will eventually move away from this. It really hurts when I see so many on the left embracing everything the Obama admin has done, and saying they want it all the continue with Clinton (not saying you can't like Obama, or believe he was still better then the other guy. But his admin still did some truly horrendous things, and not only failed to take the country in a new direction away from where Bush was going, he actually expanded and embraced on some of these things). So it's just disappointing that so many people are now OKAY with some of the shit the Bush/Obama admin were doing, and actually want it to stay the course (and this is coming from those on the Left, that you would think would be against this). \n\n",

    "body": "I'll note that our two-party system does have its advantages. First, dissenting from the party line, while relatively uncommon in recent years, is at least acceptable here. In many parliamentary systems, where the very existence of the ruling government depends on toeing the party line, dissent is not tolerated to the same degree whatsoever. \n\n\n\nSecond, and most importantly, the two party system gives those on the outside at least a chance at becoming president. Look at the success of Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump this time around, and Ron Paul's own rise to popularity in the last cycle. In a multi-party system, Bernie would lead the Democratic Socialist Party perhaps, but would never become President or Prime Minister. Ron Paul might lead the Libertarian Party, but never move further. Donald Trump's rise might be limited to some sort of ultra-conservative party or something like that.\n\n\n\nMy point is that even in multi-party systems, there is rarely a situation in which several similar-sized parties vie for power. It is often, like in Britain, a political scene dominated by two major inclusive parties, with one or two minor parties also present with the ability to influence the forming of governments and the like.\n\n\n\nThe American system allows people like Sanders or Trump to, at the will of the people, rise to prominence and change the direction of the country or--at the very least--the party in which they rise.\n\n\n\nNote also that in the US, you actually get to vote for the *candidates* who run in the general presidential election. This starkly contrasts with most parliamentary systems, in which you don't get to directly vote for the Prime Minister *or* those vying for that position. \n\n\n\nJust some food for thought.",

    "body": "The Green Party in Canada is in much the same boat although they are arguably more mainstream now as a complete party. Oddly enough, in the 2011 election (or possibly the one before that) many environmental groups were saying that the New Democratic Party had the better platform regarding environmental issues. This is all just opinion of course.\n\nThe NDP have historically been a complete, socialist/left type of party and ended up coming second in that 2011 election. It's not odd for them to have good environmental policies/platforms... but allegedly better than the Green Party?\n\nThis kind of gives some context as to how hard the Greens were pushing to become a more mainstream party. They seemed to tone down their environmentalist roots to maybe seem less radical, I dunno.\n\nThey've gotten somewhere between 3-4.5% of the total vote in the past few elections, which is pretty significant.",

Third parties right now get too little of the vote to win a seat anywhere no matter how you draw the lines.\n\nThe best way to get third parties in office would be to shift all or some of the House of Representatives to proportional representation. In the 2014 midterms, the most successful third party was the Libertarian Party with 1.2% of the vote, yet they won no seats in the 435-member body. If the House was based on proportional representation, they would have won 5 seats.\n\nNow, five seats would introduce some different voices into the room, which could well be positive, but it's hardly enough to change the face of Congress. However, if people didn't feel that voting outside the Democrat and Republican parties was pissing their vote away, they would be more inclined to do so and you'd see more people voting Libertarian or Green or perhaps smaller single-issue parties.\n\nThe other cool byproduct of proportional representation is it also reduces or eliminates gerrymandering as an issue, depending whether you eliminate districts entirely or go to a mixed system. Personally, I like the idea of having someone representing MY community in Congress and having one person who's MY representative, so I'm a big fan of how the German Bundestag is elected.",
