Because that's what makes America great to begin with. I couldn't, however, let this legislation become law without first attaching my income tax reports for the past 30 years to it as well.

It was meant to be reserved for the prime members of the Aryan race, and it was strictly for German nationals who could prove their Aryan ancestry. After the invasion of the low countries and France, peoples considered related to the Germanic Aryan race were permitted entry, so, for example, the SS Division Nordland consisted of Danes, Dutch, Norwegians, Swedes and Finns (who volunteered) and were led by German officers. But I'll tell you right now that 60% of the SS were not foreign (and you'll see why by the end).\n\nAfter initial invasion of the Soviet Union, I think it was in the year 1942, the number of foreign divisions were increased. It eventually became the case the people considered 'Untermensch' or 'subhuman' by Nazi racial theory were allowed serve in this once exclusive organisation. Why? They were running low on men. The Germans really did not have the capacity to fight a two-front war, let alone against the Soviets who simply had more men (and women and children) to throw into the war effort and thus were at a strong advantage. \n\nNow this is where my memory is a bit wonky. I don't think there were any non-German SS men at all, and you might find it funny when I tell you why. I'm almost certain that all foreign fighters in the Waffen-SS (the military part of the SS), all of these were considered to be foreign recruits commanded by German officers. So, on a technicality, the racial purity of the SS could be maintained (even though by the end of the war the SS had taken control of all foreign divisions and legions, even ones previously serving under the Wehrmacht).\n\nSo it's the case that we know there were foreign divisions fight in the Waffen-SS, like the Nordland division or the Cossack division. But it was the officers commanding them who were members of the SS, not the men who were just considered 'foreign recruits'. Take from that what you will. But it did start out as an exclusively German organisation. So the OP was right, it was more the case \"Oh you are one of the people we hate but you'll fight for us? OK you're in!\" then it wasn't. \n\nAnd just to mention, I'm just an amateur historian, and it's been a while since I studied the subject. If I made any mistakes, or if anyone would like to ask me a question, then please message away!",

I haven't seen anyone try to defend nazis on that sub since.\n\nDamn, wish I'd seen that at the time. I've been working with a few people in /r/furry to show the positive side of the fandom in my sitcom (as opposed to the regular portrayal in TV shows). Sure, there's a few jokes thrown about yiffing and rainfurrest but they're actually jokes firing back at the racist closet furry (How else would he know what e621 is, or what happened at rainfurrest unless he was taking part in the community that he's attacking?).\n\nNow I'm wondering if the final scene of the episode should be revealing him as a member of the 'Furred Reich' just to show how much of a loser he is - Attacks people for wearing fursuits publicly, puts one on in his bedroom because he doesn't want his face attached to the Nazi movement.",

But other players \"considered it a form of cheating,\" Green writes, and many posted \"anti-Chinese vitriol\" on bulletin boards. \n>\n>Eventually, Blizzard shut down accounts used by virtual \"gold farmers\" and IGE became the target of a class-action suit by a player who said the company's practices were \"substantially impairing\" players' enjoyment of the game. \n>\n>Bannon took control of the company from Brock Pierce, a child actor who appeared in The Mighty Ducks films and, according to Internet Movie Database, was a consultant on an episode of HBO series Silicon Valley. \n>\n>Even though the business plan was a flop, Bannon became intrigued by the game's online community dynamics. In describing gamers, Bannon said, **\"These guys, these rootless white males, had monster power. ... It was the pre-reddit. It's the same guys on (one of a trio of online message boards owned by IGE) Thottbot who were [later] on reddit\" and other online message boards where the alt-right flourished, Bannon said.**\n>\n>Green postulates that Bannon's time at IGE was \"one that introduced him to a hidden world, burrowed deep into his psyche, and provided a kind of conceptual framework that he would later draw on to build up the audience for Breitbart News, and then to help marshal the online armies of trolls and activists that overran national politicians and helped give rise to Donald Trump,\" Green writes.\n>\n>After taking over in 2012 at the Breitbart News Network \u2014 it was founded five years earlier by Andrew Breitbart, who died in 2012 \u2014 Bannon recruited Milo Yiannopoulos to handle technology coverage.\n>\n>Like Andrew Breitbart, Yiannopoulos \"just had that 'it' factor,\" Bannon says in the book. \"The difference was, Andrew had a very strong moral universe, and Milo is an amoral nihilist.\"\n>\n>Yiannopoulos devoted much of Bretibart's tech coverage to cultural issues, particularly Gamergate, a long-running online argument over gaming culture that peaked in 2014. And that helped fuel an online alt-right movement sparked by Breitbart News. \n>\n>**\"I realized Milo could connect with these kids right away,\" Bannon told Green. \"You can activate that army. They come in through Gamergate or whatever and then get turned onto politics and Trump.\"**\n\ntl;dr Steve Bannon realized after dealing with gold farming politics in World of Warcraft that he could turn a certain demographic of gamers onto far-right politics, and realized that Milo was the amoral nihilist for the job.",

    "body": "As a non-pro domme I can tell you that this is strangely accurate. \n\nOne theory is that men (and women!) with a controlling or dominant personality in their everyday life often find themselves unable to get release because it requires some amount of \"surrender\" to sensation, leaving them to fetishise that aspect of sex. IE they're so \"full\" of being in control that they have a fetish of loosing it. Like if your diet is all sweet stuff you end up craving savory. \n\n ...But then there's the question of whether the controlling personality invents the fetish or if the fetish creates the controlling personality as a type of compensation for the shame surrounding sex and the need to surrender. Kind of like how bullies are often compensating for an unhappy lack of control in their homelife.\n\n All I know is that every culture has some form of \"release\" festival that allows behavior that is taboo otherwise (see: sexy costumes on halloween), and that suggests to me that it's a bit of both. (Which would explain why dommes are in short supply compared to doms- it's both that men are more often in positions of power and that men are taught/expected to never surrender to their emotions.)
