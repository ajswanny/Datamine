    "body": "How to avoid palm oil\n\nUnfortunately, palm oil is found in a variety of products, ranging from candy bars to toothpaste to makeup, and rarely is it clearly labeled. In fact, there are more than 170 different names that manufacturers use on their packaging to avoid saying the words \u201cpalm oil.\" That may make purging palm oil products from your cabinets and shopping list sound overwhelming, but I\u2019ve rounded up some easy tips for doing so \u2014 ones that don\u2019t include memorizing all 170 names.\n\nHere are six reliable ways to avoid palm oil:\n1.The most common name palm oil is disguised under is \u201cvegetable oil.\u201d\n2.Most prepackaged snack foods made by corporate giants (Nestle, Unilever, etc.) contain palm oil.\n3.If a product's saturated fat content makes up more than 40 percent of its total fat content, it will almost always contain palm oil.\n4.Ingredients with the word \"palm\" in them are palm oil or are derived from the oil palm fruit.\n5.If you\u2019re not sure whether a product contains palm oil, either type the product name into your search engine along with \"palm oil\" and scan the search results, or contact the company and ask if they use palm oil.\n6.To avoid palm oil, choose products that contain clearly labeled oils, such as 100 percent sunflower oil, corn oil, olive oil, coconut oil, or canola oil.\n\nFor a more in depth description of ways to avoid contributing to palm oil harvesting see source below. \n\nhttps://www.gaiam.com/blogs/discover/6-ways-to-avoid-palm-oil-and-why-you-should",

I can assure you that the land we use is not habitable in the first place (at least not for the big mammals such as Orangutans) since it is a flooded peat area.  \n&nbsp;  \n\nThere are reasons why people in the third world country still need to use palm oil as their main consumption. I agree that some palm plantation are not environmentally friendly and the deforestation and destruction of natural habitat are not sustainable. Our government has been trying to move toward a more sustainable palm industry and it takes time.  \n&nbsp;\n\nIMO there is always an economic reason to why companies prefer using so-called unsustainable palm oil, it's cheap, at least cheaper than the other alternatives such as sunflower or soybean oil. Now you can say that companies who do this are selfish and only want to increase their profit margin. Well yeah, sadly that's the reality of capitalism. Whatever it takes to increase the profit margin.  \n&nbsp;\n\nPalm oil has a lot of use. It is used for snacks, cooking oil, soap, margarine, biofuel etc. This is the reason why it is such a lucrative industry. And the low cost of producing palm oil means that these products can be provided at a low price while companies can still make a profit. I'm not trying to defend the big companies by saying this. Some of you said you are willing to pay a higher price to use alternative oil, but in the third world country $1 more is a matter of being able to feed the family for another couple of day or not.   \n&nbsp;\n\nAll the above points don't mean we should ignore the effect of unsustainable palm products. We should move toward a more sustainable palm industry while keeping the price low. We, people living in developing countries, are simply not able to entirely stop consuming palm products. Palm industry takes up a big chunk of the GDP and provides millions of people employment (including me).  I can understand why not buying **unsustainable** palm products is a good idea, but we should pressure big companies to use more sustainable palm products not entirely boycott and vilify the products.",

    "body": "It's important to remember that, while *unsustainable* palm oil is a terrible scourge on Indonesia's forests, many biologists and environmental groups, including Greenpeace and [Erik Meijaard](https://ensia.com/voices/palm-oil-not-the-evil-we-think-it-is/) of the IUCN Palm Oil Task Force, warn that [blanket boycotts of all palm oil aren't the answer,](https://www.ethz.ch/en/news-and-events/eth-news/news/2017/10/banning-oil-palm-blocks-good-practices.html) and could actually do more harm than good by dis-incentivizing the adoption of better growing practices. \n\nThe first thing to understand is that, *when grown wisely,* palm oil is actually an incredibly sustainable crop. Oil palms produce far more oil with less water and land than other vegetable oils. As of 2014, oil palms produced 30 percent of global vegetable oils while using just 4 percent of the total land area planted for all oil-producing crops. This is a good thing, but not when the land used to grow oil palms is obtained by destroying forests and peatlands. However, *it doesn't have to be this way,* and not all palm oil plantations are bad for the environment. For example, many palm oil plantations in Colombia produce deforestation-free palm oil by growing the palms on former cattle ranches and other already-degraded lands.\n\nA better option is more nuanced: reward sustainable plantations by purchasing palm oil that's grown without deforestation, and punish the unsustainable producers by boycotting *only the palm oil that's grown irresponsibly.* This can be done by encouraging companies to improve the traceability of the palm oil in their supply chains so that they buy from the good plantations and avoid the bad ones. It's not a pipe dream: many companies are making genuine strides towards ensuring that they purchase only sustainably-produced palm oil,  including the maker of Nutella, which is [endorsed by Greenpeace](https://qz.com/430450/no-you-dont-have-to-boycott-nutella-for-the-environment-says-greenpeace/) for using only palm oil that has been certified by the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil. \n\nLike many environmental issues, palm oil isn't a zero-sum, black and white problem. Do your research (search \"palm oil scorecard\" on Google to check brands) and purchase products from companies that are engaging in palm oil best practices, while avoiding the ones that lag behind. And don't forget to write to the laggards and demand better sourcing! It's not as simple as a knee-jerk blanket boycott, but it's much a more effective solution to the problem.",

I personally believe that it would be great to see companies start making more decisions based on ideals and ethics, but let's be honest, profit is their driving force.

If this is something that bothers you as a consumer, your best bet is to stop giving them your money. If everyone that disagrees with their practices stopped purchasing their products they might have some actual incentive to change. ",

    "body": "While this is good advice for avoiding *unsustainable* palm oil, many biologists and environmental groups, including Greenpeace and [Erik Meijaard](https://ensia.com/voices/palm-oil-not-the-evil-we-think-it-is/) of the IUCN Palm Oil Task Force, warn that [blanket boycotts of all palm oil aren't the answer,](https://www.ethz.ch/en/news-and-events/eth-news/news/2017/10/banning-oil-palm-blocks-good-practices.html) and could actually do more harm than good by dis-incentivizing the adoption of better growing practices. \n\nThe first thing to understand is that, *when grown wisely,* palm oil is actually an incredibly sustainable crop. Oil palms produce far more oil with less water and land than other vegetable oils. As of 2014, oil palms produced 30 percent of global vegetable oils while using just 4 percent of the total land area planted for all oil-producing crops. This is a good thing, but not when the land used to grow oil palms is obtained by destroying forests and peatlands. However, *it doesn't have to be this way,* and not all palm oil plantations are bad for the environment. As the article notes, many palm oil plantations in Colombia produce deforestation-free palm oil by growing the palms on former cattle ranches and other already-degraded lands.\n\nA better option is more nuanced: reward sustainable plantations by purchasing palm oil that's grown without deforestation, and punish the unsustainable producers by boycotting *only the palm oil that's grown irresponsibly.* This can be done by encouraging companies to improve the traceability of the palm oil in their supply chains so that they buy from the good plantations and avoid the bad ones. It's not a pipe dream: many companies are making genuine strides towards ensuring that they purchase only sustainably-produced palm oil,  including the maker of Nutella, which is [endorsed by Greenpeace](https://qz.com/430450/no-you-dont-have-to-boycott-nutella-for-the-environment-says-greenpeace/) for using only palm oil that has been certified by the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil. Like many environmental issues, palm oil isn't a zero-sum, black and white problem.\n",

The kit kat bars do have palm kernel oil which may be derived from the same source, but then again those ones don't have an allergen warning for nut allergies, so I guess that's the trade off for having something to give to the kids that have nut sensitivity. That, and it always makes me feel cool to give out full size candy bars\n\nI've always thought that candies specifically for Halloween and Easter and Christmas and Valentine's Day were lower quality than normal candies sold year round, so seeing this article kinda makes me feel vindicated",

It's practically tasteless, so other ingredients can show off their own taste, and if it's used in soap or cosmetics it won't taste like food. It's very good for creating a creamy consistency that's harder to achieve with other oils. Like nutella or similar semi-liquids. Using palm oil probably increases general taste and quality of a lot of foods. However, that's not true if you just use it as a filler that replaces other ingredients. And you can use it like that because it doesn't taste anything. Since its cheap it makes the product cheaper to create than with real ingredients that have taste.",

When demand for these other oils grow, what do you think farmers and plantations in developing countries will do? They\u2019ll clear even more forests to farm it. Oil Palm produces about 12 to 13 times the vegetable oil yield of Soy (same amount of land over the same time). Even in Brazil there are issues about them clearing forests for soy farming and calls for sustainable soy farming.\n\nWe\u2019ll just be replacing one evil with a worse evil.

The problem I was trying to address is a global issue. There are few jungles and rainforests left, and wildlife is dying at an alarming rate.  \n\nYes, the US is the worst in terms of our energy consumption. I\u2019m very ashamed that we have a president and administration which seeks to take us backwards.  We have so much wealth in the US, we feel entitled to continue using up the world\u2019s resources even as it warms the oceans and pollutes the air. It\u2019s only when Americans leave the US and travel that we see the larger impact on the world. \n\nIt\u2019s a complex topic, but I think it is up to all of us to work together to save what is left of jungles, rainforests, animals, birds, and insects. It\u2019s not about asking the people of Malaysia to have less, it\u2019s about finding ways to protect national resources. All countries should share in this burden. Countries like the US should contribute financially to this effort. \n\nBtw, Malaysia *is* one of the most beautiful and interesting countries in the world. And, you are so fortunate to have such a great variety of food. When we visit all our family and friends take us to the \u201cbest laksa\u201d or the \u201cbest ice kacang.\u201d This last trip we were there during durian season which was a treat. \n\nPeace",

They make smarter decisions about the products they buy, and this causes products made in unsustainable ways to become unprofitable.  This forces larger companies to find cheaper ways of producing their products sustainably, and creates room for smaller companies to discover, occupy and expand niches through innovation of sustainable production techniques.  In the end, the consumer pays the same amount, the environment benefits, smaller companies benefit, and larger companies continue to make large profits.\n\nIf we do this from the top-down, government regulations eat into profits, forcing large companies to find ways to skirt the regulations through the cunning use of lawyers, bribes paid to foreign governments and creative accountants.  This also raises barriers to entry for smaller companies, who will be forced to charge higher prices for their niche products due to the need to prove to government regulators that their innovative, sustainable production techniques are within regulations.  This also opens the system to abuse, as regulators tend to move through revolving doors between large companies in the industry and government regulation jobs.  In the end, consumers pay higher prices, the environment continues to be ruined, and large companies increase their profits by using government to squeeze smaller companies out of the market.\n\nIt's really on each of us to be smart and to do the right thing.  I know that's asking quite a lot, but it has been done, before.  Tobacco smoking, for example, is not ending because of government regulation or taxation of it, but because consumers (particularly younger generations) are better-educated about the dangers of smoking, and are making smarter decisions.",

The prison complex earns a ton of money keeping people locked up though. For profit prisons end up having the effect of incentivsing incarceration and keeping prisons full.\n\nIt's completely logical from a sociopathic viewpoint I guess. In all other senses it's completely maddening consider the cost and detriment to society. Mexico is getting fucked over by this, not to mention all the other countries in similar situations.",
