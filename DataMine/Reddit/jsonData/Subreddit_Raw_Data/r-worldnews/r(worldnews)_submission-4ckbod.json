One, the baby boomers nearly *all* of whose end-goal was some variation of \"get/make more money/things\". To that end, a stunning percentage of that generation threw the ethics/rules out the window and chased their wants.\n\nThe other generation is a combination of generations that has come after them. A significantly large percentage of this combination of generations really, really does care about the environment, understands the consequences of climate change, corruption, and has at some point (school, university, job) experienced malpractices/corruption/exasperation from the effects of the boomer generation. \n\nWe are by-and-large fed up with corruption at every level of every authority, whether it's outright corruption (bribing, threats, etc), subdued corruption (coercion, use of power to deny, etc), or a much more subtle corruption (nepotism, cronyism or hate-filled phobias, etc).\n\nI do believe we are at a turning point - I am reminded of the dark days of the American revolution, like Valley Forge and just after, when things were hopeless. But now, as in back then, we're not giving up, because we realize that somewhere, at some point this has to stop. The turning point is mainly in technology - solar and nuclear/electric power will be the turning points that will have the O&G industry collapse onto itself.\n\nI believe. I will always believe. And I won't stop until we've preserved the Earth as it should have been for the future.\n\nEDIT: Wow, did not expect gold for that. Thank you, kind redditor. :)",

    "body": "That's my biggest question here actually. I'm trying to see these emails myself, why can't we see them? Did I just miss where they linked the emails?\n\n**Edit** - thanks to the responses of a few ppl (ty u/dkesh and u/Accujack), I guess there actually are valid reasons to not want to make this info public right away. To summarize it as quickly as possible, tho **[dkesh sums it up pretty well here](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/4ckbod/hundreds_of_thousands_of_leaked_emails_reveal/d1j36yz)** *and* **[accujack goes a bit deeper into the risk/reward scenario the reporter/station is in](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/4ckbod/hundreds_of_thousands_of_leaked_emails_reveal/d1j3pf0)**, the basic consensus is this - revealing information too quickly can put you into a compromising position unless you have all your chips aligned right.\n\nMeaning, say you do make this leak public the second it becomes available to you, but what if the leaks, when reported, just lead to general acceptance of the facts without generating enough research to be damning in court? Meaning, what if the leak you've made isn't strong enough to be used as evidence in court without properly stringing together the importance of each piece of info? Cuz if you don't tie it all together in a nice and easy to understand bow that is undeniable to the reader, then the company being accused can start covering their tracks now that they can see what the news station has on them. It's basically timing your shot just right to make sure you get the maximum effectiveness and take this company's bad practices down for good. Lol, now obviously, even I know that this prolly won't punish the individuals responsible, let alone the company's involvement in bribery, but it'll surely be throwing shade on the companies involved, and that could potentially be used in the future if they get caught again as reference to past crimes and bribery. The point is, they want to take as damaging a shot as possible, so they're going to be patient and make sure they match things up perfectly. At least, this is the basic summary I've been told.\n\nSounds legitimate to me, tho I still think this should have ALL been done earlier. Either that, or wait until later to announce it. The fact that they already announced that they had info without giving any damning info is going to give companies opportunities to cover their tracks from the getgo. You can delete entire backups of email servers in a few hours, so the fact that they would announce it like this without coming out with anything to hold the company down with troubles me. Why announce it in the first place? What do you hope to gain by announcing it now instead of later? TO give an analogy, imagine you're playing ~~Blackjack~~ Poker. You have a good hand, a DAMN good hand. The idiotic move would be to start laughing out loud and going all in. You don't want everyone to fold or only put in the minimum amount of money. You want them to operate as usual and let them put in their normal amount, then punish them when they least expect it. Obviously, it's not a 1-1 analogy, and something that's idiotic in ~~Blackjack~~ Poker might make perfect sense in journalism, but I'm still not 100% convinced.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on all of this?\n\n**EDIT2 -____- I messed up Blackjack with Poker. Shows how much I know about card games. I'll hold this L.**\n\nAnyhoo, there were a SHIT TON of you with the responses, and I sincerely appreciate all 20 something of you for commenting. To sum up a few comments that I thought were worth throwing on this edit....\n\nApparently, this ties in pretty well with the movie Spotlight. I haven't seen it, but a couple of redditors recommended it, saying that the idea of waiting for the right moment so that they could snag ALL involved was a very powerful tactic that was really well explored in the movie. Unfortunately, the film is not on Netflix, but it is a damn good film according to them.\n\nOne comment that REALLY caught my attention, u/lua_x_ia made a fantastic comment [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/4ckbod/hundreds_of_thousands_of_leaked_emails_reveal/d1j9z9j?context=3) that explained what I'm trying to say in better detail with a better analogy to boot.\n\nAnd lastly, u/richertai came in with a [rather cool quote from Spider Jerusalem](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/4ckbod/hundreds_of_thousands_of_leaked_emails_reveal/d1j8zvs?context=3). I love that quote.",

    "body": "**edit**  For the MANY people asking what they can do:\n1.  Educate yourself and become involved politically.\n2.  Support groups like earthjustice.org and beyondpesticides.org\n/edit\n\nI suspect this type of activity is systemic across every major industry.  Let's look at the pesticide industry, shall we?  Most people don't understand just how problematic pesticides are not just for the environment and farm workers, but our entire society.  Did you know that one of the most popular families of pesticides used in conventional agriculture, organophosphates, has been widely implicated in severe developmental neurotoxicity issues in children?  As these studies showcase, these pesticides, found in normal amounts in children, not children with high exposure, are implicated in reduced IQ and cognitive abilities:\n\n- http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21507778\n- http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21507776\n- http://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/1003160/\n- http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2010/05/17/peds.2009-3058.full.pdf+html\n- http://www.ucdmc.ucdavis.edu/publish/news/newsroom/8978\n- http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26057254\n\nTake a few minutes to ponder the ramifications; the food we eat may literally be making us dumber.  And yes, food is a major pesticide source despite what industry might claim: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18414640 and http://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/1408197/.  Continuing on, the most important enzyme responsible for breaking down these pesticides in the human body is called serum paraoxanase.  Some people have a lot of paraoxanase activity and are able to break down the pesticides really fast.  Guess which subpopulation scientists are beginning to find has significantly reduced paraoxanase activity?  People with autism: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16297937 -- and this year a large study found associations between organophosphates and autism: http://www.ucdmc.ucdavis.edu/publish/news/newsroom/8978.  More work needs to be done on this front, but the early findings are concerning to say the least.\n\nThe data against organophosphates continues to pile up and has resulted in the thousands of scientists represented by the Union of Concerned Scientists wanting organophosphates banned.  Unfortunately, politics wins at the EPA: http://www.ucsusa.org/our-work/center-science-and-democracy/promoting-scientific-integrity/epa-and-pesticides.html\n\nI only spoke of the neurotoxicity issues above.  Make no mistake, these pesticides cause harm across a variety of spectrums.  Not just on children's nervous systems but everything from gestation duration and birthweight to reduced lung function and lower sperm count in humans to changing the behavior of bugs.  Some example studies:\n\n- http://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/1104615/\n- http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25413219\n- http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2015/03/pesticides-result-in-lower-sperm-counts/\n- http://news.berkeley.edu/2015/12/03/breathing-capacity-pesticide-exposure/\n\nPlease be sure to also look at the studies showcasing that these products are \"safe\".  I'd suggest starting with Naled, an organophosphate.  The 2006 EPA reregistration document is here: http://archive.epa.gov/pesticides/reregistration/web/pdf/naled_red.pdf) and you'll find the list of utilized, \"Studies\" begins on page 105.  You will also find that 98% of those studies are conducted by the chemical manufacturers themselves (in rats and rabbits) and, \"Unpublished\" meaning they never underwent peer review.  Yet when independent scientists conduct studies, they are finding what I posted above, in children.\n\nAs the Union of Concerned Scientists stated in the link I posted above, \"Another scientist said that the agency \"often ignored independent scientific studies that contradicted the industry-subsidized study.\" Especially in cases where chemicals' effects on health are poorly understood and studies disagree, said the scientist, the EPA should not automatically side with the pesticide industry. \"If there is disagreement, doesn't that cry out for further research?\" A report of the EPA Office of the Inspector General also suggested that the EPA had not done enough to protect children from pesticide exposure.\"\n\nThe Naled reregistration document proves this as, of the 91 cited studies, all but one were conducted by industry and unpublished.\n\nDespite countless scientists calling for change, greed and regulatory capture hold the winning hand.  And it is the common man who suffers.  Whether it be oil or pesticides, those in power have placed their chess pieces over the years in a masterful game and at this point, one has to wonder if we have to simple concede check mate.\n\n**edit** As long as this post is getting the attention it is, allow me to elaborate on how bad it gets.  Remember the pesticide Naled (an organophosphate) I spoke of above?  It is also sprayed over millions of people in the name of mosquito control.  When sprayed on agriculture fields, there is a 48 hour reentry interval where workers cannot reenter without protective gear (http://archive.epa.gov/pesticides/reregistration/web/pdf/naled_red.pdf).  When it is sprayed over residential areas for mosquito control, there are no such protections; kids are out running around the same day.  The thing is, when sprayed in agriculture fields, they use large droplets so it contacts the bugs.  When sprayed for mosquitoes, they aerosolize it so it hangs in the air.  The problem there is, the US military figured out in a study that aerosolized Naled is 21x more toxic and causes lung and liver necrosis (http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF01685774) -- In other words, 155lb farm workers can't enter an area it is sprayed for 48 hours but 30lb kids are out the same day despite their form potentially being upwards of 21x more toxic than what the farm workers are suscepted to.\n\n**edit2** a good response was made to my edit shown here: https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/4ckbod/hundreds_of_thousands_of_leaked_emails_reveal/d1j5n10 that I haven't had time to research but I feel it's only fair to provide both sides of the argument here.  Frankly, I'd love to be wrong about the mosquito control aspect so would love others to comment on his response.\n\n",

And certainly these non-Arab companies aren't giving the local population a dime in exchange.\n\nThe theory is that rich oil companies hire \"lobbying\" firms like Unaoil to go into places like Iraq and Syria and bribe the officials there to sell the oil rights to certain zones.  The bribe likely consists of a \"kickback\" - that is, you give us the oil rights, let us take whatever we want out of the ground, and we pay your family a stipend of $X million per year over the course of 10 years.  That stipend then comes out of the books of a Unaoil contractor or subcontractor, so that what has actually happened is very hard to detect - unless you have e-mails from the sources admitting it...",

Essentially all these third-world countries have natural resources at their disposal, and wealthy businessmen want to exploit them.  In communist countries, the government may keep the natural resources for public use.  Those governments have to be toppled if they're unwilling to play ball.  Then a capitalist government (or more often just a dictator) will be installed instead.  They'll privatize the national resources so that big business can come in and drain them for profit.\n\nCompanies still use government and diplomacy to do their bidding, but they can also bribe these countries directly.  If you pay off enough of a local parliament/congress, then they can vote to allow you access to their resources.  They sell it to their people as development.  It'll create jobs and prosperity!  But they're really doing it because the company is paying them directly.\n\nThen you look at Cuba, which we were never successfully able to overthrow.  The communist government seized lots of foreign assets and made it clear they were not willing to be a capitalist haven.  So the capitalist world responded with a trade embargo to stifle their economy and technological progress.\n\nThis means the best option for most foreign governments is to go along with corruption.  This way they at least benefit from it, because if you don't accept the bribes and do what they want, they'll find another way to get to it.  That was the case with the Iraq war. ",

Not all leaks are like Wikileaks where they show up in public for everyone to see, and in fact that's unusual.\n\nHistorically, leaked information hasn't been massive databases but rather tips and messages which required media agencies/reporters to pursue the story and piece together what truth was possible based on the leaked information and public information.\n\nNowadays it's more common to get a data dump, which it may make sense to simply publish, or it may not.  In the case where the information is damning but requires organization and processing before e.g. it becomes obvious what's going on, a reporter won't just release it, because that starts a timer - as soon as it's revealed what was leaked, those people involved will start to hide/cover their tracks, which makes the leaked information less effective.  If your end goal is to stop whatever behavior is described by the leak, what you want to do is present the information in understandable chunks to the public to prove what's happening but hold back something so if retribution happens not everything has been ~~hidden~~ revealed.\n\n**TL, DR;**  This data isn't public, and probably won't be for a while if ever, because making it all public gives the people involved time to hide/delete/cover their tracks.  Just dumping data on the public can be worthless depending on how complex the problem is.\n",

There's a deal going on right now in Papua New Guinea to develop the first deep sea mining operation, called Solwara 1.  The company involved is Nautilus Minerals, from Canada.  The total profit for them over the course of the 30-month operation is estimated at around $900 million.  Total economic benefit for PNG is estimated at around $142 million, with a Community Development Fund of just $1.5 million over 30 months.  Sounds like a pretty crappy deal if you are agreeing to be the test subject for a novel mining method.  Negotiations haven't completed, so number are changing still but that's the kind of situation that exists.\nThen what happens to the wealth inherent in the natural resource, be it oil/minerals/whatever?  It is taken away from the country.  The exploited country gets some income in taxes, etc. but like the article proves, the bribes are taken by a few top government officials!  Very little of the income from allowing their oil fields to be drilled/mountains mined/etc actually gets in to the pockets of average people!  Gahhhh!\n\nPoorer countries sell off their natural resources with very limited environmental regulations to make a buck, and some companies prey on them, which only further serves to undermine the less-developed country's economy and keep them down.  Of course things don't always go like this and I'm sure there are examples of fantastic deals where the host country really benefits and the foreign company invests in their economy and everyone wins.... but it is definitely a pattern that exists.",

I would routinely fail samples of a certain product, only for the LC/MS and/or GC/MS spectra to magically disappear in an identical shipment 1 week later.\n\nWhen products are detained from the port, they are still shipped to their destined warehouse &amp; the sit on FDA hold until a sample collector, such as myself, gathers ~10 lbs of product to test at the lab. I test it, give a thumbs up or down, send a report to the FDA, &amp; then they either release it or refuse it.\n\nNow, the matter in which I believe this whole procedure to be corrupt lies in the warehouses and the farms the product initially comes from:\n\nThe farms usually have \"clean\" sections and \"dirty\" sections. If you get caught, you have to make 5 consecutive \"clean\" shipments &amp; then you're off the FDA's shit list &amp; can ship large amounts of product without excess scrutiny. A shipment has to be a minimum of 10 cases, so I'll constantly be testing 10-box shipments 5 weeks in a row from a company that typically sends 1000's of cases/shipment. These small shipments are always pristine, &amp; subsequently the company is swiftly taken off FDA detention. The analytical spectra for these small shipments look nothing like their regular shipments, which leads me to believe that there are separate farms for clean shipments and dirty shipments.\n\nThe other problem lies in the fact that if you're caught, your product sits at your own warehouse under your own supervision during the whole FDA detention process. If my whole warehouse is full of papayas, &amp; I know some papayas are going to be tested that are dirty, I'll just swap them with the clean papayas I have in-house before the sample collector comes by. Keep in mind that I can't just show up &amp; collect papayas whenever I want all willy-nilly, it's the warehouse that sets the date &amp; time for sample collection. As a whole, that's a fully corruptible procedure that needs to be changed.\n\nOh, and the whole \"organic\" labels put on products mean nothing to me, &amp; they should mean nothing to you either. I've failed just as many organic samples as I have regular samples for shit like azoxystrobin, imazalil, difenoconazole (popular one), carbendazim (really popular one), dicofol, phoxim, &amp; like 80 others. \n",

However, you only present one side of the issue. Do you think we spray pesticides on crops just for fun, so some \"evil\" corporation can  just make more money? Pesticides kill crop destroying pests, NOT using them would be much worse because your entire crop could be lost. It's a trade-off, like everything else in life, that you wholly ignore as if there is some ever present equally effective option that's swept under the rug by \"evil\" corporations. There isn't, and it's not. I'd rather have a crop with pesticide than no crop at all. Because in developing nations, that means people die. Same thing with spraying for mosquito's, you don't mention what happens when they don't spray, so I'll let you know, more people die from malaria. \n\nNow back to the bribery. Of course it happens. It's *the* way a lot business is done in developing/non democratic countries. If a Nigerian official wants a bribe for a contract, there's nothing you can do about that. The first person/company to give him that bribe wins the contract. Do you expect some businessman to just walk away from a potential deal because he doesn't agree with some ideology? Nope, not gonna happen because there are 20 other people in line to take that same deal. If you don't, you get replaced. It's just the way it goes. \n\nSeriously, I wish redditors made more of an effort to make balanced arguments, not just \"oh look this is soo against my ideology (and therefor evil), we should not do that anymore and punish anyone who does.\" Do you really generate your worldview by looking at each issue through a microscope while ignoring the big picture?

Many of my family members are medical professionals, and a lot of them suspect that his exposure to pesticides may have been what caused his Parkinson's disease. I understand that when you watch a loved one suffer from any debilitating disease you want to find a reason, but knowing that he was putting out those kinds of chemicals with his bare hands makes me inclined to agree. Apparently there have been some studies possibly linking the two.",

All of these countries have significant petroleum taxes and most (perhaps all?) have large national oil companies, which operate the majority of wells. Additionally, where possible, they employ the local population (admittedly at pay rates that you likely find insufficient, but that's a separate topic). Arab spring was much more about a general lack of civil liberties as well as this oil money enriching dictators/states which neither reinvested well into the local economy nor covered basic human necessities for its people.

I know that a few years ago  the US passed a law stating they they would impound ANY ship coming out of Cuban waters, not just American registered ones, and a number of countries were not happy with this decision. My father is a snowbird and goes to his sailboat based out of Florida every winter. He sometimes sails in the Caribbean and one year he spent a few months in Cuba.

They were paying the military to conduct raids on innocent protesters homes and ended up hanging innocent protest leaders in order to suppress the protesting against Shell.\n\n\nMy username is my attempt at education via a spoof on the Human Rights Abuses by Shell Oil in the Niger Delta region of Nigeria.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFor more information about Shell in Nigeria, please look at the sources below.\n\nhttp://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/dec/08/wikileaks-cables-shell-nigeria-spying\n\n>The oil giant Shell claimed it had inserted staff into all the main ministries of the Nigerian government, giving it access to politicians' every move in the oil-rich Niger Delta, according to a leaked US diplomatic cable.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Saro-Wiwa\n\n>His death provoked international outrage and the immediate suspension of Nigeria from the Commonwealth of Nations, as well as the calling back of many foreign diplomats for consultation. The United States and other countries considered imposing economic sanctions.\n\n>Beginning in 1996, the Center for Constitutional Rights (CCR), EarthRights International (ERI), Paul Hoffman of Schonbrun, DeSimone, Seplow, Harris & Hoffman and other human rights attorneys have brought a series of cases to hold Shell accountable for alleged human rights violations in Nigeria, including summary execution, crimes against humanity, torture, inhumane treatment and arbitrary arrest and detention. The lawsuits are brought against Royal Dutch Shell and Brian Anderson, the head of its Nigerian operation.[15]\n\n>The United States District Court for the Southern District of New York set a trial date of June 2009. On 9 June 2009 Shell agreed to an out-of-court settlement of $15.5 million USD to victims' families. However, the company denied any liability for the deaths, stating that the payment was part of a reconciliation process.[16] In a statement given after the settlement, Shell suggested that the money was being provided to the relatives of Saro-Wiwa and the eight other victims, in order to cover the legal costs of the case and also in recognition of the events that took place in the region.[17] Some of the funding is also expected to be used to set up a development trust for the Ogoni people, who inhabit the Niger Delta region of Nigeria.[18] The settlement was made just days before the trial, which had been brought by Ken Saro-Wiwa's son, was due to begin in New York.[17]\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiwa_family_lawsuits_against_Royal_Dutch_Shell\n\n>On June 8, 2009, Shell settled out-of-court with the Saro-Wiwa family for $15.5 million.[3][4] Ben Amunwa, director of the Remember Saro-Wiwa organization, said that \"No company, that is innocent of any involvement with the Nigeria military and human rights abuses, would settle out of court for 15.5 million dollars. It clearly shows that they have something to hide\".[5]\n\nhttp://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/oct/03/shell-oil-paid-nigerian-military\n\n>Shell oil paid Nigerian military to put down protests, court documents show\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAnother article - http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/niger/5413171/Shell-execs-accused-of-collaboration-over-hanging-of-Nigerian-activist-Ken-Saro-Wiwa.html\n\n\nShort 10 min documentary about it - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htF5XElMyGI - The Case Against Shell: 'The Hanging of Ken Saro-Wiwa Showed the True Cost of Oil'\n",

The companies and people listed in the news article need to be compared against *every* candidate's donation list as well as against the lists of donations to Super PACs.\n\n2d EDIT:  As /u/hall_residence notes below, Raein also appears in today's news article as KBR's \"middleman\" in Azerbaijan, who had access to \"every office in the country.\"\n\n\n",

How dare you accuse the Clintons of taking political bribes in the form of paid speaking events.  As a business man myself, I can tell you with certainty........if I had money to spare, there's no question the first investment I'd make would be to pay a former President or Secretary of State $200k - $300k to speak to my employees for a whole hour.  Do you realize how much more motivated, inspired, productive, and efficient people after they've heard a former President or former Secretary of State talk for a solid hour?  There's no way investing $200k+ into equipment, R&D, technology, hiring, product development, etc could produce the same level of windfall.  So, how dare you think those $200k/hr speeches anything other than a brilliant investment by companies looking to inspire their work force.  /s",

    "body": "Peacefully opting out has become my strategy.  It is the long game, but in the end, I feel it is the right one.  Basically I do everything I can to limit my use of fossil fuel, which is obviously very hard right now, but also industrialized food, any product that comes directly from exploited labor, also not easy, and just in general try to be careful who I give my money, time, and resources to.  And the answer is, yes, I am living on the edge of western white america as a transient migrant laborer, but one with a clean conscience.  There is the fact, too, that with my diet and all of the labor that goes into not only what I do for money, but simply what it takes to live a less materialistic life, I am in the best health I have ever been.  I passed college entrance exams too, so it isn't like I had no choice to such a lifestyle.  It all sounds like I am bragging online, which I am, but I really just want to illustrate that you don't need to, and really shouldn't resort to violence to solve all the problems people are talking about in this thread.\n\nTo bring it to the philosophical side, the people you suggest we tear apart, have power in a million and one ways over us before we get to their actual physical self.  By changing the environment around them, around all of us, we can more tactfully disrupt their power, while empowering ourselves at the same time.  The slogan here is vote with your dollar, but you can also vote with your actions, so to speak.  Produce your own food, mend your clothing, keep localizing your economies in ways that lift up people who provide a positive outcome to the community and environment.  Don't be swayed by greedy advertisements.  Drive less (*gasps*).  Resorting to violence when they hold the cards plays right into their hand.  Resorting to cut them off from the flow of funding and cheap labor forces their bluff.\n\nSadly, yes sadly, eventually, in the world we have currently, I personally see a lot of violence still directed at all of us peaceful non-participators.  If some people end up fighting and dying to protect a peaceful way of life, I won't look down on that, knowing the circumstances, which again, is never easy to do.  But if we are to have a fighting chance at changing the system, we will need backing, support, real world, tangible, calorie rich, warm, clean, healthy support.  One HUGE reason the 'masses' don't rise up and fight the powers that be is that even if they won outright, they would have no idea what to do or where to go.  When someone holds that many cards, sometimes you have to leave the table, and hope for better luck at the next one, and don't get your head smashed in by the bouncers.",

I have a lot of books that make some very good cases for how we can begin to move forward. I've been starting up at practicing permaculture and attempting to start degridding my own household, if only to act as a model, in the hope that maybe the work of people who do this stuff early on can help make a larger transition more easy for the rest of us in the future. \n\nOn top of all that I am trying to spread the idea of how we can utilize memetics (not internet jokes, but the science of how ideas spread) to attempt to wake people up to this sort of thing, or get them thinking about it more.  \n\nI think that such a thing can happen if we get enough people interested in this sort of thing. The companies that rule our world are corrupt, and meanwhile there are ways the people can start to move forward and take back some of our power and autonomy from the system as it exists. Let's spark a discussion on how to get this sort of thing rolling.",
