    "body": "Lawyer here.  Not a constitutional law lawyer, but lawyer enough.  I read the decision and it is astounding to me that the DOJ would argue that the judicial branch has no authority to review executive decisions on national security.  That's crazy.  I thought that news articles saying that is what the DOJ was arguing were just hyperbole.  Nope, the DOJ argued that.  Think about that for a minute.  That could mean that the president can give executive orders having to do with national security and take away people's rights and it is unreviewable by the courts.  You know why that doesn't sound right?  Because no case ever has held that!  In fact, it is the opposite.  Courts routinely do this type of review.  While the president gets deference on national security (and a good chunk of it), there is always judicial review. It goes against our very notion of separation of powers to argue otherwise.  I would never make that argument.  I suspect that they felt that they had to make it because they knew that if the order was reviewed it would be struck down because it was written so broadly.  \n\nAlso, think about this, an injunctive relief was upheld despite the fact that the president gets so much deference.  The bar for injunctive relief is generally very high (although roles were a bit reversed for this decision) AND the president gets deference and he still lost.  \n\nThey also argued at one point that \"aliens\" don't have due process rights.  Yes, they do.  The term aliens extends to anyone who is not a US Citizen. So green card holders, people on visas, etc.  It was the government's position that they did not have due process rights.  Wow.  \n\nThis is why Sally Yates sent that internal memo.  These arguments are nuts.  Believe it or not, lawyers can't just argue whatever they want in court.  Our arguments have to be grounded in law and fact.  \n\nEdited for clarity.",

    "body": "Great comment by u/pxalt from this same story on r/news.\n\nQuick thoughts as I go through the [opinion](https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/3457898/2-9-17-9th-Circuit-Order.pdf):\n\n- The most important thing for everybody to keep in mind is that the court is **NOT** making a final determination as to whether Trump's Executive Order is legal. The court is determining whether the lower district court's order blocking the EO should be stayed *temporarily* while the district court makes its actual decision. To decide, the court considers four factors:\n\n> 1. Whether the people asking for the stay of the district court's order have a decent chance of succeeding on the legal merits,\n> 2. Whether the people asking for the stay will be seriously harmed if the stay is denied,\n> 3. Whether granting the stay will harm anybody, and\n> 4. Where the public interest lies.\n\n**Factor #1:** the court rules that the federal government failed to prove that it could succeed on the merits, because the Executive Order fails to provide due process (such as notice and a hearing) for people like LPRs (green card holders) and people with lawful visas whose travel has now been restricted. The court notes that right now the government has the burden, and they've failed to meet it (in other words: The federal government had to convince the court that they *could* ultimately win on the legal merits. The plaintiffs didn't have to convince the court that the federal government *couldn't*.) This is important, because it means that the federal government had a harder job than the plaintiffs. It doesn't mean that the federal government can *never* win on the merits, just that they didn't win today.\n\nThe government argued that the Green Card issue is no big deal, because White House counsel clarified that the order won't apply to LPRs. But the court isn't buying it -- White House lawyers can't overrule the plain language of the Executive Order, so what they have to say about the EO after the fact is irrelevant. Plus, the White House has changed its mind a bunch of times on what the EO means, so we're not going to judge it based on what they happen to be saying about it today.\n\n**The court punts on religious discrimination**: The question is whether the Executive Order amounts to religious discrimination based on President Trump's previous comments regarding a \"Muslim ban.\" Trump surrogates have argued that the court should consider only the language within the four corners of the Executive Order, and shouldn't consider extraneous information like what Trump and Giuliani have said elsewhere. The court at least isn't having that. \"It is well established that **evidence of purpose beyond the face of the challenged law may be considered** in evaluating Establishment and Equal Protection Clause claims.\" But then...the court backs off. \"In light of the sensitive interests involved, the pace of the current emergency proceedings, and our conclusion that the Government has not met its burden of showing likelihood of success on appeal on its arguments with respect to the due process claim, we reserve consideration of these claims until the merits of this appeal have been fully briefed.\"\n\n**Factor #2:** \"The Government has pointed to no evidence that any alien from any of the countries named in the Order has perpetrated a terrorist attack in the United States.\"\n\n**Factor #3:** \"the States have offered ample evidence that if the Executive Order were reinstated even temporarily, it would substantially injure the States and multiple other parties interested in the proceeding.\" University students and employees were harmed, families were separated, residents of Washington and Minnesota (the suing states) were stranded abroad. Good enough for the court.\n\n**Factor #4:** The public interest favors both sides, but based on the prior factors we've made our decision. Appeal denied.\n\n**Other thoughts:**\n\n- The government says that if the court *is* going to enforce the stay, they should only enforce it as to people who are/were lawfully in the country and want to go somewhere else and come back. The court says no. Even people who are *illegally* in the country have constitutional due process rights. We're not going to forget about them.\n\n- The court takes particular offense to the government's claim that decisions made by the President concerning immigration are \"unreviewable\" by the judiciary. The court counters that such a claim has no legal precedent, and \"runs contrary to the fundamental structure of our constitutional democracy.\"\n\n- The court agrees that the judiciary traditionally \"counsels deference\" to the Executive branch in matters of national security. However, \"authority and expertise in [such] matters do not automatically trump the Court\u2019s own obligation to secure the protection that the Constitution grants to\nindividuals.\" I'd love to say that the choice of the word \"trump\" was intentional, but the court was citing a SCOTUS case from 2010. Still.\n\n- \"[N]ational defense\u2019 cannot be deemed an end in itself, justifying any exercise of legislative power designed to promote such a goal. . . . It would indeed be\nironic if, in the name of national defense, we would sanction the subversion of one of those liberties . . . which makes the defense of the Nation worthwhile.\" The court here citing *United States v. Robel*, (1967).\n\nNote that while I am a lawyer, I am **not** a constitutional lawyer or an immigration lawyer. Take what I say with a grain of salt.\n \nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/5t3n5c/court_of_appeal_decision_continues_injunction_on/ddjyodf",

The panel denied the stay per curiam, (EDIT: usually) meaning unanimously (EDIT: the actual definition is closer to \"acting unanimously,\" but practically speaking it means it was unsigned and therefore the opinion of the court as a whole, and not the opinion of any one judge). Each of the three judges on the panel was appointed by a different President - 2 Democrats, and 1 Republican.\n\n\n2. The Court found that the states of Washington and Minnesota had standing to sue because of the harm the Executive Order (\"EO\") does to its public universities and those students. Public education for the fucking win.\n\n\n3. The ruling is limited to the propriety of the District Court's temporary restraining order (\"TRO\") halting the EO, NOT the constitutionality of the EO itself. In my opinion this was a huge strategic error on part of the feds, because the analysis for TROs (and injunctions in general) is way different than the analysis of the substantive underlying issues.\n\n\n4. The feds argued that the President's decisions about immigration policy, particularly when motivated by national security concerns, are UNREVIEWABLE. The Court found, rightly, that the President does not and never has had any such unlimited right. (My opinion) This goes against the very tenets of our Constitution, namely separation of powers into co-equal branches, and checks and balances on those branches. Those are the types of things dictators say. But in America, \"[i]t is emphatically the duty and province of the judiciary to say what the law is.\" - Chief Justice Marshall, Marbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. 137, 177 (1803).\n\n\n5. The essence of the holding is that the feds failed to meet the first two criteria for an emergency stay, i.e. whether 1) they have shown a strong likelihood of success on the merits of the underlying issue, and 2) they will be irreparably harmed by the absence of the stay. In other words, the Court basically said \"you haven't proven that you would win, and it's not going to hurt you to wait until we sort this out.\"\n\n\n6. The feds argued NOT that the executive order properly allows for due process rights for those affected by it, but rather THOSE PEOPLE ARE NOT ENTITLED TO DUE PROCESS. Again, that is what dictators say.\n\n\n7. The Court declined to modify the scope of the TRO. Meaning that it still applies nationwide to the EO. They write, \"even if the TRO might be overbroad in some respects, it is not our role to try, in effect, to rewrite the Executive Order.\"\n\nEDIT: /u/conklech correctly pointed out my (misspelled) definition of per curiam was not entirely accurate.",

It becomes really hard for them to argue that these people who have already been vetted by the system, need to be banned out of the country until further notice despite not having any reason to be other than nationality.\n\nBut even if they can get past that argument-- intent is a huge part of this as well. While Trump and supporters claim the intent is to protect Americans from terrorism, comments made by Trump show the intent is a religious one. And we all know, that's also unconstitutional. This leads the judge(s) to the question: does comments outside of the EO show underlying malicious intent towards a specific religion or should we read the EO on surface value? With how much Trump has said, tweeted, etc. about it being a Muslim ban- it's going to be very difficult if the judge(s) take everything into consideration.",

It was the 9th circuit that handed out the stay, so DOJ had to appeal to the 9th circuit to get the stay overturned (circuit courts can't overturn decisions from different circuits) - either that, or wait for a different circuit to issue an appealable decision.\n\n> Getting it appealed before his sup ct nomination goes on the bench?\n\nThe SCOTUS confirmation will take weeks, if not months, so it would be useless for overturning the stay, assuming they would even take up the case at this stage. Most likely outcome of a SCOTUS appeal is SCOTUS will decline to hear it until the case is fully litigated in the lower courts (SCOTUS is incredibly busy, and they have little interest in ruling on temporary stays, just to have to hear arguments on the same matter again a few months later).",

    "body": "Aight. I'll do my best.\n\nA few years ago, President Obama issued executive orders on immigration. They said, basically, that the Executive Branch would not be enforcing some of the immigration laws created by Congress. (This could be a whoooole other ELI5).\n\nThese executive orders were challenged by several states. The 5th Circuit declared them unconstitutional, in large part because of the Take Care Clause of the 10th Amendment. This case is known as *Texas v. US*.\n\nNow it's really hard to ELI5 the Take Care Clause, because it's almost never used in court. But the theory proposed by the states was that the Take Care Clause requires the president to make a good-faith effort to enforce the laws. As such, any official order to hold back on the enforcement of a law is unconstitutional.\n\nThis went to the Supreme Court. Since Justice Scalia had died, and not been replaced, the Court only had 8 members. The case came down to a tie: 4-4. But SCOTUS does not use NFL overtime rules. In the case of a tie, the lower court decision is upheld. That's what happened here. \n\nFlash forward to Now. President Trump is issuing executive orders on immigration. They're being challenged by several states. They're being challenged on (in part) 10th Amendment grounds. That challenge is headed for the Supreme Court. Sound familiar?\n\nTrump's EOs are creating a very similar legal situation - a dark mirror of DACA. Then it was a Democratic President being challenged by red states, and now it's a Republican President being challenged by blue states. The Democrats are using the same legal challenge that they fought against *just last year*! \n\nNow, this could just be irony. OR it could be the Democrats' chickens coming home to roost. OR it could be proof that the judiciary really will protect this country from political overreach on both sides - real blind justice, adhering both to outcome and to procedure, which slows both progress and regress in equal measure, and ought to be celebrated by capslock tweets from us all. \n\nOR it could be that the Republicans arranged this exact situation. Maybe they arranged for executive orders that they knew would placate their base but get overturned by the courts. If the orders are upheld, the Trump supporters are placated, and (because we've been careful to only ban poor Muslims) few business interests are harmed. And if the orders are overturned, the Trump supporters are still placated because \"hey, we tried\", while also the Courts have set a stronger precedent that the Take Care Clause can be used to prevent executive action in immigration. So if, four years from now, President Warren tries to expand DACA again, a) the courts will shut it down and b) the Republicans can say \"but this is *your* logic, Democrats; you can't have it both ways!\"\n\nAside: something I've noticed here in Maine under Governor LePage: in general, the Center and the Left want their leaders to believe in things and then to see those things accomplished through action and legislation. The Right are happy if their leaders believe in things, even if they are so politically inept that they get none of those things accomplished. They'd rather be right than get things done. Sometimes I wonder if they might like not getting things done, so they can have something to be mad about. I think that's what we'll see when these Executive Orders get overturned: happily angry Trump supporters, PTSDd centrists and liberals, Steve Bannon remaining the Baron of Brinkmanship, and Mitch McConnell smiling like the Cheshire Cat.",

He defines that as a judge who separates his political from his constitutional preferences. But Judge Gorsuch is also more of a Jeffersonian than a Hamiltonian. **He believes in strictly construing limits on federal and presidential power in order to protect liberty.**\n\n>Justice Scalia was more of a Hamiltonian. He believed in a broad national government and judicial deference to its power to make regulations. So for those reasons, Judge Gorsuch is more likely than Justice Scalia would have been to enforce limitations on the regulatory state, to require that executive agencies go through proper procedures before passing regulations, and **he might even be more likely than Justice Scalia would have been to question executive orders issued by President Trump himself.**\n\nfrom Fresh Air: http://www.npr.org/2017/02/01/512851970/if-confirmed-would-neil-gorsuch-rule-contrary-to-trumps-policies",

    "body": "I thought not. It's not a story the Jedi would tell you. It's a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life... He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful... the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. It's ironic he could save others from death, but not himself.",
