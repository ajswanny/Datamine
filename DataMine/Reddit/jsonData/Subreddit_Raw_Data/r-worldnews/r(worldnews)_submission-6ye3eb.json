It will cost me an estimated $20 extra a month, but if I'm doing it so can others!\n\nEdit:\nI'm not sure what Reddit gold does, but thanks!\nIf anything, I would like to use this opportunity to tell everyone that it's not just small businesses that can opt in, but regular households too! Go look into your energy company and see if they offer a program.\nI'm in southern California and they have plans for 50% or 100%. Basically, the more people that enter the program, the more renewable energy they will build out to meet the demand. The cost for a regular household will probably be something like $2/month. My regular energy bill at the business is something like 500-600/month and the extra estimated charge was $20/month. Nothing! Do It!\n...seriously do it, your change in consumer demand has power.",

    "body": "PSA: BE CAREFUL WITH THESE COMPANIES AND KNOW WHAT YOU'RE BUYING! YOU CANNOT SWITCH YOUR HOME OR BUSINESS TO RENEWABLE ENERGY UNLESS YOU GO SOLAR OR BUILD ANOTHER GREEN GENERATOR!\n\n I work for an energy supplier as the head of sustainability and these \"renewable energy suppliers\" are the bane of my existence.  There is no way to change which electrons you're getting from the grid, it is simply impossible to switch to renewable energy.  What you are purchasing are Renewable Energy Certificates (RECS) equal to the amount of power you use over time.  The idea is that by purchasing RECS, you are providing additional income to renewable energy generators and most importantly encouraging investment in new generation. The issue is that studies have shown that the income from RECS, which usually only represent 1-3% of a new generators income, has a dubious and unsure impact on the go-no-go decision to build new generation.  It only has a big effect if the RECS are guaranteed by the state (like in ny now....if you live in NY YOU ARE ALREADY DOING THIS!!!).  Even then, the impact is FAR from one to one.  Most likely, you are paying extra to line to pockets of the energy company you are buying from and to a lesser extent the generator itself.\n\nEven if every person in the country switched using these companies, there would be a small impact on renewable energy generation, and nowhere CLOSE to a full switchover.\n\nThese companies will usually charge you up to an additional 0.03/kWh for the RECS when it actually costs them $0.002/kWh or less. They are taking advantage of people's good will and it sucks.  Do not give these companies money. Overall, I think the impact is negative since people think they're taken care of environmentally when the sign up and stop reducing their energy impact.\n\nLet me know if you want details on how to truly have an impact.

Regardless, it's important to ensure they are registered with the SEC in the right way (Series 65). A series 7 holder can sell you investments, but a Series 65 holder must sell you something that has your best interest in mind.\n\nMake sure you look your potential advisor up on the [SEC site](https://www.adviserinfo.sec.gov/) before working with them. You'd be surprised how many people DON'T confirm their advisors registrations before working with them.\n\nI'm sure /u/voodoodudu is legit, and I really applaud him.\n\n",
