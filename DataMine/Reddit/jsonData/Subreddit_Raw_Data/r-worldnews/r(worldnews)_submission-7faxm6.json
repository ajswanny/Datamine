I mean, they sell a bond or a share to given person and they know of that transaction, but then that person might die and leave it to someone else or sell the share and the company or government might find themselves sending money to the wrong place with no easy way to get that money back. The \"bearer\" designation basically means that the company/government doesn't give a fuck and will pay whomever sends in the right paperwork/demonstrates physical possession of the thing.\n\nThey have largely fallen out of popular usage since the early 1980's because keeping track of who owns what has gotten much easier with computers and the internet and these things are *super* prone to theft and fraud. The only real benefit left is secrecy, but that can be abused as often as its used properly.",

With regular shares you and the buyer might have to mail back and forth with a third party in say New York ( bank/company/financial instituion) which could take days, weeks or even months for a fairly simple transaction.\n\nWith bearer bonds you just literally hand them over and poof it's done. in The US they really picked up during the reconstruction era.

See also [this Tom Scott video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfSIC8jwbQs). That was a bearer bond, and its status as such is what allowed it to stay valid for centuries.\n\nWhen paper trails were thin and unreliable, and a single fire might easily wipe out entire archives, it made sense to just give the purchaser a paper and say \"this paper is your rights, it's your responsibility to keep it safe\".

    "body": "Something like that. What people don't realize is that cash is essentially a debt instrument of infinitely short duration: due on demand. A bond is usually of a longer duration, ie, due in ten years or so.\n\nThe biggest difference between a corporate bond and a US Govt treasury bond is the existence of credit risk. Credit risk is when the issuer fails to pay the investor back on maturity of the bond. The US Govt has never defaulted on a bond before, so there is essentially no credit risk of the issuer defaulting on the loan. US Debt is literally referred to as \"risk free\" and the prevailing interest rate on US bonds is referred to as the \"risk free rate\" that all other bonds of similar characteristics are compared to.\n\nThe value of a corporate bond does vary based on inflation and prevailing interest rates though. Think about it - if inflation is high, and interest rates go up accordingly, and the US govt starts selling risk free bonds that pay 10% while you are sitting on a corporate bond that only pays 5%, then your bond will be worth less than it was when you bought it. \n\nBearer bonds are just unregistered debt instruments, issued by either governments or businesses, to raise cash quick and easy. (Think about how much paperwork is involved if a business had to track every single owner of every single $1,000 bond they sold.) The USA frowns upon them though because it was too easy to launder money, smuggle it out of the country, etc. Fun fact: they didn't outright ban bearer bonds, per se. They just made the interest expense paid by the company non tax deductible for unregistered bearer bonds, which is a huge incentive for companies to finance their operations by debt instead of equity (selling more shares, contributions by owners, income from prior years, etc). This killed them off pretty effectively.\n\nSource: I'm a CPA so I know a thing or two, but just as a disclaimer I'm not a finance guy, so I'm not really a bond expert. Bonds are complicated AF! There's a lot to say about them, sorry for the wall of text.",

This is a man who bankrupted casinos!  Let that sink in...  Say what you will about his politics, Sheldon Adleson turned his casinos into a $30 billion fortune, Trump lost his shirt.  And there's no way that Trump was *cleaner* than Adelson and just lost money because he played by the rules.\n\nThere's no way in hell that pre The Apprentice Trump wins the 2016 election.  Not because his views wouldn't have been popular with the ~30% or so of the electorate that actually liked his message, but because the other Republican bystanders wouldn't ever have allowed him to get that far if people didn't have the strange notion that he was a successful businessman.  He didn't run as a great communicator leveraging his experience on television, he ran as one of the United States' greatest real estate developers which is on it's face completely absurd.",
