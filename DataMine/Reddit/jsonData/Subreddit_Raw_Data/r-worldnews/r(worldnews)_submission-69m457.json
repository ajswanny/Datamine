But does that mean the government actually has sites with child pornography images and videos, or is it fake in the sense that it ish purely made for people to click on???? It just seems kind of weird that if this were true, in order to catch the people going to these sites, you have your own content in the form of these images and videos. \n\nEdit: Holy crap thanks for all the replies!

Reportedly, during that two weeks they had control of it it was visited around **50,000 times per week** (with a membership said to be 150,000) and files continued to be downloaded en mass (\"*[accessing](https://reason.com/archives/2017/03/15/sex-and-kids) at least 48,000 photos, 200 videos and 13,000 links*\").

    "body": "Now just imagine if we weren't so afraid of pedophiles that people were afraid to even entertain the notion of trying to reach out to these people to give them alternatives, instead of just labeling them as untouchable perverts.\n\nI mean, the very idea that pedophilia itself is a crime is pretty much indefensible. Nobody wakes up one day and says \"You know what? I've decided i'm going to be sexually attracted to prepubescent children.\"\n\nWhether or not a pedophile commits an act of assault doesn't seem to matter, they're still stigmatized.\n\nAnd what's really horrifying to me as an onlooker is that even people I know who are REALLY open-minded about social issues, sexual orientation, etc., they still often say \"Yeah well I still think we should round them all up.\"\n\nIt's either a sexual orientation or it's a mental illness. It's one of those, and in either case, it's not the person's fault they are that way.\n\nDeciding to commit an act of sexual assault against a child, that's a choice, but being a pedophile is a state of being, not an action you take.\n\nI mean, look at the suicide rate for homosexual people even today. While the obvious difference is that you can have a homosexual relationship without hurting anybody, which is not the case with pedophilia, they're still the nature of being sexually and physically attracted to certain physical characteristics.\n\nSo, the question then is, how do we enable Pedophiles to satisfy those desires in a way that doesn't hurt anyone?\n\nExcept, it's not the question, because society is unwilling to even ask it.\n\nAnd in the meantime, we wonder what drives these people to abuse small children, and why we can't seem to do anything about it.\n\nDestigmatize it, give these people a platform from which to get help, and then maybe it will ACTUALLY protect our children.\n\nBut it'll never happen. We love having an evil to rail against, and there are few things better than child molesters to rail against. It helps us feel righteous. And then the tens of thousands of young children sexually assaulted each year have to pay the price for that.",

The FBI then added malware to the page that exploited vulnerability's in JavaScript to identify a tiny fraction of it's users. \n\nGenerally anyone who uses TOR (a type of Darknet) knows not to use java-script, For new users this can be a bit confusing, knowing what to turn off, what not to install, etc... to have anonymity on the internet. So the whole project really just targeted new users and other low hanging fruit (people they would have caught anyway or where already investigating)\n\nThe FBI is working as hard as it can to make this look good in the public eye because it was a huge fuckup, They caught virtually no one, None of the people they were actually looking for (they already had the original site owner), and actively participated in the abuse of children and the hosting and distribution of child pornography.

The audio cassette is now used to train and\u00a0desensitize\u00a0FBI agents as to the raw reality of torture and murder.\"\n\n\"Stephen Kay, the prosecutor at Bittaker's trial, still considers the murders committed by Bittaker and Norris as being the worst criminal case he has ever prosecuted or encountered...\u00a0In interviews, he has stated that for over two years following the trial of Lawrence Bittaker, his sleep was disturbed by recurring nightmares in which he would be rushing to Bittaker's van to prevent harm coming to the girls, but would \"always get there too late.\"\n\n\"Detective Paul Bynum, the chief investigator of the murders committed by Bittaker and Norris, committed suicide in December, 1987. He was 39 years old. In a ten-page suicide note, Bynum specifically referred to the murders committed by Bittaker and Norris as haunting him, and of his fear they may be released from prison.\"\n\nFrom the \"Silence of the Lambs\" trivia page: \"After working with John Douglas for some time, Scott Glenn thanked him and said how fascinating it was to have been allowed into his world. Douglas laughed and told Glenn that if he really wanted to get into his world, he should listen to an audio tape of serial killers Lawrence Bittaker and Roy Norris torturing, raping, and murdering two teenage girls. Glenn listened to less than one minute of the tape, and has since said that he feels he lost a sense of innocence in doing so, and that he has never been able to forget what he heard.\"",

Not time in prison until he dies. \n\nHe's just a kid. It doesn't make what he did any less horrible. But locking him away does no one any good. Treatment is the path to rehabilitation.

But it's nearly impossible different pictures will have the same barcode in both software because they are generated with different criteria. \n\nA picture of an apple and an apple tree might match in one because they both have a green apple in a round shape. But they won't match in the other because it's counting how much brown is in the pictures and the tree trunk is much more Brown than the apple stem. \n\nI know that's more eli15 but I hope that helps get the idea across and why you always use two signatures in digital forensics if you plan to have your analysis hold up in court.

(Basically the ability to just go \"yup, I'm done with videos/picture today\", and either do other work or even take the rest of the day off) \n\n - (outside of work) having a good support network with friends and family.

It's difficult to get in the mood with your partner when you're still picturing the abuse you witnessed that day.)\n\nHe also mentioned which common aspects of the movies were the most damaging to witness from an investigators perspective, it's definitely not a job I could do.",

It's an unpleasant experience for everyone involved.  A law enforcement officer with experience in investigating child exploitation crimes and/or digital forensics will often testify as an expert to confirm that a given image or series of images has a checksum equal to the checksum of known child pornography whose victims has been identified.  Most individuals charged with possession will have in their possession at least one image from a known series, so it's a fairly effective system.  In a possession-only case, it's uncommon to have (all or only) unknown victims (usually when all the victims are unknown, LEO becomes suspicious that it's a production case, and the victims are usually known personally by the defendant), so having to confirm that it is, in fact, child pornography is trivial.\n\nSome defendants will actually plead guilty once they learn that the CP will actually be shown in court, or that their victims will actually have to testify against them (e.g. if the victims are family members), in front of the defendant's own family and/or friends.",

He didn't seem to get phased by anything. \n\nOne day, I got the call to go down to the morgue to pick up some guy for cremation. Standard stuff. 99% of the time all I ever saw was a body bag and a death certificate. \n\nThis day, though, I walked in to the ME almost pushing the body into my hands. He told me that he couldn't stand to see it anymore and he needed it gone. \n\nThis was a young kid who had gotten drunk and committed suicide by train. Sometimes that meant blunt force trauma, in this case it meant there were about seven different parts to shuffle through.

He said the stench of the alcohol and the huge number of injuries he had to account for were giving him nightmares.

I remember reading some news about this last year where the vast majority of those arrested in the US were released because the FBI was unwilling to disclose the methods they used to breach the suspects anonymity. So as far as the courts were concerned, the FBI grabbed 300 random people and put them in a jail cell because the FBI was unwilling to explain exactly how they were able to get an IP address from the suspects computers.\n\nThey also set a dangerous precedent by doing this the way they did. To start, they used a single warrant to justify installing malware on over 8000 computers, most of which were not in US jurisdiction. This is basically a a blatant disregard of the 4th amendment for American's and I'm willing to guess that its not legal in the EU for a foreign government to surveil its citizens on behalf of their government. Their crimes aside, there are a few things that should probably scare people here. First, the government is willing to issue mass warrants for data stored on electronic devices with no particular target in mind. Basically, this is functionally no different than raiding the homes of every person who's number was stored on a drug dealers phone. Second, that people were convicted in their domestic courts using evidence collected under a foreign warrant without any judicial review besides a single American judge. I'll take this as a win, bad people were put away, I just hope that were not watching the \"slippery slope\" argument in action here. This exact method could be used to tract and arrest people planning a protest for example.",

It was inevitable, he said, you just needed to wait long enough. Eventually someone would crack and the riot would begin, and then he would have something to officially punish them for.\n\nThe warden knew that a riot would happen, so who is really responsible for the riot?  \n\nLet's say that inmate #743 was the first to crack and he started the riot this time.  \nIf that \"weakest\" inmate wasn't there (because he was dead/in solitary/at trial/etc) then they would just wait until the next weakest inmate cracks. Everyone has a breaking point, and the warden can manipulate all of the variables until someone breaks.\n\nCan you really blame the inmates for rioting if they are being manipulated and coerced into doing it?",

These federal certificates, if granted, protect the privacy of research study participants and can offer temporary exemptions from mandatory reporting laws. But there has been only one certificate granted in the area of pedophilia research. Between 1977 and 1985, Dr. Gene Abel interviewed 561 unidentified sex offenders in order to better understand this under-researched population. No one has been given one since.  \n\nBasically the US has the ability to grant immunity for research and treatment on this but refuses to do so. They're much more interested in criminal justice and punishing offenders than they do about treatment and preventing offenses in the first place. This almost mirrors the current drug policy and the \"war on drugs\" but more acutely. At least with drug addicts they have treatment and rehabilitation centers that provide some kind of support.  \n\nAfter reading this, I still have no sympathy for those that offend, but I'm saddened by those who have not, have this attraction, want help, but have no resources to obtain it.",
