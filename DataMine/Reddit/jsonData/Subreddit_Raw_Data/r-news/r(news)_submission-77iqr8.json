    "body": "Are you kidding me?  This fu**ing guy.  No other felon in the entire state of Arizona gets to EVER, I repeat EVER have their felonies expunged. It's the b.s. law in that state - doesn't matter if it's been 50 years and it was a non-violent, non-repetitive, lowest possible class of felony. According to the current law you will die with that on your record. \n\nThe best any felon in the state can ever hope for is to get their conviction \"set aside\", which means and changes literally nothing because your felony STILL shows up on your record and the listing might or might not actually mention it being \"set aside\". \n\nI ought to know, the same thing happened to me 20 years ago. I've clawed my way back from that and it was a nightmare to get there. I've had five official job offers rescinded (even though I was 100% honest about my conviction), I've been prevented from doing charity work ffs, I've even recently had an application for apartments rejected (they didn't care how long it had been or the nature of the offense). \n\nSo while most states clear your record in seven years, I get to live with this stigma my entire life because of where I lived when I was a stupid 18 year old kid who- brace yourselves this might shock you - made a bad choice. It doesn't matter that I've educated myself. It doesn't matter that I've never broken the law again. It doesn't matter that I served no jail time and got out of probation early.  It doesn't matter that I've actually slogged my way out of one job after another that knew I was overqualified and took advantage of my record, paying me nowhere near what others in my field routinely make because they knew I had few choices. None of that matters, my records WILL NEVER CHANGE. And you know what?  I made my bed, I should sleep in it. I learned from the experience, I've worked extremely hard to make up for it, and I'm stronger because of it. \n\nBut this WEASEL, this cringing loathsome, nausea inducing attention seeking lying cheating sack of excrement knowingly and willingly made the choice to break the law he pretends to uphold, gets away with it entirely, doesn't even have to deal with the nightmare of a prison system he spent YEARS making as demeaning and unpleasant as he could possibly make it (beyond anything even close to resembling a normal US prison), and he has the gall to try to weasel his way out of having a record?  Unbelievable. This man has learned nothing. He is a criminal and will never be anything else.\n\nI would say that I'm happy that he got denied, but that would require me to believe for one second that he won't find some other way to get it expunged. He can't just live with it like others have had to do their entire lives, no, that would mean he's just like every other citizen (read: peon) in this state. Why live with it when you know you can call in a favor, game the system, and come out smelling like roses?  This COWARD deserves to live with that stigma, but clearly he won't. What an utter disgraceful, pathetic, POS.\n\nEdit: Wow, thanks guys. Really appreciate the support and the gold! :)",

    "body": "This is a reddit meme that took off because this sheriff is objectively awful, but it's an incorrect statement of law. Here's an article on the matter:\n\nSome people have asked: Does accepting a presidential or gubernatorial pardon imply an admission of guilt? The answer turns out to be complicated.\n\n1. In 1915, the Supreme Court indeed said, of pardons, that \u201cacceptance\u201d carries \u201ca confession of\u201d guilt.\u00a0Burdick v. United States\u00a0(1915). Other courts have echoed that since.\n\n2. On the other hand, a pardon has historically been seen as serving several different functions, one of which is protecting people who were convicted even though they were legally innocent. In\u00a0the words of Justice Joseph Story, the most respected early commentator on the Constitution (writing in 1833),\n\n>*There are not only various gradations of guilt in the commission of the same crime, which are not susceptible of any previous enumeration and definition; but the proofs must, in many cases, be imperfect in their own nature, not only as to the actual commission of the offence, but also, as to the aggravating or mitigating circumstances. In many cases, convictions must be founded upon presumpions and probabilities.*\n\n>*Would it not be at once unjust and unreasonable to exclude all means of mitigating punishment, when subsequent inquiries should demonstrate, that the accusation was wholly unfounded, or the crime greatly diminished in point of atrocity and aggravation, from what the evidence at the trial seemed to establish? A power to pardon seems, indeed, indispensable under the most correct administration of the law by human tribunals; since, otherwise, men would sometimes fall a prey to the vindictiveness of accusers, the inaccuracy of testimony, and the fallibility of jurors and courts.*\n\nIndeed, some pardons expressly state that they are based on the pardoner\u2019s decision that the defendant was actually innocent; and some legal rules expressly contemplate that \u2014 consider, for instance, the\u00a0federal statute that provides for compensation of the unjustly convicted, which allows a plaintiff to prevail by showing (among other things) \u201cthat he has been pardoned upon the stated ground of innocence and unjust conviction.\u201d\n\n3) Another function of a pardon has historically been protecting people who were seen as legally guilty but morally innocent. Returning to Story,\n\nBesides; the law may be broken, and yet the offender be placed in such circumstances, that he will stand, in a great measure, and perhaps wholly, excused in moral and general justice, though not in the strictness of the law. What then is to be done? Is he to be acquitted against the law; or convicted, and to suffer punishment infinitely beyond his deserts?\n\nConviction followed by a pardon, Story argues, is a means of making sure the law is followed, but that \u201cmoral and general justice\u201d is nonetheless served.\n\n4) Of course, pardons have also been seen as having various other functions as well, such as decreasing the punishment of someone who is legally and morally guilty, for instance when \u201cthe situation and circumstances of the offender, though they alter not the essence of the offence, ought to make [a] distinction in the punishment\u201d (Story\u2019s words again). Sometimes the pardoning statement explains the pardoner\u2019s reasons for the pardon; sometimes it doesn\u2019t. And the beneficiaries of the pardon may of course disagree with the reasons given, even if they agree that a pardon is proper.\n\nLegal authorities, then, are split on the subject of how the law should understand pardons; but because some pardons are understood as being based on the pardoned person\u2019s factual innocence, I doubt that any judge today would genuinely view acceptance of pardon as always being an admission of guilt. And my sense (though I realize that it might be mistaken) is that most people\u2019s moral judgment today would be that, even if a pardon is offered just as a\u00a0gesture of mercy and not as exoneration, the recipient may honorably accept it even if they continue to deny their factual guilt or their\u00a0moral guilt.\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2017/08/26/is-accepting-a-pardon-an-admission-of-guilt/  ",

    "body": "Given that the sheriff's office has never undergone a nice, thorough audit, it is not out of the question that the funds from the vending machines at the jail have gone into *someone's* pocket. How *does* he afford all those [real estate investments?](http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/news/sheriff-joes-real-estate-game-6431878) From 2004:\n\n>Which is why I'm very interested in old man Joe's extensive real estate holdings. Especially after I discovered he's got $690,000 in cold, hard cash invested in two small commercial properties in Scottsdale and Fountain Hills.\n\n>The total amount of cash slippery Joe has stashed into at least six other real estate investments may be much more than this. How much more, I don't know. That's because the 72-year-old has taken unusual steps to make sure the public can't find out the amount of cash he's stashed into Maricopa County real estate.\n\n>Rather than disclosing details of his real estate investments -- as the rest of us who might dabble in dirt must do -- Arpaio got his records purged from the Maricopa County Recorder's Office. The redacted records include such key information as deeds, mortgages, affidavits of value and conveyances of title.\n\n>Everything needed to determine if a deal is done fair and square.\n\n>You know, like what's the sales price? Is there a mortgage? What are the terms? The county keeps such records for a reason: It's hoped that full disclosure will keep the marketplace honest.\n\n>All of these records are normally available for public inspection. But not Arpaio's.\n\n>And neither are the real estate records for his top deputy, the twice-bankrupt, double-dipping David Hendershott, paid a $131,189 salary plus another $51,000 in annual pension money (he retired from the sheriff's office and was rehired as chief deputy by Arpaio). Hendershott enjoys his evenings in an upscale neighborhood of $400,000 homes in Peoria. How much did Hendershott pay for his nice pad at 24232 North 80th Lane? Did he pay cash? Can't tell, because Hendershott's real estate records also are sealed.\n\n[Hendershott](https://images2.phoenixnewtimes.com/imager/u/blog/6650111/parade_of_fools_hendershott.jpg) was a fascinating character himself. He *eventually* [got fired](http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/news/joe-arpaio-fires-dave-hendershott-and-larry-black-sheriffs-key-aides-accused-of-crimes-and-misconduct-6641772) on corruption charges, but for years was Arpaio's Chief Deputy.\n\n>The termination of Hendershott ends his long, controversial, and financially prosperous career at the Sheriff's Office. After starting with the agency in 1978, Hendershott became a favorite of Arpaio's following the sheriff's election in 1992. From 1996 to 1999, Hendershott's salary doubled, from about $60,000 to $120,000. In 1999, Arpaio allowed Hendershott to quit, begin collecting a pension of $51,000 annually, then get rehired to his same position at the same $120,000 salary. The double-dip caused a firestorm back then, but such things have since become the norm.\n\n>Four years ago, Larry Black took a $386,000 one-time pension payment, retired, and was rehired as one of Arpaio's top aides. Deputies interviewed by the AG's office reported that Hendershott and Black made up Arpaio's \"inner, inner circle.\"\n\n>As Arpaio's right-hand man, Hendershott was behind some of the office's most diabolical stunts over the years, including the targeting of political enemies with half-baked criminal investigations. He claimed to have ordered the arrests of New Times executives Michael Lacey and Jim Larkin in a blatant attack on the newspaper, which has dogged him and the sheriff for years.\n\nI seem to recall he also got stuck once, joyriding in a vehicle that had been seized by his department. He was physically too large to get out by himself, and rescue had to be called to extricate him.",
