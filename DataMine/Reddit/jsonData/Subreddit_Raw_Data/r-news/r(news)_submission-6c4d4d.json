The reality is a rep sitting down with a doctor to go over new drug lines, testing, and etc., is actually just a really good way for the doctor to stay current on things as they come out.  No one is prescribing cancer medicine to an AIDs patient or whatever other things people imagine is happening because a sales rep dropped off wraps and pens.\n\n",

    "body": "If only we could do this at a national level...\n\nIt's only legal to advertise drugs direct to consumers in the United States and New Zealand. The insane costs of pharmaceuticals are due to the fact that medicare can't negotiate with Big Pharma because of a rider in the Medicare Part D bill. The system is not economically viable in a capitalist society unless the 4 basic economic attributes of a competitive market are in place: large number of buyers and sellers, a homogeneous product, perfect information, and no entry barriers.\n\n\nGovernment policies have assisted the healthcare industry in blocking each one of these. Medicare pricing allowed insurers to piggyback on government pricing, thus concentrating \"buyers\", and Obamacare has concentrated sellers through mergers. It is impossible to compare procedures, effectiveness or any information on costs, benefits or substitutes because insurers deliberately obscure it (antitrust exemption for insurers) and state and federal regulators are complicit to allowing cost shifting to avoid the state paying for the uninsured. Regulatory hurdles to paraprofessionals, walk in clinics and access to the prescription pad, are entry barriers.\n\n\nThe free market has not failed to work. It has been blocked at every point by industry, which is deeply embedded in government and health care policy, and every reform effort begins with meetings with the \"industry\", which has captured the government and legislatures. So the industry redivides the pie and moves the deck chairs. It is a parasite that feeds on the host but must not kill it, because then it too will die.",

Gift from pharma to my BIL. Sis told me to tuck in, they were free, a gift from pharma.\n\nSis's decadal birthday celebration was held at pharma's expense.\n\nI forget what all else, but it's a seemingly unending flow of goodies and trinkets from thinly veiled bribery to writing pads and expensive gimmicky pens.\n\nBIL goes on junkets around the country, talking about how wonderful Drug X is; gets put up in the best hotels, speaks for half an hour, goes home with an extra few thousand and a free trip. And he doesn't work in what is considered a particularly lucrative specialty, either.\n\nGoldacre's [Bad Pharma](https://www.amazon.com/Bad-Pharma-Companies-Mislead-Patients/dp/0865478007) is an excellent book on what pharma does to get what they want.",

The real issue is until the least ten years or so there was negligible pushback against the drug and device companies also running the seminars where doctors get official continuing education hours to learn about new drugs, devices, techniques, and epidemiological/sociological factors. And FDA adminstrators have been appointed politicians instead of honest scientists for a good chunk of the last thirty years, so trusting a drug because its approved isn't that reliable either. A new drug is extremely unlikely to hurt anyone, but it's not easy to tell whether it was approved because it's actually better than the current best practice for a condition or not.\n\n A physician who just wants to practice medicine and stay out of politics or research science had to go rather out of their way to find accredited education, journal articles, or regulatory information that didn't trace straight back to the drug company. It's not really doctors fault that drug and device companies have been aggressively eliminating and obfuscating the little independent research we get on recently released products. Clinicians are not researchers. They don't have the training or the time to spend hours per new doodad trying to figure out whether the system is lying to them about the need to start using it, if that information even exists at all.",

There are a few ways they could go about that. Some businesses would like that arrangement as they're currently paying more for insurance and would get to drop that, others would dislike it because they don't pay for insurance. \n\nThe biggest hit would be to the industry. Most people working in health insurance would lose their job before long. Claims processing would be handled completely differently. With lower reimbursement rates, lots of businesses would lose out, but others would thrive. That's the real reason it's avoided - it's very disruptive to change an industry that fundamentally, regardless of how well intentioned it is.\n\nBut California's economy is larger than every other nation that has single payer save 3. The state does have the GDP and the scale to do it. What's more, it has one of the best role models for pulling it off with Kaiser. If CA could do it, it would reap untold economic benefits over the long term. ",

While commercial speech and advertising are not wholly unprotected by the first amendment, that type of speech is not given the same level of deference as \"classic\" speech. The government can regulate advertising to some extent, because the government can regulate the transactions that are being advertised in the first place. Since congress can ban cigarette sales to minors, congress can also ban advertising techniques and formulas that are reasonably believed to have the purpose or effect of inducing those unlawful sales.
