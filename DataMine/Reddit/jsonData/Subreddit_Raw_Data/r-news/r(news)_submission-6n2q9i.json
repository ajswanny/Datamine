    "body": "Yeah, hysteria over a justified historical record:\n\nORIGINAL POST: https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/6mtgtp/z/dk466xe \n\nTo those who falsly claim net neutrality does nothing\u2014\n\n*(A history of net neutrality infringements from [freepress](https://www.freepress.net/blog/2017/04/25/net-neutrality-violations-brief-history).)*\n\n> **MADISON RIVER**:  In 2005, North Carolina ISP Madison River Communications [blocked the voice-over-internet protocol](http://news.cnet.com/Telco-agrees-to-stop-blocking-VoIP-calls/2100-7352_3-5598633.html) (VOIP) service Vonage. Vonage filed a complaint with the FCC after receiving a slew of customer complaints. The FCC stepped in to sanction Madison River and prevent further blocking, but it lacks the authority to stop this kind of abuse today.\n\n> **COMCAST**: In 2005, the nation\u2019s largest ISP, Comcast, began secretly [blocking peer-to-peer technologies](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2007/10/eff-tests-agree-ap-comcast-forging-packets-to-interfere) that its customers were using over its network. Users of services like BitTorrent and Gnutella were unable to connect to these services. 2007 investigations from the Associated Press, the Electronic Frontier Foundation and others confirmed that Comcast was indeed blocking or slowing file-sharing applications without disclosing this fact to its customers.\n\n> **TELUS**: In 2005, Canada\u2019s second-largest telecommunications company, Telus, [began blocking access to a server](http://netneutrality.koumbit.org/en/node/5) that hosted a website supporting a labor strike against the company. Researchers at Harvard and the University of Toronto found that this action resulted in Telus blocking an additional 766 unrelated sites.\n\n> **AT&T**: From 2007\u20132009, AT&T forced Apple to [block Skype](http://fortune.com/2009/04/03/group-asks-fcc-to-probe-iphone-skype-restrictions/) and other competing VOIP phone services on the iPhone. The wireless provider wanted to prevent iPhone users from using any application that would allow them to make calls on such \u201cover-the-top\u201d voice services. The Google Voice app received [similar treatment](http://www.cnet.com/news/apple-blocks-google-voice-app-for-iphone/) from carriers like AT&T when it came on the scene in 2009.\n\n> **WINDSTREAM**: In 2010, Windstream Communications, a DSL provider with more than 1 million customers at the time, copped to [hijacking user-search queries](http://www.savetheinternet.com/blog/10/04/05/phone-company-helps-make-case-net-neutrality) made using the Google toolbar within Firefox. Users who believed they had set the browser to the search engine of their choice were redirected to Windstream\u2019s own search portal and results.\n\n> **MetroPCS**: In 2011, MetroPCS, at the time one of the top-five U.S. wireless carriers, announced plans to [block streaming video](http://www.wired.com/2011/01/metropcs-net-neutrality-challenge/) over its 4G network from all sources except YouTube. MetroPCS then threw its weight behind Verizon\u2019s court challenge against the FCC\u2019s 2010 open internet ruling, hoping that rejection of the agency\u2019s authority would allow the company to continue its anti-consumer practices.\n\n> **PAXFIRE**: In 2011, the Electronic Frontier Foundation found that several small ISPs were [redirecting search queries](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2011/08/update-paxfire-and-search-redirection) via the vendor Paxfire. The ISPs identified in the initial Electronic Frontier Foundation report included Cavalier, Cogent, Frontier, Fuse, DirecPC, RCN and Wide Open West. Paxfire would intercept a person\u2019s search request at Bing and Yahoo and redirect it to another page. By skipping over the search service\u2019s results, the participating ISPs would collect referral fees for delivering users to select websites. \n\n> **AT&T, SPRINT and VERIZON**: From 2011\u20132013, AT&T, Sprint and Verizon [blocked Google Wallet](http://www.savetheinternet.com/blog/11/12/15/top-10-ways-carriers-tried-screw-us-2011), a mobile-payment system that competed with a similar service called Isis, which all three companies had a stake in developing.\n\n> **EUROPE**: A 2012 report from the [Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications](http://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=08b9a3f5-b753-4ecb-b6eb-5ca8d1f89358) found that violations of Net Neutrality affected at least one in five users in Europe. The report found that blocked or slowed connections to services like VOIP, peer-to-peer technologies, gaming applications and email were commonplace. \n\n> **VERIZON**: In 2012, the FCC [caught Verizon Wireless blocking people](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-tech/post/fcc-fines-verizon-125m-for-blocking-tethering-apps/2012/07/31/gJQAXjRLNX_blog.html) from using tethering applications on their phones. Verizon had asked Google to remove 11 free tethering applications from the Android marketplace. These applications allowed users to circumvent Verizon\u2019s $20 tethering fee and turn their smartphones into Wi-Fi hot spots. By blocking those applications, Verizon violated a Net Neutrality pledge it made to the FCC as a condition of the 2008 airwaves auction.\n\n> **AT&T**: In 2012, AT&T announced that it would [disable the FaceTime video-calling app](http://www.freepress.net/press-release/99480/att-blocking-iphones-facetime-app-would-harm-consumers-and-break-net-neutrality) on its customers\u2019 iPhones unless they subscribed to a more expensive text-and-voice plan. AT&T had one goal in mind: separating customers from more of their money by blocking alternatives to AT&T\u2019s own products. \n\n> **VERIZON**: During oral arguments in Verizon v. FCC in 2013, judges asked whether the phone giant would [favor some preferred services, content or sites](http://www.savetheinternet.com/blog/2013/09/18/verizons-plan-break-internet) over others if the court overruled the agency\u2019s existing open internet rules. Verizon counsel Helgi Walker had this to say: \u201cI\u2019m authorized to state from my client today that but for these rules we would be exploring those types of arrangements.\u201d Walker\u2019s admission might have gone unnoticed had she not repeated it on at least five separate occasions during arguments.

Doesn't even need to be gigabit because although I *can* saturate a gigabit connection if I want to, I probably wouldn't normally.\n\nI used to keep my entire game library on my disk instead of deleting games as I finished them - and bought more disks to make more room - as I didn't want to wait on them to re-download if I wanted to play them again, because it took forever.  I want to stream high-quality video, while uploading high quality video, while doing a number of other data-intensive things.  And hell, when I do something like get in to an epic, five or six hour brawl in Eve that winds up making the news, I'd love to put a raw copy of the video I took of that up online to look back on later, but I can't, because it's too big, and I have to delete it to save space, so I have to encode it down and lose some of the subtle details that are present and just have to deal with it.\n\nGranted, I realize this is an edge-case/power user case... but I can spend money and get better stuff to support that sort of use case pretty much everywhere else.  I can build a computer that can handle this sort of thing, but I can't give my internet provider more money to support what I want to do?  My premium service is basically they fuck me over less?  Seriously?\n\nAnd what's frustrating about it, too, is, nothing they can do will make me a cable subscriber, but they act like the internet is the only thing keeping me from cable.  I don't want cable.  I won't watch cable at a hotel, even if it's the only thing to watch and it's no extra cost.  It's too annoying, and there's rarely if ever anything interesting on - and on the rare occasions that there are, I've already found something else to take my interest so I don't care.  They've butchered TV to the point where people like me can't stand it, and we're just going to be pretty much disinterested in it.\n\nReally, the only thing that locking down the internet will do, if it makes it to the point where my home internet can't do what I want it to do... is to drive me away from paying them any money.  If I can't stream video or do anything bandwidth intensive, then seriously, what's the difference between their service and a wireless service that actually has some competition?  Price?  They keep jacking up the price, and as stated, I'm willing to pay a premium to get what I want.  And it's not like I'm rich (crunching the numbers, I pull like 33k a year).  I just don't put up with services that don't provide what I want.\n\nBut unfortunately that's where I see this is headed.  Because all they see is that cutting my options for internet will make me want to watch their trashy, ad-infested TV, and that's not at all what I'm interested in or use the internet for.  And all it's going to wind up doing in the long run is losing money from people like me, who will find alternative solutions to entertain ourselves while they scratch their heads wondering why people still aren't subscribing.",

The service is meant to be revenue neutral, but I imagine if bandwidth costs go down quicker than maintenance costs go up at some point it could make money. I can only imagine how much the network build-out cost. Two guys showed up in a van and I pointed where I wanted the modem. They ran a fiber optic cable from outside my house, through my garage and to the desired modem location. From there a short copper cable connects up to my fancy-pants 802.11ac wireless router. The service tested at 870 mb/s downstream and 950 mb/s upstream if I remember correctly. That's faster than my wi-fi network currently so I don't see those speeds on my most of my devices.",

Using it to regulate a cutting edge service is far from ideal. But any other alternative is worse. The FCC tried to keep the net neutral without Title 2 by passing some regulations that were pretty much written by ISPs and were so full of loopholes they were basically worthless; but even that was too onerous for Verizon and they sued over it and won, with the court pointing out that the only way to regulate the industry short of a new law from Congress would be by invoking Title 2. A new law from Congress would be just about 100% guaranteed to be a disaster because lawmakers are a) clueless about the issue, b) accepting a frankly silly amount of ~~bribes~~ campaign contributions from one or more ISPs, or c) both. I'd argue C is probably the most common. \n\n\nEdit: To be slightly more sympathetic to the other side, I'm sure it would be great for ISPs to experiment with new pricing strageties and teirs. But the problem is there is no competition, so you if one of them really started fucking everything up you couldn't leave and go somewhere else. And most people don't want crazy pricing strategies and below-the-line fees.
