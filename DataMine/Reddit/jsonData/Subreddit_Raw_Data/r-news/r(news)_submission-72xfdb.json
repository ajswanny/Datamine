Was this time last year I had one of my more entertaining flights when I sat next to an older retired Playboy bunny, she was with Hef back in the 70's and she had some interesting stories. She only had great things to say about him, and reminisced sadly at the end how his health and mental state was declining.\n\nAccording to her they had a reunion a year or two ago, and its tradition for all the Bunnies to wait downstairs and greet Hef when he would appear at the top of the spiral staircase with his big red robe and pipe. This last year, they were all waiting at the bottom and Hef appeared, looking confused and said \"Who the hell are you lot!?\" and they replied \"We're your Bunnies Hef!\" He looked confused a bit longer and shrugged and said \"Wow I must have done pretty well in life\"\n\n**edit**\nLike I said it this was according  to her, like hearing any story from a stranger on a flight, or anyone from the internet, you gotta take things with a grain of salt. Just thought it was interesting to share, I'll never know if it was true or not, but I know she did really enjoy her time at the mansion and being a bunny, that's for sure. ",

    "body": "So this brings up some maybe strangely fond memories for me.  My grandfather subscribed to playboy for decades.  When he was in his late 80's they upped the price quite a bit and he cancelled it.  Some poor woman called him to ask why he had cancelled, pointing out to him that the price may have gone up, but now he'd get a few videos included.  He told her that he was 80 something years old, had been getting the magazine for 40 years and at his age, he really did just read it for the articles and he didn't give a damn about any dirty videos.  She must have looked at his account and realized how old he was because she dropped the price back down to what he'd been paying.\n\nThen when i was in college, i'd come home to visit and before I left he'd call me over, slip me twenty bucks and some of those magazines in a bag telling me to bring them to my guy friends at school.  That may seem a little weird - giving porn to your granddaughter to give to her guy friends - but if you knew him you'd realize it was a good deed on his part - figuring my friends couldn't afford to buy their own.  Then again maybe he figured if they were busy with those they'd leave his granddaughter alone. LOL\n\n\nIn the last month of his life he was in a nursing home and showing signs of dementia.  I was going to visit him and wanted to bring him something but couldn't figure out what.  My uncle went into his attic and pulled out some old playboys from the 70's and gave them to me to bring to grandpa.  Some may think this is weird but i remember the smile on his face when he pulled them out of the bag.  He didn't know where he was or why he was there but those magazines he knew.  Was the last time I saw him alive and I'm glad that brought a smile to his face.  \n\nEDIT - since you are enjoying my memory of Grandpa - I should show you what a badass he was.  Here he is delivering milk in a flood in Lowell MA [My Grandpa - Gordon Cutler is the one standing](https://i.imgur.com/Da0nFVo.jpg)\n\nEDIT 2:  I appreciate and am overwhelmed by all the gildings. I'm so glad my grandfather has managed to touch so many people even this many years after his passing. If anyone else is thinking of gilding - thank you - but please don't.  Grandpa loved animals and helping those down on their luck so I'd much rather you spent your four dollars donating to a shelter for either people or animals down on their luck.  Or even just buy the coffee of the person behind you in line - tell them it's from Gordon Cutler the badass, Playboy loving milkman.",

    "body": "I remember meeting him at his mansion. Buddy of mine lived in an apartment in the San Fernando Valley and this old lady who lived next door used to ask my friend to buy her groceries. She'd pay him $100 just to get her a couple of items. What stuck out to me was that she'd hand him a money order to get the stuff. I have never even seen a money order, so I don't know how one can use it to buy groceries. Turns out, that lady was Bettie Page. Once a week, Hefner would have his driver pick her up so they could hang out at his mansion and watch movies and shit. One day, she invited my friend and I to go with her. Hefner seemed nice. The mansion was pretty empty, though. It wasn't like naked women were randomly walking around or anything. After about 45 minutes, he asked his driver to take me and my friend back to his apartment. My friend was a bit disappointed we couldn't stay longer. I was just happy to meet Hugh Hefner.\n\nOn another note, my buddy ended up having to tell Ms. Page that he couldn't get her groceries anymore. He got weirded out when she started to accuse him of stealing her money, but then acted like nothing happened the next day.",

    "body": "This will probably get lost in the remarks, but I am a 66 yr old woman and I remember the strangeness of the era of Hef and the Playboy phenomenon . At the time, I was a virulent feminist and the Playboy building was in Chicago where I lived. I saw Hef standing at his residence in Chicago at that time . He was a short guy, holding a martini in front of his Gold Coast home. I was always appalled back then , and if you were a woman back then you threw your anger at guys like Hefner and other men who you thought were misogynistic fellows. Well, I mellowed with time, and I think of all of the great articles and brilliant essays that Playboy printed, and my feelings towards Hef and his magazine became more comical and I left that stage of anger to recognize the magazine as a terrific mouthpiece for the civil rights movement at the time, and the forum for writers and artists to show their ideas. I.E., I stopped disliking Hefner and saw him as just a person who had grown up, as I had, in the repressed 1950s, when it was taboo to be so many things. His porn is mild and silly to me now, and I recognize, despite his weirdness for dressing women as rabbits, his contributions to the world of literary brilliance. He published things no one would publish at the time. Believe me, you had to live in the 50s to see how daring his magazine was...including the porn, which now merely looks to me like any catalogue for Victoria's Secret.  So, well, good journey to you , Hef. Thanks for the articles. Yep , I bought your magazine for the articles...for real...signed, Grandmother now and former angry little feminist. Now I just laugh at my former self and hope all your rabbit ladies had good pension plans. Salut!",

He's a person whose flaws are going to be held up side by side with his weaknesses.

If you know anything about Linda's story, she was horribly abused and forced into prostitution by her scum bag boyfriend. Deep Throat made millions and she made a few hundred dollars. Her boyfriend forced her to do a dog porno at gunpoint. And when they went to the mansion for a party after Deep Throat came out, her boyfriend told Hugh Hefner about how he could get a dog to have sex with her. I guess he was extremely eager and into it, so he brought them to a room where him and the boyfriend watched as they attempted to get the dog to have sex with Linda. At this point Linda had learned to scare the dog off in a subtle way, so that her boyfriend wouldn't beat her after. I don't know who provided the dog, but it was at the mansion and I doubt they brought a dog to his party. \ud83d\ude26\n\nThe other part that creeped me out about Hugh is that he wouldn't let the Holly, Kendra, and Bridget leave to see their families like ever. The families had to come there. I recall one of them saying they weren't allowed to leave for a family trip. And when they left the mansion they had to tell security where they were going and it was recorded. They also had curfews every day. I remember the girls had to do a trip to Vegas in one episode and I just remember them being really nervous about getting back on time. I think they were only gone for the day or 24 hours but they couldn't stay longer than that otherwise they would be kicked out or in trouble.  If any normal guy did this it would be considered abuse.",

Everyone knows Hugh as the old, robed dude that lives in a mansion with a bunch of models but he's somewhat of a personal hero of mine for his contributions to literature and civil rights. In Playboy's heyday they published *everybody* of note, as long as the story had something to say. The counter-culture of the 60s thrived due in part to Hugh's love of the truths we find in story.\n\nKerouac, Murakami, tons of the sci-fi greats like Atwood, Bradbury, and Asimov,  ALL published in Playboy. He even published my all-time favorite author, Kurt Vonnegut, which is why I have [a single vintage Playboy](https://www.antichay.com/pictures/medium/22318.jpg) on my bookshelf. There was a definite kernel of truth to the whole \"I read it for the articles!\" bit that people like to do.\n\n[Hugh also came out in support of gay rights all the way back in the 50s](https://www.advocate.com/news/daily-news/2009/08/28/hugh-hefner-gay-rights-pioneer), famously publishing the controversial short story [\"The Crooked Man\"](https://lostgayfiction.wordpress.com/2011/12/04/the-crooked-man-by-charles-beaumont/) by Charles Beaumont. For those that don't know, \"The Crooked Man\" takes place in a world where homosexuality is the norm and heterosexuals are oppressed. It naturally causes a media stir and when asked about it, Hugh simply replied \"If it was wrong to persecute heterosexuals in a homosexual society, then the reverse was wrong, too.\"\n\nHugh's best known for building a media empire out of tits but his contributions to the literary world, counter-culture, and civil rights movements has made him a legendary American icon, or at least he is to me.",

Younger readers didn't realize the fight that Hefner had gone through to develop prestige for a magazine with naked women and thought, when they first saw it, that the politics we're a little ham-handed. \n\nAt least, that's how it was for me. But as a teenager I still picked it up whenever there was a new Updike, or Palahniuk, or King story. \n\nEdit: thinking a little more about it - I got older and more pretentious and stopped reading those writers. But I never really questioned the quality of writing in Playboy the way I did other magazines, I think because I knew it was the only place a lot of men were getting any sort of literature. It was like Oprah's Book Club for men, but the sort of men who specifically don't spend their days talking about what they've read lately. ",

    "body": "My grandmother had been on a decline for the past year or two. She had the memory of a goldfish. I don't mean this in an offensive way; it's just how it was. My sister brought her a coffee and my grandmother thanked her. A couple minutes later, she noticed the coffee and was surprised by it. She thanked my dad. He told her that my sister brought it. So she thanked my sister. A couple minutes later, same thing all over again. \n\nMy uncle passed away in June. My dad did try to tell her once or twice but she just didn't react at all... at least, not outwardly. At that point, she stopped eating. She was admitted to the hospital. At one point, she said my uncle's name and then said something about him never really eating well or being in poor health. Something like that. So something did click on some level. She continued to decline. It was hard to see her begging to be brought home - not to her home where she lived for over 60 years... she wanted to go to where she lived as a teen. That was home to her. When we arrived for a visit, she also yelled at my dad for leaving her there without any clothes. She didn't understand why she was there, why she was in a hospital gown, and why she couldn't go home. The last time I saw her, she was begging for someone to help her. It was awful.\n\nFor me, I feel like one of the worst things about everything was her mental decline. My grandmother was always healthy, active, and liked to keep her mind sharp. She made a point of it. She was bright and witty. It was heartbreaking to see her in that condition. \n\nEDIT: Thank you for your kind words, everyone. My grandmother passed away in August after about a month in hospital. It was so hard to see her suffer. After seeing her that last time, it was somewhat easier to cope as she was finally at peace. She was a beautiful person inside and out. I will remember who she was throughout my life, not at the end. ",

The man even cooked for us even though at that time, he could no longer eat food himself. He did this all because we were friends with a woman he loved. He even put our band in a 6 page article in his magazine because of his love for our friend (we felt we were good, but not that good :)  \n  \nAnyway, my mom bought that mag (way over a decade ago), because she happened to be excite that her son was in a magazine. I think she thought it was going to be like Playboy... it was not. It was their raunchiest (for their standards) issue to date because the internet was making soft porn mags like Penthouse look like Readers Digest. And this one, although they had soft lenses and the artistic style you'd find in a Penthouse, was near Hustler raunchy. My mom cut out all the offensive pages and left just us and the other articles so that my little brother could read it.  \n  \nAnyway, I came to say that it seemed to me like the tameness of Playboy was the opposite of what was rumored to happen at the mansion. And - at least in the 2000's, well past the prime of the mag, the harder core of Penthouse was in contrast to the total tame residence that was Guccione's residence in NYC. It was a multi-story museum that housed lots and lots of fine art. There was even a golden colored piano that was said to be Judy Garland's.  Bob's big thing was conversation. He'd host a great Italian dinner and talk about world affairs. We were just a dumb band compared to who had over the years: scientists, doctors, leaders, etc.  The man was a deep thinker and I always wondered why he was lower key than Hef. ",

We'd hide our magazines, comics, a corncob pipe my friend stole from his dad, and other cool stuff that we found from this old (I mean real old, like 100 years) trash dump in the woods. One time my friend and I found an old musket pistol but this fucking kid Timothy ratted us out to his fucking parents and his dad went to the tree and took it out and found our cigarettes. It was an old rusted to shit black powder pistol, we couldn't have hurt anyone with it but *noooo* can't have cool things. So Timothy got rocks thrown at him any time he tried to come to the tree after that, and my grandfather went to his house and demanded that they return the pistol. \n \nSuch good memories.
