    "body": "In 2004 my mom was diagnosed with ALS. She fell down a few times and had some trouble walking, so that prompted her to go to the doctor. I remember my aunt calling me about it and told me to pray she has MS. My (now ex) wife was in the air force and we got a waiver to allow us to move to the closest AFB to her if a doctor sent a letter stating she had less than 2 years left. This was a good deal as we had our 1st child so we could see both our families and they would get to see our son.\nThe doctor sent the notice and we moved only 3 hours from home, instead of a 16 hour drive. I felt like this was mostly done just so the military would move us closer. \nAfter she was diagnosed she went from walking with a cane to a wheel chair pretty quickly it seemed. I helped her move into an assisted living facility where she would be independent but a nurse on staff at all times. Looking back I think she was only there for a month because the next time I came into town she was in a nursing home. \nI would visit her every time I came into town for a bit. Sometimes we would go out to eat, but mostly it was stopping by. She got to hold my son and know him a little. I remember she got to go to his 1st birthday. But each time I would visit or call I noticed she was getting a little worse. Some days she could talk well, just a little slow. Other days it was like the sloth from zootopia. \nI knew in the back of my head the 2 years wasn't just some paper the doc just signed off on to get me closer to my mom. It was a death sentence. In march of 2006 she was sounding stronger and doing good, but not really getting better. I didn't visit as much as I should have. April of 2006 I don't think we made it in at all that month. \nIn my mind I knew the call would come some day. I fantasized that I would snap my phone in half and throw it or that I would just break something in my despair. Instead I got the call to come home because she wasn't going to wake up. I called work and left. I didn't leave the hospital for a couple days. I sat by her side and watched as friends and family said goodbye. On the 2nd or 3rd day my high school friends stopped by and we ate applebees and had a couple of drinks. They said their goodbyes as well. I remember being slightly buzzed and watching to catch a predator in her room. \nI was woken up at 6am by a nurse saying that she had passed. It's hard to see your mom transform slowly but consistently into a shell. I am forever grateful to this man for his contribution to the disease that took my mom. I really hope we can cure it so no one has to be trapped in a body that no longer does what you want it to.",

    "body": "About a month or two before my grandmother passed away from the disease (I don't quite remember the timeline, this was in 2006), she gestured for me to come closer. Her teeth hadn't been brushed in weeks, they were caked in nutritional supplement drinks, she had lost so much weight and muscle mass, she looked like a skeleton. When I finally bent down closer to her face, she told me that she was going to get better and we would play Scrabble again soon. (We loved Scrabble.) I was 16 so I was hopeful that maybe it was true, but my dad said it wasn't.\n\nI had to help change her diaper more than once. I don't think any 16-year-old should have to see their grandparent's pubic hair, but I wanted to take care of her. \n\nShe maintained her sense of humor right up until the end. She and my dad (her son) always had a feisty relationship, and whenever my dad would tease her, she'd give him the finger--even when she was so sick she could barely move, she would use all of her effort to flip him off. A lot of the time, though, she was on a very high dose Ativan so she wouldn't internally freak out about her condition. (I don't know if she did anyway.) \n\nWhen she started to die though, she kind of lost her mind and she began to talk to her mother and father and other long-dead relatives. (This is relatively common among people who are about to die.) \n\nShe finally stopped breathing with my father, her other son, and her best friend in the room. It was a relief to finally know that she was at rest and not in any pain. They all left the room at some point for some reason and came back and her cat was curled up on between her legs. That's when they decided to call the mortuary to come take her away. I'm still not sure what happened to her ashes, but my dad still has her cat. He's like 17 now. \n\nAnyway. That's my experience of the end of ALS.",

I know everyone says that about their grandma but I actually mean it - she was a smart judge of character, endlessly loyal to her friends and family, and just a wonderful woman. \n\nI watched that shitty disease slowly rob us of her over the course of two years - half of which had doctors doing everything they could to find a diagnosis, since the early stages could've been so many things - and it is bar far one of the most horrible things I've ever had to see for the very reasons you say. There at the end she couldn't move but her eyes were still as sharp/alert as ever... I'm not exactly a super empathetic person and it was (and still is) torture to imagine what she went through. \n\nWe don't believe she had the hereditary type of ALS since nobody else in our extended lineage has it... even so, I've given my wife instructions to secretly kill me if I come down with it and get to where I can't move etc. She's a nurse so she could definitely make it happen.

He was healthy light drinker, active dude with no family history of ALS in his early 40's with a girlfriend. His girlfriend left him, medical bills piled up. He was eventually diagnosed with als. Sold his property, financial investments to keep up. In a year he was in a bed 24 hrs unable to move without help. He would cry asking me why him? I did not know what to say to him. He quickly succumbed to it in months. It erased him and everything he had as he had to sell everything. ALS is a fucked up disease. Worst part is that you end up dying from suffocation as your muscles become too weak to push your lungs up and down using your diaphragm.  It took like 2 and half years and he was gone. One time he asked me if I could take him to the Grand Canyon on his motorized wheelchair and let him drive it off the edge. Man.. fucked up. RIP",

There was substantial improvements compared to the people who received the placebo. Over the course of few months the improvements wore off. That's why in Phase 3 they will administer multiple stem cell dosages across several weeks rather than a single one time dosage; to see the actual long term effect. It may not be a cure, but it definitely is a major step forward to treating this crippling disease and improving living quality. There are several clinics in the US and Canada that will be conducting phase 3. If you know someone who suffers from ALS, it is a good opportunity for them to participate in the trials. May be life changing. Good to spread awareness; there is still hope.",

He is an entertainer, he helped generate hundreds of millions of dollars for his fights because that is how many people wanted to see him, and that is how much they were willing to pay to watch him fight and suffer permanent brain damage basically. So he made all of that money for his employers and the venue holders and all that, and then he takes his cut.\n\nAnd nobody is stopping you from trying to do the same. Nobody is stopping you from taking advantage of all the free education on the Internet. Nobody is stopping you from mastering any kind of programming language,  From studying math and science and engineering, nobody is stopping you from doing any of that shit in securing your own financial future with your own hands. Nobody is stopping you from doing whatever you really want to do to make good money. \n\nMayweather day it his way, and he worked his ass off, he paid his dues. Not only that, but he lives in the skin that most people, especially white people, would not choose to live in even if it meant that they would be a lot more rich.\n\nAnyway.... You can work just as hard as him and make the same sacrifices ad him and do it the same way he did, or you can go ahead and do it your way. The choice is yours. So don't blame Mayweather because you are poor or because somebody else is poor. All of you people keep claiming that you are a better person than him, that you are smarter than him, that you are this and that. Then shut the fuck up already, and use your potential to make your own money, and quit worrying about his money.\n\n**And to top it all off, he donated 100 times more to charity than you guys will ever try to do, collectively, in your lives.** Most people barely ever donate one dollar a year. So he actually DID contribute more to society than a 100 million typical americans do, put together. So take all of your stupid irrational spite, and shove it all the way up your asses. ",

Than add the weekly sparring sessions where the fighter is getting punched in the body and head were the risk of injury is extremely high.  Now take a regiment like that and add the fact that the majority of your career you won't get paid shit, amateur fighters get paid nothing so they often have 2 jobs doing some bullshit. Hey you just got a fight and need to make weight, guess what the week before the fight, you cant eat nothing and can't drink nothing, hope your liver doesn't give out.
