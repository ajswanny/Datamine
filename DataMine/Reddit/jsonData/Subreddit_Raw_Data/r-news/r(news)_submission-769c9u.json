    "body": "A letter to Lily\u2019s breeder, a post by Theresa Strader, founder of the National Mill Dog Rescue in Colorado.  A longer read, but it will really help you understand how awful puppy mills are on a different level than just shouting hate/protest. \n\nDear Martha,\nIt\u2019s been fifteen months since you and I first met. More than likely, you remember very little about me. After all, we met in your world, on your property in fact. Since that day, elements of your world have become a very big part of mine. For that, myself and many like-minded people are very thankful to you.\n\nIn February 2007, I received an email \u2013 \u201c50 Italian Greyhounds in need\u201d and with that, a phone number. Having had a lifetime affinity for the breed, I called the number to find out what the story was and how I might be able to help. I\u2019m certain you know where this letter is going now.\n\nYes, February 17, 2007, after 40+ years, your kennel would be going out of business. Time to retire and relax after four decades of mistreating dogs. Five hundred and sixty one dogs would head to the auction blocks that day, 49 were Italian Greyhounds. It was without question that I would help, though I must admit, I had no idea what I would come to learn through the process. Due to transportation issues, I realized that if I were to be of any use to these dogs, I would have to drive out to Lamar myself. So, on the 16th of February, my daughter and I headed to Missouri.\n\nUnderstand, I\u2019ve been involved in dog rescue essentially my entire life \u2013 fostering and placing homeless dogs, caring for sick or injured dogs, assisting overpopulated shelters, etc. I have always known about puppy mills and pet store puppies but have never shared my home with anything other than rescued animals. For the record, I AM NOT AN ANIMAL RIGHTS ACTIVIST. What I am is a person who believes in the right to humane treatment for all living things.\n\nMartha, what I witnessed on your property was far from humane. Hundreds of terrified ailing faces, imprisoned in their wire confines, some staring at me, but most too fearful to look into my eyes, so unsure of how to interpret human contact. That experience has caused me countless sleepless nights and to this very day, the sadness and the fear in their eyes haunts my very being.\n\nI am completely aware that you were operating well within USDA standards \u2013 what a despicable thought that is. I am also aware that in your circles, commercial breeding dogs are considered livestock. Dogs are not livestock, Martha. Thousands of years ago, man domesticated dogs to be our protectors, hunters, herders, guardians, but most of all, our companions.\n\nI came home with thirteen of your dogs \u2013 nine Italian Greyhounds, two Dachshunds and two Papillons. Not a single dog that I had cared for in over 25 years of rescue work came anywhere close to the physical and emotional damage that your dogs had suffered. As it related to rescuing dogs, the next several months would become the education of a lifetime for me.\n\nThe entire purpose of this letter though, is about just one of those dogs, the one who would find her forever home here with my family\u2026.. #251 \u2013 AKC registered \u201cReedgate\u2019s Swift Motion\u201d. Oh, the irony of her name \u2013 Swift Motion \u2013 an Italian Greyhound who was never able to run. Caging her for her entire life stripped her of ever having enough strength in her legs to experience the joy of running. A cruel reality for a breed built to run.\n\nIn our home, we cut the chain from her neck, replaced it with a soft collar and named her Lily. At the age of seven years and one month Lily had been set free.\n\nLily was one of several of your dogs that was missing her lower jaw. I wonder how you might explain why so many of your dogs were suffering from this condition. I wonder if you were ever concerned about their pain or perhaps about how they were able to eat enough to stay alive. I wonder how many died in your care from the results of this condition. I wonder if you even noticed. I\u2019m very certain you did notice one thing beyond the rotting faces though \u2013 their ability to produce puppies. That\u2019s what your business is all about \u2013 producing puppies, at any expense.\n\nLily became an absolute treasure in our home. Despite her many health issues and her extreme fear, in time, with lots of love and care, she found her courage and when she did, no one was immune to her love. Men, women and children brought to tears to hear her story and to have the untold pleasure of meeting her. Lily\u2019s life was no longer about what she could do for you but instead, how we could make it up to her in a warm and loving home.\n\nIt was agonizing for our family to watch her suffer through four surgeries to remove mammary tumors, to attempt to repair her decaying face and to spay her \u2014 removing the papery black, pus filled organ that was once her uterus. How selfish of you never to see her pain, just the dollars.\n\nDirectly because of your gross neglect, every meal Lily ate was a struggle. We tried so many foods and so many different ways to make it easier for her to eat. But in the end, she had to do it her way, the way she learned at your place, the way she kept herself alive for you \u2013 picking kibbles out of her bowl, a few at a time with her feet, spreading them around the floor, then rubbing the \u201cgood\u201d side of her face along the floor to catch a kibble on her tongue, then extending her neck upwards and swallowing it whole. Think about that, Martha. How would you like to eat just one meal that way?\n\nDo you remember sitting in my car when the auction was over? The guys were gathering up the dogs that I had \u201cwon\u201d. You said to me, \u201cI just love my Italian Greyhounds\u201d. Oh, the thoughts that went through my mind when those words came out of your mouth. You don\u2019t love any dogs, Martha. What you did was spend more than forty years of your God given life using dogs for your personal gain. No regard to their physical or mental well-being, just cashing in on their ability to reproduce. Think about the thousands of dogs that passed through your hands \u2013 you robbed every single one of them of the simple joys they so deserve. A good meal, a warm and comfortable place to sleep, medical attention, and most of all, a human companion to make their lives whole.\n\nLily learned so much in our home \u2013 about being a family member, being a dog, being worthy. I will always be bothered that she never learned how to run or really how to play. But she learned how to love and be loved and for that, there are no words. She changed our lives forever.\n\nLily died on May 13, 2008 at the age of eight \u2013 about half the life expectancy for an Italian Greyhound. Martha, she died as a direct result of the neglect she suffered for seven years in your care. How many others have suffered the same fate?\n\nThis industry has been hidden far too long. The word is out, the days are numbered. People like you will soon venture out into fields of honest work and leave the care of God\u2019s creatures to those of us who truly love them.",

All the breeders I've known wanted a brief interview and check with me to know that I can care for the dogs and can provide it a good home.\n\nResponsible breeders love their animals and don't just let them go to anyone. If anyone is crying on behalf of \"breeders\" that sell to pet stores, I'm sorry to say those were just puppy mills that should rightfully be shut down.\n\nEdit to add: So my friend got her dog from a breeder. Her dog ended up developing a thyroid condition. She contacted the breeder who instantly became concerned, grilled her on the symptoms and made a note that one of the puppies from that litter developed a thyroid condition. She then contacted all the people who bought from that litter to let them know and be on the lookout for that condition.\n\nThose are what responsible breeders are like. They actually care for the dogs, they're not just doing the bare minimum of keeping them healthy and alive enough to sell them off to mall pet stores for cash and forget about them.",

The problem with dogs is not a supply and demand issue, but an issue of availability. In terms of actual numbers, the demand for dogs from people who want them, is greater than the number of dogs available, the problem is that in a lot of places you can't find the right dog for your family in a shelter. Municipal shelters in many areas are filled with pit bulls and other large breed dogs which are fine for some, but not for everybody. If you want a specific breed, or often times even just something small in general, you have no choice but to go to a breeder to find one. Don't even get me started on \"rescues\".

I wish I were joking, but [there\u2019s literally a lobby that spends millions of dollars *every year* to rebrand pit bulls as ideal family pets](http://www.cbc.ca/fifth/episodes/2017-2018/pit-bulls-unleashed-should-they-be-banned) despite pretty robust evidence that they shouldn\u2019t. The pit bull lobby gets a lot of support from commercial dog breeder interests, as both groups benefit from the idea that there shouldn\u2019t be limits on what kinds of dogs you can keep nor how many nor in what conditions. Arizona\u2019s ban on banning puppy mill sales was about to be defeated until dog breeders and pit bull lobbyists conspired to insert language introducing a statewide ban on breed-specific legislation (laws that restrict or ban pit bulls). The Humane Society of the United States quietly withdrew its opposition, which otherwise would have killed the bill, because the executive director is also involved with pit bull lobbying. Let\u2019s never mind the fact that often a majority of dogs in shelters *are* pit bulls and that banning bans on puppy mills hurts pit bulls. Wherever these people spend most of their time, it isn\u2019t planet Earth.",

People get into a huff about the idea of dog breeders when \"you should just adopt\", but the fact is there are good reasons to adopt *as well as* good reasons to go to a breeder.\n\nIf you have a small kid, for instance, I'm totally fine with somebody saying they don't want to adopt. You want to ensure that a dog has a super low likelihood of freaking out and attacking your kid (or worse, infant), then knowing the parents of the dog is a really good indicator of that. And before people wade in here with \"my dog is adopted and is great with kids,\" I'm totally happy for those people, but there's no way in hell I'm risking it. It may turn out fine 9/10 times, but that doesn't mean there's no risk.\n\nAnd of course there's always some risk, it's an animal, but the fact is traits in dogs, including behavior, are largely genetic and knowing where the dog comes from is a big plus for some people.\n\nOn the flip side, how many people need that amount of specificity when selecting a dog? Not that many. So yes, most people should definitely consider adoption, it's way cheaper, and the dogs can be great companions, and if they have baggage you can usually work it out. Plus, even in the no-kill shelters, the dogs that don't get adopted usually have a shitty constrained life, so by all means adoption is great.",

Because of this, there are statistically more attacks from pit bulls.  I don't think simply limiting a breed is a very intelligent way of looking at the situation.  Based solely on my own experience having lived in a city with a ton of pit bulls (San Diego), in the instance of hundreds, I have never seen one aggressive dog.

(If you disagree with that, you're a disgusting human being). It's the same with dogs; you don't deserve to breed or own dogs if you neglect their emotional and physical needs and treat them like crap. I'm not saying dogs and kids are equivalent, but honestly, in this case the principle is the same. Anyone who doesn't show basic decency to a person or animal who depends on them deserves to have that dependent taken from them.\n\nEDIT: A dog can get sick without it being the breeder's fault. The dog can have a birth defect without it being the breeder's fault. That's not the issue. The issue is whether or not the breeder cares enough to put in the effort to give the dog proper medical care and a healthy environment. To continue the child analogy: A child can have a genetic illness. That doesn't mean the parents don't deserve to keep the child. The parents don't deserve the child if they fail to care for the child's basic needs or to provide the child an environment that prioritizes the child's quality of life.\n\nTL;DR - The issue is not whether or not the dogs have perfect genes. It's whether or not they're being treated ethically. ",

I own three pitbulls myself and I could see how with a bad owner they would be animal aggressive. I've socialized then and continually work with them but I could see the propensity early on. Obviously this is just an ancedote though.\n\nAs far as dog bites of humans a lot of it is like you said, shitty owners like pit bulls. But even then some of it has to do with people who get bitten call EVERY dog a pit bull. I work in insurance claims so I see a lot of dog bites. The large majority are not pit bulls. Of the ones that are actually reported as pit bulls probably about 10-20% aren't even pit bulls. I've seen people call french bulldogs pitbulls.. \n\nSo that being said, when a pit bull bites someone they do a LOT more damage. Like they fuck shit up. So I also think that is part of the reputation",

By doing this you end up with an excess supply of dogs and not enough people willing to adopt them and they end up euthanized or on the street.

That's a retarded way to judge someone. If they are putting in hard work to take care of the dogs, and find them good homes, they deserve to make a profit. It doesn't make them inhumane at all to say they suddenly arn't a good breeder for making money off it. Doing it right would take a large amount of time, monetary investment, and plain hard work.

I also have friends who have a lab/pit mix rescue who is incredibly sweet and well behaved (got her at 6 mo). \n\nI very much disagree that the only way to know what you are getting is to get a bred dog. Plenty of bad dogs come from breeders and mills due to how they are raised (I was bit by my friends cocker spaniel, and a friend was bitten by my babysitters German Shepard-- both purebred). There are also plenty of breed specific rescues if you want a particular breed and lots of puppies in shelters. \n\nI have a lot of friends and coworkers who spend thousands of dollars on dogs through breeders and I try not to judge them- it's their life and decision. But I do want to object to the notion that shelter dogs are inferior. In my experience, they have been extremely rewarding, and often times better behaved than their breeder counterparts. ",

Asking which vet they use so you can ask that vet what sort of reputation the breeder has is not being nosy. Its ensuring that they are caring for the dogs. Otherwise your just going on the breeders word. \n\nI do agree that POINTLESS tail docking is cruel ( I won't call it torture because torture means your trying to get them to do something). I think some tail docking serves a purpose though. Hunting breeds for example. And it can be done with no pain using anesthetics. \n\nJust going to add on that if you have a problem with hunting dogs I don't want to hear it. I bird and rabbit hunt all the time with my GSPs. They love doing it. I eat my game. If humans were not around they would be hunting all the same. (My GSPs tails are not docked however)",

He had a ranch with many dog cages and things looked cleaned. I was in Rottweiler heaven! My main concerned at the time was buying a dog without hip issues (since rotties tend to have hip issues). Fast forward years later, he has Hypothyroidism needs meds everyday otherwise he gains weight and gets lethargic. Last year he tore his ACL and are scared he has hip dysplasia afterall. When I originally bought him I though I wanted to breed him and have cute rotweiller puppies, but after all his health issues there's no way I would  breed him and have puppies with health issues and put a burden financially and emotionally on someone else. Leasson learned. :/\n\nSide note*** at first I hated his tail and wanted it docked. But it was too late to do so, and the vet said no. Looking back not only was it a selfish reason, but it was cruel. I am so thankful I didn't do it, I love his tail and this year I will dress him up as Pepe Le Pew (The Looney Tunes skunk! Haha).
