Proponents of net neutrality provided numerous examples of specific anti-consumer practices that ISPs could undertake without net neutrality like throttling traffic to competing streaming services, blocking content outright, charging companies money for fast lanes, etc.\n\nIf the instant net neutrality was repealed, ISPs did the exact opposite of what they promised, and did exactly what proponents of net neutrality warned against, then of course their legal argument falls flat on its face.\n\nSo no, in the short term, nothing is likely to change. When the legal battle starts, opponents of net neutrality are going to say \"See, look, everything is still fine, right? Net neutrality was never needed!\".\n\nWhat we're likely to see instead are very slow and very subtle changes that move more towards the anti-consumer behavior proponents of net neutrality warned about as time passes, and they'll try to do them all as invisibly as possible. As a consumer, there's not too many reasonable ways you can even check to see what your ISP is doing to your traffic, so they'll get very creative.",

People can hear all the evidence, agree with it, and still decide to stick with their party, and support their corrupt representatives that voted to repeal NN.\n\n**Edit** - Some people think I brought up Trump as an insult. I didn't. It's just the defining feature of these people that I know. I'm sure it's not universal. Also, my family members aren't stupid, I don't want to misrepresent them. They are intelligent people, some of them have had successful careers as engineers of all kinds.

Reporters work in the MEDIA. They are the medium through which people can tell their story. They're also lazy. If you wrote a newspaper article and contacted a news paper, there is a good chance they will publish all or part of your story.\n\nI'm not a good writer, but I could help you write a newspaper article about the subject. I bet some subreddits would help you craft something good. Then start emailing reporters and asking if they're interested in your story. You, as a veteran, probably have more clout here than most",

A lot of the time when a suit like this happens the court says that, \"while we look at this case, we are going to keep the old status quo in place while we come to a conclusion.\" So then the court process goes on and on until a decision is made and the old rules stay in place or the new rules go into effect.\n\nHowever, sometimes the court will let the new status quo go into effect while the case gets played out and then depending on the decision the old rules might come back or the new rules will stay.\n\n Most people expect the old status quo will stay in place while the courts make their decisions\n\nThats my underqualified understanding of the situation at least.",
