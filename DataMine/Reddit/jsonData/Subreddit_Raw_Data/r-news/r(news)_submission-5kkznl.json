I thrilled to the adventures of #princessleia in the @starwars movies, but from '77 to '84, I was in love with Carrie Fisher herself. My bedroom was filled with Carrie Fisher pictures from any movie she was ever in (including Polaroids I took off the TV when #thebluesbrothers hit cable). I was jealous of Paul Simon when he was dating Carrie Fisher and wouldn't listen to his music until they split up. I paid to see Carrie Fisher and #chevychase in Under the Rainbow nine times when it was in theaters (mostly because Carrie Fisher was in underwear in one scene). In childhood, I committed myself to Carrie Fisher without ever meeting her the way novice Nuns commit themselves to Christ without meeting Him. Decades later, I got to tell her this when Carrie Fisher and @jaymewes were in a station wagon on the set of #jayandsilentbobstrikeback. She was gracious about hearing it for the zillionth time from the zillionth man or woman who grew up idolizing her, but wickedly added \"I'm glad to know I helped you find your light saber.\" And with that, she stopped being Carrie Fisher to me and just became Carrie. That's the Carrie I'll always remember: the dutiful standard-bearer of childhood dreams with a the wicked sense of humor and a way with words. She didn't want to get paid for her role in @jayandsilentbob Strike Back; instead, she asked that we buy her these antique beaver chairs. Her reason: \"Beaver seems an appropriate currency for this movie.\" When she was a guest on Season 1 of our @hulu show #Spoilers, Carrie curled up in the throne like she belonged there. And she did: after all, she was royalty. As a boy, I dreamed of marrying Carrie Fisher. As a young filmmaker, I dreamed of casting Carrie Fisher. As an adult, I dreamed of being as sharp-witted and prepossessed as Carrie Fisher. And now that Carrie Fisher is gone, I'll dream of my friend Carrie - whose entire magnificent career I was lucky enough to witness, whose honesty made me a better person, and whose spirit - like The Force - will be with us always.

In regards to AEDs most people don't really know how to use them and even if they did they are only effective in specific cardiac arrhythmias (Ventricular Tachycardia and Ventricular Fibrillation) you can't just use them on anybody. The reality of the situation is that out of hospital (and really even in hospital) cardiac arrest is devastating and recovery even with the best medical management is poor.",

Then, the longer you live the the chances of getting this or that ailment increases just because you've been alive so long. Kind of like, drive a motorcycle a few times and your chance of wrecking is pretty small. Drive a motorcycle cycle everyday and your chance of wrecking goes way up. \n\nI wouldn't be surprised if everyone would get cancer eventually, if you lived long enough.\n\nEdit: This is based on nothing but something my doctor told me a few years back.

    "body": "CPR in even the best circumstances doesn't always lead to good outcomes. The body conserves a lot of oxygen, but when the heart isn't pumping, it isn't getting to the brain. This is the whole point of chest compressions, to ensure the brain gets oxygen and blood. \n     \nI'm not an expert on flight medicine, but I have seen many codes (cardiac/respiratory arrests) in the ICU. An average code in a hospital includes chest compressions, a good airway (usually ventilating the patient early on with a tube into their airway (if not already present) hooked up to a ventilator that gives oxygen and pressure to inflate the lungs), IV push drugs like epinephrine to kick start the heart if it has stopped (think that scene in Pulp Fiction), pressor drugs in IV drips like phenylephrine, dopamine, vasopressin, neosynephrine and epinephrine (used in both push/drip forms) to keep the blood pressure up, amioderone to knock it out of fatal arrythmias if the heart is beating inadequately and shocks for the same. Some other crap too, like sodium bicarb, but I don't feel like getting into acidosis after working all night.\n     \nI doubt a plane had  anything more than an AED (like a defibrillator for dummies) and somebody trained for CPR months ago, but may have never done it on a real person. I doubt they would have a whole code cart and somebody trained on intubation. I'd be really surprised if they even had access to Epi, which is central to coding a cardiac arrest patient. I'm sure they did chest compressions, of course, but as stated earlier, even in ideal conditions that is no guarantee of not suffering a hypoxic brain injury (brain doesn't get oxygen kinda like a brain-wide stroke, as opposed to localized). Doing chest compression is Hard Work and it will tire you out easily. We usually switch every three minutes, if memory serves, and I have felt it the next day. I'm not sure what to compare it to, but it's like kneading a 10 inch thick slab of dough, arms extended with enough force to dig in two inches deep, at 100 beats per minute for three minutes straight. We have a few respiratory therapists who are ripped and do some good chest compressions. I do alright, but I tire very easily. Imagine the stress of the situation, a famous person, you've never done CPR, etc. This does not make for ideal CPR. If it's one person you alternate 30 compressions with 2 breaths. The breaths are no joke either, as you have to pull the head back, extend the jaw, and hope they don't puke because they'll probably die (I mean, they probably will anyway, but more so) and you'll get puke in your mouth. I'm assuming a plane would have a bag mask though, so one would only have to make sure the mask and head were in proper position and squeeze a big football looking thing. If she was in V. Tach or V. fib (i.e. heart still beating, but too fast and/or crappy to really do anything important to keep humans alive for long), the AED could shock her, but they probably wouldn't have access to drugs to keep her blood pressure up (sick hearts that just had heart attacks don't pump so good) so that leads to hypoperfusion of the brain and other vital organs, which start to work less effectively and/or die. Organs needs enough blood pressure/oxygen to function, and below it they die. Heart = heart attack. Brain = stroke/anoxic brain injury. Livers and Kidneys are also susceptible, and can further lead an already brain dead person on a course toward dead dead. If her heart was stopped, then you're stuck doing compression the whole time unless you have access to Epi pushes to hopefully get her heart going. You may need a lot of them. Even if there were medical professionals, they presumably would have no access to her medical history, her current meds, etc. Don't have a heart attack on a plane.\n      \n\"Machines\" don't usually keep the heart pumping after heart attacks unless they're in surgery. Initially it's man power (CPR), external pacing from wires or defibrillator pads if possible, actual heart + some type of (semi)temporary device like a balloon pump, VAD, Impella, etc. (not for use in codes, more like waiting for surgery or transplant) and most commonly actual heart/paced heart/devices + IV drips to keep the blood pressure high enough to sustain organ life. In surgery or especially sick patients (usually kids) they can be placed on ECMO, a device that bypasses the heart and lungs and oxygenates and circulates the blood for the body. Patients cannot be left on this device for too long and the most common complications are neurological. In surgery, this allows doctors to freely work on the heart while the rest of the body is kept alive, cooled down, and sedated. At the end they hook the heart back up and shock it back to life. In scary codes, the doctors may reach into a patient's chest and perform cardiac massage, i.e. compressing the heart manually instead of chest compressions. Sorry, I got side tracked.\n     \nThe take away is that in ideal circumstances the outlook wouldn't be great. On a plane for half an hour away from critical care resources, you're looking at an even poorer prognosis for neurological recovery. Once a lot of brain is dead, that's just it. The liver and the kidneys can function on half steam to a certain extant, but once you start messing with the lizard brain you're basically dead. If you can't regulate your own body temperature or breathing, only the ICU is keeping you alive. Not a pretty picture. At that point, we can start to talk about fixing the heart, but the damage has already been done. What's the point?",

Because my classes (thankfully) attract the brooding, dark-color-wearing, tortured artist type, I have a lot of beloved students whom I know to be \"the best minds of [their] generation\" who smoke and have a fatalistic idea/rationalization about it.\n\nBut even though I am of the same ilk, I have never inhaled smoke from *anything* (even pot\u2014there are other ways, you know). I was the androgynous goth boy with the clove cigarettes in my 20s, but I didn't inhale (I love the taste of cloves, and I love the look\u2014but I probably only bought 4 packs in my life!). No real smoking, ever. \n\nMy grandmother, one of the sharpest people I've ever known, died a very slow, lingering death, watching her mind\u2014the thing she was most proud and confident of\u2014deteriorate along with her body. By the time she died, she hadn't smoked in almost 20 years, but the damage had been done, according to the doctors.\n\nJust don't start. Is that so hard? Not only is it a dirty, smelly, expensive habit, nicotine is one of the most addictive substances on Earth, and inhaling smoke is one of the most dangerous things you can do. Why bother having that first one?",

Sure, it's still 2-3x higher survival rate than doing nothing before the ambulance show up, but it's typically between 5-30~% likelihood of survival and it's pretty physically brutal on the patient.  In one Japanese study of 95,000 CPR cases, just eight percent of patients survived for longer than a month after being revived.\n\nIn the CPR courses I've taken in the past and recently, the instructors have joked around saying if you don't break a rib or two you're doing it wrong.  It's far from gentle and has a low rate of success when you consider the statistic.\n\nSurveys have shown if given a choice, most doctors would refuse CPR to be done to them even in life and death situations.  They know that survival does not mean you'll ever be the same again after the ordeal.  Like you said, CPR can only do so much.",
