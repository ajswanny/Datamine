And he demanded full-frontal nudity.\nHe had been constantly asking for more skin, for more sex. Once before, Julie Taymor got him to settle for a tango ending in a kiss instead of the lovemaking scene he wanted us to shoot between the character Tina Modotti, played by Ashley Judd, and Frida.\n\nBut this time, it was clear to me he would never let me finish this movie without him having his fantasy one way or another. There was no room for negotiation.\n\nI had to say yes. By now so many years of my life had gone into this film. We were about five weeks into shooting, and I had convinced so many talented people to participate. How could I let their magnificent work go to waste?\n\nI had asked for so many favors, I felt an immense pressure to deliver and a deep sense of gratitude for all those who did believe in me and followed me into this madness. So I agreed to do the senseless scene.\n\nI arrived on the set the day we were to shoot the scene that I believed would save the movie. And for the first and last time in my career, I had a nervous breakdown: My body began to shake uncontrollably, my breath was short and I began to cry and cry, unable to stop, as if I were throwing up tears.\n\nSince those around me had no knowledge of my history of Harvey, they were very surprised by my struggle that morning. It was not because I would be naked with another woman. It was because I would be naked with her for Harvey Weinstein. But I could not tell them then.\n\nMy mind understood that I had to do it, but my body wouldn\u2019t stop crying and convulsing. At that point, I started throwing up while a set frozen still waited to shoot. I had to take a tranquilizer, which eventually stopped the crying but made the vomiting worse. As you can imagine, this was not sexy, but it was the only way I could get through the scene.\"\n\n\n\nJesus, what a piece of human filth.",

The production staff had to have known, the actress says. Seems like actors are almost expected to sleep their way to the top. Even Joey on *Friends* said \"can't I just sleep with a producer to get the role?\".\n\nI also kind of feel like a lot of industries have their dirty open secrets. In Hong Kong for example the construction industry is exceedingly corrupt. Entertainment here has triad ties and female talent is often expected to sleep their way into fame. The USA gymnastics world has plenty of molesters.

This is the reason no one spoke up before, it was just expected that this is how things work, and it would be pointless to risk your career over it. This kind of abuse is prominent everywhere, and we have recently seen Politicians, restaurateurs, and even Bill O'Reilly brought down by these charges. Hollywood opened the floodgates to allow people who are sexually abused (who are disproportionately women due to the fact most high level execs are straight men) to come forward and be listened to. And while we should be watchful for fake allegations, it is important to remember that small amount of fake allegations that redditors (and the country) was so hung up is what has allowed people like Weinstein to act unimpeded for so long.",

Ed is an incredible actor, but reportedly difficult to work with. I can see him totally being the type of guy who would agree to an interesting role of it helped save a friend's production in real life, and I can buy the idea of him being the type of guy who would want to rewrite ANY script given to him. Maybe being asked to rewrite the script was something he was eager to do anyways after reading it and seeing things he wanted changed. Despicable that he wasn't given credit for it, but it's still a really cool credit to his talents and work ethic. ",

Remember, this isn't the porn industry. While some might enjoy filming sex scenes, I doubt the majority of them actually do. They had to do it because they don't want to end their own career. As a result, they're easily subjected to a lot of sexual abuse and manipulation. But hey, there are so many people who don't give a shit. Every time this topic is brought up, there is always that asshole that whines about \"censorship\". Those people always talk about how sex is treated as a \"taboo\" in America because people don't fucking like useless and worthless sex scenes that don't add anything to the show/movie. No, sex is not a taboo. In fact, there is too much sex in American media. If people wanted to watch sex scenes, they can watch porn. Why force actors/actresses to do a sex scene that won't show the sex fully anyway? Why? If you're horny and desperate, wouldn't you watch porn? Why would you want to watch a half-assed sex scene that doesn't even show the genitals in a very public show/movie? What benefit is there to that? Fuck those apathetic assholes that whine about \"censorship\" everyday while ignoring the sacrifices people had to make to satisfy their lust. Keep it private and watch porn instead. Stop trying to push for more sex scenes in movies and TV shows for no reason.",

For example, he said that it's better for a sovereign to be feared rather than loved. In Christian Europe it was totally expected for rulers to behave in this way but it was unprecedented to openly advocate it in writing. His ideas are very important in political theory. \n\nIt's often asserted that he intended The Prince as a satire, as he was a known republican who advocated citizen militias over mercenary forces, and he was imprisoned and tortured by the Medicis. Personally I don't think it was a satire, but rather a breakthrough in realist political thinking that was basically Hobbesianism a century before Hobbes. But the term Machiavellianism comes from the traits he calls on Princes to display in *The Prince*, rather than from the traits displayed by Machiavelli himself. ",

Hell, even that emotional breakdown turned out that she had been drugged and raped by two guys at a party, but to him she was being too clingy and emotional, and he fucking knew that's what had happened.\n\nHe was my best friend and somehow I didn't see this side of him before. Dropped him immediately. It's been 6 years, haven't spoken to him since.\n\nI'm a lonely person now, he was one of the last friends I had in my life, but I'll take loneliness over propping up a piece of shit like that.",

    "body": "I\u2019m a guy so here.  It\u2019s easy to point the finger at Pitt and other men for not taking matters into their own hands and confronting this beast but how many of us have do so in our own lives?  I have stood up to asshats that have said things to my wife in public.  I have also played the \u201ckill you with my eyes\u201d game at times, but does any of that change behavior?  Have I spoke out every time I have heard guys play the \u201cI\u2019d do her\u201d game?  Or objected as guys around me assigned scores to women I knew? Worked with?  Called friend?  The answer is no, I have not.  I have failed to act is the way I know will best combat this culture.   The only way it will change is by guys changing it.  Peer pressure, a refusal to accept the status quo of male cultural acceptance when women are objectified, casually violated, relegated to second class.   I\u2019m ashamed  that I have not stood up more often.  I have to change, we all have to change.  This is not a battle that the women in our lives should have to fight.  They have the right to feel safe, to not be on guard constantly, never knowing when a guy is going to cross the line.\n\nI teach high school.   I took a group of students to present to the local rotary yesterday.  Two boys and two girls.  Amazing kids.   They were perfect.   They impressed the hell out of the local business leaders.  We we were standing outside the room after the meeting broke up two older guys stopped to talk to the kids.  I was to fare away to hear what was said and it was only as we left that one of the girls sighed and said \u201cwell I almost made it through the meeting.\u201d   I asked her what she meant and she said \u201cI almost made it through without someone saying something creepy to me.\u201d   Then she told me that the guys had commented on the fact that they would have been involved in the same type of activity the kids had presented about of their had been good looking girls like her in their school.  These guys were in their 60\u2019s at least.   The boys had not said anything because they were so shocked by it.  The two girls didn\u2019t because they didn\u2019t wan to cause trouble.  By the time I found out we were already outside and I still have not said anything to the rotary people.   That fact makes me deeply sad.   Why does this wonderful young women have to deal with this kind of treatment?   \n\nI\u2019m planing on talking to my rotary contact about this as soon as I see him again.  That will not change the fact that it happened, nor will it keep it from happening again.    The only thing that would have helped would have been intervention when it happened.   The kids and I talked about options and possible responses if it were to happen again but the truth is it will happen again to this young women.   Over and over for years.  ",

You're a nerd Kevin Smith, how do you deal with with people giving you shit?\u201d*\n\nIt was fucking funny because he mocked insult to being called a nerd, and then threatened to kill me. All in good jest. I told him that he had 2 to 5 years if he wanted to try or cancer would beat him.\n\nHe gave such a genuine answer and response. He essentially said \"make your voice be heard\".\n\nSince then I've been on TV (a show called You Can't Ask That) and Ive been a panelist at a festival. I have had people talk to me about their stressors (be it cancer or anxiety) and not to toot my own horn but I think it's helped.\n\nPoint is, I think Kevin Smith's genuine answer has helped me to help others. I really doubt he knew about the horrors. It's not his personality. The guy seems genuinely nice.",
