    "body": "That's one of the main factors that made me buy a house in Chattanooga rather than north Georgia where my wife works. It really is awesome. I gladly hand epb my money every month for cable and internet. I even kept gigabit internet when I didn't need it. I hate when people argue that no one needs that speed so there's no point offering it. For anyone at epb reading this: thank you, we love you. Stay awesome.\n\n**ETA: Also, the way you phrase it is not the way I understand that it happened. The power company here was known as Electric Power Board, now known as EPB. In order to build a smart grid for the power system they had to install a massive network. By the end of it, it was robust enough to offer as a service to customers since it already ran to every home and business. Well, comcast sued (big shock). They argued that it was unfair for them to compete against a taxpayer funded utility. As I've read, comcast backed down because EPB would've increased what comcast had to pay to operate on their poles. While that was nice for us in Chattanooga, it cost the rest of the state by comcast lobbying for legislation to prevent that from happening again in TN. At least, now a power company can only offer internet service where it also offers power. That being said, it seems this is the only way other cities can do it. The only entity with the resources to offer internet is going to be the power company. It's also the only company that comcast is dependent on to offer their own service. No power, no comcast. \n\n**ETA 2: Since this seems to be getting lots of traction, I'll note one more major point. While the shitty ISPs argue they don't offer faster speeds because there is no demand...EPB spends it's time from the \"if you build it they will come\" attitude by offering 10 Gb/s up/down to every home and business in the 600 sq. mile area. Also, I have no affiliation with EPB other than being a happy customer.\n\n[Welcome to the future](https://epb.com/home-store/internet/nextnet)\n\n**ETA 3: Oh boy, one of the biggest points of the night too...customer service. When you have an issue and need service (that's rare) you call and you are talking to someone in an office located downtown. Seriously, its on 10th street/ MLK blvd. Not some other city, not some other state, not some other country. \n",

    "body": "> net neutrality has nothing to do with that, right?\n\nI work for a non-monopoly ISP in the US, it does, and does not.  There's a lot of shady other shit that goes along with the repealing of net neutrality but the root cause of all of this was of course the rise of video streaming.\n\nELI5:  Pre-Netflix most people just used internet for surfing, with the occasional large download and a bit of music streaming.  ISP networks were originally designed to work kinda like how a bank does with savings and loans, everyone is drawing from the same pool to make their withdrawls, but the bank doesn't expect everyone to come and withdraw all of their money at the same time.  Because people typically only used a small percentage of their bandwidth ISPs didn't install the hardware to support a dedicated connection for everyone because it's a waste of resources and drives up customer costs (the company never pays, remember!).\n\nThen along comes Netflix and all the other streaming services and overnight (in telecom terms) everyone was maxing out their connections.  Paradigm shift is an apt term for it. Since everyone shares a backbone, everyone slows down.  Now the company has a choice, suffer customer backlash over poor service, or fork over a ton of money to upgrade the back end network.  The company raises prices to pay for the upgrades, customers bitch, but now HD is the new standard for streaming, so guess what, now people don't just want their whole 5 meg connection all the time, they want 10, 20 or more!  More upgrades, more price increases, more customer ire.  Now it's 4k and we start all over again.  It's a little simpler/cheaper for the bigger guys to upgrade because their fiber networks are overbuilt and they just have to upgrade the switching at their COs.  The problem is a bit more serious for us little guys that use non-copper means of last mile transmission.  We have to upgrade everything constantly, and it's almost crippling at this point. \n\nIf you remember at one point the big telcos took netflix to court, and part of their goal was to get netflix to pay for a portion of the service/upgrades because they were disproportionately creating the cogestion.  Didn't happen (cause they found a way to screw the end user together!).  Now they're going after Net Neutrality regulations that prevent them from charging extra to their customers for whatever type of content so they can stop some of the losses on the back end.  The company never pays.\n\nBe clear, I am in no way in support of repealing net neutrality and I wouldn't work for a company that was.  But as with everything in life nothing is entirely black and white.  I am also an Xfinity customer so I hate it as much as anyone else.\n\n\n\nEdit:  I guess I need an edit because Reddit.  I'm not attempting to justify the actions of the telco industry either in regards to net neutrality or use of government subsidies.  This is a bit of an internet cold war that has been going on for a while, with both sides (streaming services vs Telcoms) escalating it out of proportion.  But that doesn't mean that there aren't real world reasons why this war started in the first place.  Also keep in mind not everyone is a monopoly ISP, there are shocking amounts of this country, even very wealthy areas (just over 50% broadband penetration in the US) that major monopolies will NOT cover because it is too expensive due to population density or mountains.  Not all of us get huge government kickbacks for upgrades.  ",

Well, I did my research, that same plan was advertised as $35 for major cities and $45 for everywhere else. Fought some more, got my bill down to $50/month. That was the absolute lowest they would go. Mind you, I live in the midwest in a rural town with the only ISP being TWC for my entire town. Got off the phone feeling pretty good.\n\nMonth later, saw my bill was $55/month (+fees) and not the $50 we agreed to. They refused to change it to the 50 we agreed on and after 2 hours on the phone I said fuck it....still getting way better net speeds for nearly half the price...still don't have internet caps or anything 'yet'.

Due to the significant complexities in designing such a network, the state's issues are not unfounded*. However instead of banning muni-fiber, the state should be providing support in the form of technical skill for cities that wish to build their own. Most cities are not like chattenooga in that they do not own a utility company with significant expertise in infrastructure and this inexperience is where most of the risk is. \n\n\\* And before there is a post about \"there hasn't been muni-fiber issues\", Utopia in Utah spent a half billion dollars to gain 11K subscribes (at a cost of $45K per sub).

    "body": "At work and only had time to skim what you posted, but he bases most of what is in that article on transit pricing while acknowledging that last mile service is almost impossible to extrapolate operating costs but then says 'but it is likely similar' with no supporting evidence.  Transport is an entirely different beast than last mile and I acknowledged it in my post, albeit not as clearly as I thought.\n\n3rd level transport providers majorly overbuilt their fiber networks because laying fiber is very very expensive, their upgrade costs are cheaper.  Big monopoly companies now a days are both transport and last mile providers.   \n\nThink of it like a tree, the trunk is transport, if you want to upgrade transport you swap the switches at the ground and where it begins to branch and you're done, theyre expensive, but there's only 2.  Now the branches are last mile, every time a branch forks you need to upgrade the switch/router there, and the supporting equipment, then you have to upgrade the downstream branching points so they can support the new bandwidth, then once you have all of those done, you have to go and upgrade all the leaves (subscriber units) so that they can access the new speeds.  And that's all figuring that you're comcast or C/L and inherited an existing copper network, cause otherwise you have to cut off all the branches too and replace them.",

Our rates shot up $45 per month for the exact same service we've had for the past 2 years. The funny thing is that we've been able to get back on the promo rates for about 5 years in a row now by just threatening to switch ISPs, but this is the first time since the Spectrum/Charter/TWC merger and they basically flat out told us to switch to FiOS. No clue if that was a bluff, but we switched as soon as we could get a tech out here and we dropped off Spectrum's rental equipment in a FiOS tote. \n\nIt's amazing (mind boggling) how they're willing to lose a 5 year customer because we refused to pay an increase of $45 per month on top of an already expensive bill for the same service we've had. I really hope more people talk with their wallets (assuming they are fortunate enough to have more than one ISP option). For reference, we're paying $20 LESS per month now for 940mbps versus 100mbps. Two DVRs instead of one. HBO and Showtime instead of just HBO.",

On a rented sign trailer that they'd parked on the entry road was something like \"For Internet Call <some phone number>\".  They put microwave antennas on their customer's roofs. IIRC, one said they need line of sight, but it was a mesh, so customers only needed line of sight to another customer. It was around 1999, so we're talking kbps, but was better than DSL. And since it allowed me to work from home, I gladly paid them $100 a month. Plus, paying someone who you want to help succeed is so much better than paying TWC. ",
