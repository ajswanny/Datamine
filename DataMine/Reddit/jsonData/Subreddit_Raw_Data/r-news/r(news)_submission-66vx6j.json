I've worked as a university research mentor/researcher for a while and peer reviews have become an costly format and spelling check. You send out your study to professors and doctors on your subject all over the country and none of them really go through your experiment other than to assure themselves that they won't immediately look like an idiot if someone looks at the research. People who peer review want to get their names on as many papers as possible but the whole \"recreate the experiment\" part never happens. This has lead to the massive amounts of papers that are pretty much bullshit. \n\nFor instance, a semi recently study found that the results from 200 out 300 phycology papers studied couldn't be recreated, meaning that the people who wrote them just wanted to publish/push a narrative.\n\nI'm not anti science, although many of you will try to say that I am. I am anti subjective science and pro actual science. In the push to publish thousands of papers a year, academia has sacrificed it's mission. This can be seen in that Bill Nye is the current figure head of the scientific community. He isn't really a scientist, he's an \"engineer with a lab coat and a bow tie.\"\n\nTLDR; we need to reevaluate what we are pushing as science. It is currently acceptable to push any shit that will get you funds. And we need to enforce the actual system of checks. \n\nEdit: this and all responses are typed on a tablet and I also just suck at speeching so I'm sorry if I don't write no good.",

I had a professor coach me once on how to sell your\u200b grant proposal to \"people who don't have the facilities to understand actual science\".  \n\nFWIW though in many fields bad science does get caught, especially if it's a large field.  For example, that researcher at RIKEN was caught and her carrier ended when somebody else doing stem cell research realized they'd seen the same images before.  Likewise if somebody were to claim to have entangled 50 quibits or found a particle with negative mass or something, it would get checked very fast because many people are working on these topics. The latter was actually claimed not too long ago...\n\nPsychology is probably problematic because you don't have the same redundancy or got feeling that something needs to be double checked.  \n\nI do agree that the peer review process is only marginally useful having observed it myself, but it's worth noting that many journals have scientists do annual reviews of research in a given field what tend to hello identify common conclusions.  \n",

Because people who conduct peer review are not responsible for attempting to replicate the research. \n\nOtherwise, while it's nice to replicate your own study, it's also arguably better for other people to replicate it. Unfortunately, there's a bit of a publication bias against replications, and against null results, which means replications that fail are highly unlikely to get published (not to mention funded in the first place).\n\n>For instance, a semi recently study found that the results from 200 out 300 phycology papers studied couldn't be recreated, meaning that the *people who wrote them just wanted to publish/push a narrative.*\n\nThat's quite the inference you're making, and it also suggests fraud. Fraud is generally rare (e.g., Fanelli 2009) although individual cases do reverberate quite widely. More likely reasons for failure to replicate are related to sampling, honest mistakes, well-intentioned but poor analytical choices, etc. Rather than \"pushing a narrative\", people do want to get published, which can make certain analytical choices more attractive (e.g., choosing a test that crosses into statistical significance). These fall under questionable research practices (QRPs), and unfortunately publication practices tend to reward QRPs that end up being Type I errors.\n\nIn sum, what you attribute to \"subjective science\" or \"pushing a narrative\" is likely less sinister and related to incentives. Interestingly, the incentives issue is looking to get worse before it gets better in the US, as the current administration as well as state governments are looking to make more higher ed and research cuts in some areas, making competition for external grants more critical.

Money management is a huge part of our government and the added tax revenue from marijuana and lower cost on the drug wars for decriminalizing it is a big reason to make it legal. You just want that money going into our social programs and cities, not into a corrupt officials pocket. \n\nEdit: I didn't mean to inject weed legalization into the thread as much as I did. The marijuana thing is just a point I'm making to show that money is always going to be a huge factor in politics, I understand there are other reasons to be for or against it. Regardless of if you want it legal or not, there's no denying the drug war is extremely costly and that taxing marijuana sales would bring in a great deal of revenue with basically no negative consequences.

    "body": "I don't see how it could be dystopian, though. As is often said, science is a method, not a doctrine. It's not like religion. Suppose a religion says that homosexuality is wrong. Not to beat around the bush, I have Christianity in mind here. Now, times change, and people can come to believe that there's nothing wrong with it, but the Bible doesn't change. Nor do we get a new Bible. So, people who originally interpreted the Bible to say being gay is wrong have to either re-interpret it, or simply be ignored by other people who don't believe that and want to remain Christian.\n\nScience isn't like that. Scientific evidence right now says that there are no severe consequences for children raised under gay parents vs. straight parents, nor are there any major psychological deficits to being gay beyond the shame that people are made to feel by those around them. Supposing this is wrong, *the exact same method* used to study homosexuality before could be used to study it again and find that. Science does not rely on any text that must remain immutable; in fact, whole theories have been tossed out and replaced with better ones over time.\n\nMy point here isn't to bash on religion, but to say that people want the separation of church and state because they don't want a whole government that starts and ends with the interpretation of a single book that can never change. People don't call for a separation of science and state because *there is no holy book of science* which must always be reinterpreted and never revised or added to.\n\nAs a final note, if you're thinking maybe of the sciences that have historically proven to be harmful, like say, phrenology or eugenics, those were always pseudo-sciences that were eventually tossed out by the practices of actual science. Rigorous, ethically-practiced science simply can't create its own dystopia. Would it create a utopia? Who knows. It just can't actually create a dystopia. It's just a method.\n\n**tl;dr** Science is literally just a method used to know things, so I don't see how, when properly used, it could create anything resembling a dystopia.",

For instance, [glyphosate is about 186 times less toxic than copper sulfate--about the most commonly used certified organic pesticide--and is also sprayed around 1/6 of the rate of copper sulfate.](https://www.geneticliteracyproject.org/2016/05/09/popular-organic-pesticide-copper-sulfate-compare-synthetic-ones-like-glyphosate/) \n\nOrganic agriculture shuns GMOs for no reason, which causes them to use more pesticide. Here are a few examples: \n\n[GMOs increase yields by at least 24% in India, while reducing insecticide use by 55%](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305750X10001737).\n\n[Another study found that GMOs increase yields and reduce herbicide use by 40% in developing countries.](http://www.plantphysiol.org/content/124/3/923.full)\n\n[A study of Chinese farms found GMOs reduce pesticide spraying, improving the farmers' health.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?cmd=Search&doptcmdl=Citation&defaultField=Title%20Word&term=Pray%5Bauthor%5D%20AND%20Five%20years%20of%20Bt%20cotton%20in%20China%20-%20the%20benefits%20continue)\n\nInstead of using GMOs (which manipulate a single, heavily studied gene), the organic industry is heavily reliant on mutation breeding in which a crops entire genome is randomly mutated by chemical and/or radioactive mutagens, blindly impacting tens of thousands of genes. These thousands of mutagenically bred plants aren't required to be tested for safety. \n\n>Organic farming is ultimately about treating farms like an ecosystem rather than a factory\n\nThis means more food is produced on less land, which increases CO2 emissions:\n\nhttp://www.cnn.com/2012/04/26/world/organic-food-yield/\n\nhttp://news.berkeley.edu/2014/12/09/organic-conventional-farming-yield-gap/\n\nhttp://acsh.org/news/2016/08/25/organic-farms-yield-20-fewer-crops-than-conventional-farms\n\n>necessitated by monoculture\n\nYou act like organic agriculture doesn't rely on monoculture, which is false. There are thousands of huge, corporate organic farms. \n\n>enriching the earth with nitrogen\n\nOrganic farms are notoriously deplete of nitrogen, but they rely heavily on manures. This is why organic foods tend to cause more food poisoning outbreaks. \n\n>rotating crops and planting a variety of \"breeds\" to fight against insects rather than spraying them with resistance-building and sometimes toxic insecticides, and so on.\n\nGM crops using Bt are great for improving pollinator health. It uses a certified organic pesticide which humans don't even have receptors for. Further, our stomach's pH is too low for Bt to tolerate and would break the protein down--even if we had the receptors for Bt. Most insects don't have these receptors either, so Bt crops are a great way to selectively target only the pests that harm the crop, allowing other insect species to live. This isn't the case with tons of non-GMO and certified organic pesticides.",

There's no need to know precisely how terrestrial systems work together to regulate CO2, just that excess CO2 correlates with increases in temperature, and they ought to know how to address their doubts about the validity of this data by looking at the primary sources and seeing how it was gathered. If they see a problem with the methodology, then they have a leg to stand on. \n\nI grew up where gay marriage was evil, interracial dating was at best questionable, and climate change was bullshit. The biggest qualms I see from people I know are about how accurate the data is. If vaccines cause autism, then tell me why these studies which show it doesn't are wrong. Same with global temperature data--it's such a simple matter to be able to be massively better informed. If people say the data points one way, and you believe it doesn't, then look at the data and poke holes in it. That won't convince everybody, but if you're going to ever be convinced, then the data will do the job. If nothing else, it's good to have criticism of research.\n\nAnd thanks for teaching bio majors--we're kind of boneheaded sometimes. ",

It seems bullshit science these days pays way better then real science. I mean, look at solar roadways. A completely batshit insane plan that actually has gotten government funding. (and millions worth of kickstarter funding). And the idea is completely stupid. For 1, cars drive on roads, and park on parking lots. That means the solar panels are being shaded. Which means no solar power.\n\nI mean, just back of the envelope calculations say that building a bike path down the median, and then shading it with sun tracking solar panels would generate the same wattage, for 1/100 the cost. With the bonus of getting a free (semi)shaded bike path.\n\nedit: \n\nWhats with the downvotes? Is it because we are actually thinking of taking advantage of the ignorant masses who don't even care to look into the material science of these fake kickstarters, or is it because you think solar roadways would work, and would be affordable?\n\ndouble edit:\n\njust to mention one of the more 'meh' ideas we have come up with, is thermocoupled chairs. Adult humans put off a few hundred watts of waste heat. how can we put this waste heat to use? THERMOCOUPLED CHAIRS!. Not only do they generate electricity, but they keep the chair seat nice and cool for your sitting pleasure! On paper, and in the lab, it works. About enough energy to light up a few small LEDs.. But, if I were to make a kickstarter ad, I would totally forget to mention the exotic [expensive] materials that one would need to assemble such a chair, I would also forget to mention the chair would only generate a few hundred milliwatts in the best of conditions.\n\nIf anyone wants the chair idea, be my guest! (I have much better ideas when it comes to shitty science if we decide to pursue the idea) All I ask is just send me a link to your kickstarter so I can laugh at how many gullible morons would buy into the idea.",

Even the major and central experiments on which the central theories are built.\n\nScience is a method with great limitations. Science is only a force for good when it is used correctly and responsibly. And even then science very often gets it wrong.

Communism, an ideology that slaughtered an estimated hundred million people in a few decades was proclaimed as scientific.  \n\nWhat is happening here  is some people using the label of science to promote their own narrow ideological viewpoints.\nThat is the problem.

Scientific evidence right now says that there are no severe consequences for children raised under gay parents vs. straight parents, nor are there any major psychological deficits to being gay beyond the shame that people are made to feel by those around them. Supposing this is wrong, the exact same method used to study homosexuality before could be used to study it again and find that. \n\nOk so this is a good example. \n\nSo what does science say about gay people for example? Well gay sex has led to the spread of AIDS for example, which has killed a lot of people. \n\nThen again it has not killed all that many people. And it was not only homosexuals who spread it. So what is the scientific policy on homosexual relations?\n\nThere is not a single position that is supported by science. But rather many different positions that could be taken based on the scientific knowledge about the topic.\n\n\nAnd what about homosexual parents? You say that there are \" no severe consequences for children raised under gay parents\". First of all, what are \"severe consequences\" other than a completely subjective label?\n\n\n>nor are there any major psychological deficits to being gay beyond the shame that people are made to feel by those around them.\n\nDo we know that or have we just not found any evidence of it yet? \n\nHomosexuals can not create life through making love. Is that a deficit created by the sexuality?\nIs it major? Who decides?\n\nAnd what political policies does this knowledge imply or demand? \n\nSo im not trying to argue that homosexuality is bad or that it should be banned.

I think everyone, regardless of race, sex, religion, and orientation, should be equally represented and given rights in this country, but it seems like every movement these days needs to revolve around it.

I care about politics. I care about science *in* politics*. I can read some legislation. Other pieces of legislation are like another language entirely. I can read some scientific papers. I cannot read *all* scientific papers. I firmly believe that *no one* is capable of reading and understanding *all* scientific papers. In order to do so, you would either have to be on the cutting edge of literally every scientific field in human accomplishment, or have extremely talented scientific communicators at your disposal to translate.\n\nUltimately, that's where the issue with reading journals is. Scientific communication - the ability to distill something into information that more people can understand - is not common. The people who can do it even decently are often seen as heroes to those who struggle with science. These are our Carl Sagans, our Bill Nyes, and our Neil DeGrasse Tysons. They aren't right all the time. They, also, cannot read all of the scientific papers that come out. But they can probably keep up in their particular field of interest here and there.\n\nHowever, just because someone cannot manage the time to reach some certain level of expertise in science does not mean that they do not want the scientific method to inform political decisions.\n\nIt is, after all, a result of communal effort (be it the scientific community, the political community, or the patrons of the sciences) that we have gotten so far as we have. Not everyone can be a scientist. Luckily for society, we do not need everyone to be one. However, it seems quite historically beneficial when the community, even those who were not scientists themselves, were in favor of supporting scientific research.
