As the article mentions, this is the same location where they symbolically began the second wave of the Klan in America. (First being post-Civil War; third was during the Civil Rights Movement.) Within a decade, they became a major political force and had power at *every* level of American government. I'm starting to wonder if the fourth wave has been slowly boiling under the surface since Ruby Ridge, and if there's something much more terrifying about the large gains the far right has seen in local and state government. Luckily, the populism and mob mentality that can prop you up and can quickly turn on you and bring you down.",

It was formed from a huge bubble of magma coming up through the crust and solidifying. Weathering and geologic bullshit have stripped away everything around it so you just have normal, flatish land with a towering hunk of rock sitting bare in the middle of it. They call it Stone Mountain because it's literally a gargantuan dome of granite and quartz through and through, extending underground for 9 miles at the longest points.\n\nEDIT: Extending for 9 miles across, with big portions underground. Not 9 miles straight underground.",

The libertarians I've known, when you drill down to the core, are some of the most privileged, unsympathetic, unjustly aggrieved, self-righteous and self-interested people I've ever met, at times bordering on pathology.  That they have been, nearly to a one, resentful of minorities was no surprise to me.  \n\nMore than a few (and plenty of generic conservatives) will even admit when pressed that they favor certain libertarian policies -precisely- because they believe them to be detrimental to people they consider undeserving--and surprising to no one, this list is nearly always topped by (if not composed entirely of) lazy mooching minorities.  \n\nAt the heart of it, they're angry that people they don't like are receiving \"special treatment.\"  They're angry that tax money is helping people they don't like--even when they don't pay much if any taxes themselves.  This is a partial explanation for why so many poor and working class white people in the U.S. inexplicably persist in voting against their own interests year after year--many of them KNOW Republican policies will not help them, but they don't care as long as it hurts the people they don't like -more-.  \n\nLibertarianism for them is just a way to give those shitty desires/beliefs a patina of intellectual rigor and respectability.  It's a way to create distance and make socially acceptable justifications for policies which ultimately serve to disproportionately harm minorities.  \n\n",

    "body": "It's actually a dozen or so clubs next to each other, one of which is ours. There's a very large wildlife management area (public hunting land) next to us, and the clubs are houses and large trailers that line a dirt road that runs alongside a waterway (large ditch) in which we can boat into the WMA each morning to duck hunt.\n\nI understand and respect that hunting is not for everyone, but for me hunting and the surrounding culture at its core is actually pretty fun. It's essentially a collection of guys of all ages who love to cook, drink (after the hunt!), watch football and tell ridiculous stories. Of course, we all enjoy the [challenges of hunting and beauty of nature.](http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x3se9l5) \n\nIn fact, a couple of the clubs are made up of some of my oldest, best friends, whom I see rarely due to the normalcies of life: having kids, working hard, yada yada yada. In many respects, we're a pretty diverse group (education, jobs, other interests, etc.). However, we are all Southern white males who certainly grew up more privileged than the majority of the planet. This isn't inherently wrong; my parents busted their butts and went through a lot in life to provide for me and give us a life of opportunity, and I feel they instilled in me good values. \n\nBut, for some people at these clubs, it's a sort of bragging right and used to justify racist beliefs in an us vs. them kind of way. And I'm not talking about just joking around. I'm talking about seriously idiotic and offensive remarks (most black people are lazy criminals or welfare dependent, all Muslims are terrorists, left-leaning Americans are actively trying to transform it into a third-world country, etc.) -- all of which are often followed by, \"I'm serious! I mean it!\" In the same breath, these people will also claim to not be racist and have \"black friends,\" which are a couple of people they buy drugs from, or former fellow service-members, whom they haven't seen since Iraq and would be outraged at their remarks.\n\nWhat's also sad is that when these things are said, they're always met with chuckles. So, even if the people are being laughed *at* by people who I know are good spirited, they probably feel they're being laughed with. \n\nWhen there, and primarily with a group of 20 or so people, I hear this shit at least 2-3 times per day from 1-2 people. So, it doesn't encapsulate the whole duck-club experience or everyone there ... but it's super frustrating and sort of ruins for me the whole experience, which is mostly a lot of fun.",
