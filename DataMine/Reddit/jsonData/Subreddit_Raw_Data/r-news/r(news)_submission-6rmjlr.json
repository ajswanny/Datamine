He said he would be exiting MSMB (after lying about doubling investors money, not losing everyone's money), and investors could cash out or convert to shares of Retrophin (which he never delivered on). He attempted to make people whole by using it as his personal banking service to cover his losses.  \n\n\nAccording to an indictment, instead of telling investors that he had lost their money, on September 10, 2012, he sent an e-mail claiming he had \u201cjust about doubled their money net of fees,\u201d\u2014previously having told one investor that MSMB had $35 million in its coffers when actually only $700 remained.

Seems to be coming from people not knowing how actually bad the pharma industry really is, and not knowing shkreli is right at their level, even below it in some regards. Im going to guess not many even know of his Chagas scheme, which was really slimy. \n\nWith the express approval pass, there is a bit of a loop hole where the intent was to encourage providing treatments for rare conditions, notably in areas of third world countries where there is a lack of attention, and the FDA awards basically an express lane certificate nearly halving the amount of time they would take to approve drugs (which itself is a whole deal where now efforts at FDA must be removed from useful drugs to ones that are basic combination therapies). This is worth billions to a company.  These can be bought and sold. Skirelli douche was planning on using the loophole for approving the treatment for Chagas' disease, basically something not needed at all, in order to get a certificate and sell it for possibly hundreds of millions. \n\nHe acquired Kalobios under shady pretenses, and then right away paid 2 million bucks for the rights to a Tx for chaggas disease. Roche long ago had donated the rights of the drug to the Brazilian government. It was widely available world wide, distributed by the CDC, however, never actually approved officially by America's FDA. Because of the amount of data available on the drug, so open for so long, they were hoping to not have to actually run any trials to be granted approval. You don't actually have to invent the drug to get the voucher, in hind sight, probably a large issue overlooked. So this douche again, was attempting to use loopholes in a system to obtain a voucher, intended to be given to those researching and developing drugs for rare and underdeveloped indications particularly in poor countries, in order to turn 2 mill into 400 million. Without doing any R&D. Shows how much he truly cared about that aspect. And this voucher, would likely be used to bring out a block buster drug, probably not novel or lifesaving, likely just a \"me too\",  a few months earlier to market, while at the same time, delaying another drug from coming onto market. \n\n\n",

    "body": "Hardly. \n\nIf anything it's the slacktivism effect. \n\nPeople wanna do something without actually doing something so now that they've made him he bad guy and he got punished, their jobs of online outrage are over! They fixed the Pharma industry and get to feel good about it! \n\nI once signed a change.org petition. I still get dumbass emails about shit I might be interested in. 99% of it is just dumb outrage culture. It's a group of people that fixated on one instance of something and ignore the rest, while thinking they actually accomplished something meaningful. \n\nSome of the petitions are downright disgusting. Such as the ones where they beg for signatures to prosecute people to \"the fullest extent of the law\". I'm sure what that person did was heinous, but I don't want to live in a world where punishment is decided by people's feelings and petition signature and not a court and judge of trained and professional people. \n\nBetter to let 10 guilty men walk free than falsely imprison one innocent man. \n\nBut these these show that people just want to feel good, not do anything that's right. What will we do when one day these petitions and such target an innocent man? \n\nQe: I believe one Petition I got was literally called \"stop animal abuse\". What the fuck is the point? Yes I want to stop it. Do you really need a petition for that? What the fuck does signing that accomplish? Fucking nothing. But people will sign it and think they did something. Which is fine, let them do them. But I still think it's stupid. As if animal cruelty is legal or most people don't want to stop it... so fucking patronizing and stupid.  ",

For example, you can leverage the roles/responsibility of the accused to at least establish negligence. Moving beyond negligence is where it gets tough. You need to essentially establish an intent to commit fraud. \n\nYou also need to consider what the ultimate goal of pursuing fraud investigation is. More often than not it's about recouping the lost funds rather than criminal conviction. If you're a medium sized business and someone stole a million dollars from you, I'm sure you'd be much more worried about the money than getting the person convicted. On top of that, many of the times the accused cannot repay which results in reliance on Fraud Insurance. This is where the concept of benefit comes in again. Most fraud insurance companies refuse to pay out unless you can clearly prove benefit on the end of the accused. \n\nI work in Canada so the exact processes may be a bit different where you live.",

The people at the bottom stand a hypothetical chance of also making a ton of money if they can recruit people beneath them but we all know that it becomes unsustainable as the pyramid grows.\n\nA ponzi scheme is when you pay investors with money coming from other investors rather than money which was earner through investments. A common saying is \"rob peter to pay paul\". \n\nA ponzi scheme is 100% illegal but I'm not certain on the legality of pyramid schemes.",
