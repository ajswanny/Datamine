    "body": "I wish, when I got my cats declawed, they would have told me more about it. I thought it was basically like surgically removing fingernails. Turns out it's a lot worse than that and, often enough, it's permanently painful.\n\nMy cats personalities changed negatively after I got them declawed. Biggest. Mistake. Ever.\n\nedit: I can't possibly respond to all the comments so I'll try and make notes here:\n\n- Permanent pain. A quick good (years later) showed me that often enough the declawing process hurts their hands making it painful to walk. Imagine getting your fingers surgically cut to the knuckle and having no way to communicate that they fucked up.\n- My cats don't go outside. They don't have claws. I'm not a complete fool.\n- I didn't research it beforehand because I had cats when I was younger that were declawed and they didn't seem to mind. I was also a kid so not like I knew any better. It wasn't until a news article talked about it that I put some research into it. I'm pretty sure you don't do thorough research about getting your tonsils removed, do you? Similar thing, or so I thought. It's a common procedure so what's the big deal? That was my thought process.\n- Personality change. They were **super** playful before the declawing. Now one *hates* the other and is bitter / angry. The angry one hates all humans and living creatures but me. It purrs like a monster with me but can't stand anyone else. The other one is not playful at all. In fact neither are playful. They both love attention from me in small bursts. They do not play well with other animals -- they run in fear or hiss loudly and run. Before they should significantly more curiosity. \n- I adopted them from the SPCA. They were fostered and didn't have a mother so who knows what quirks are caused from this.\n- I'm probably never getting cats again after this but I'm also not giving them away. They really only like me. My grandmother watched over them for a few months while I got my landlord at my apartment to let me have them live with me -- they stayed hidden 90% of the time those entire months. So I can't give them away even if I wanted to -- they'd never acclimate to anywhere else. It wouldn't be right.",

Even when he was playing with you, if his claws made contact with your skin he'd instantly retract the claws and lick you to make sure you're ok. \n\nThen my dad took him in to get his claws removed because \"The damn cat is scratching up the couch\". He got my cat mutilated so he could keep the quality of his *furniture*. \n\nGeorge was ok for a couple years, but then he started doing weird stuff. He stopped going to the bathroom in the litter box, but would poop RIGHT outside it. Whenever he'd go into the cat box, he would cry. My dad was just getting more and more annoyed at him, and then I finally convinced him to take George to the vet. \n\nSo apparently when you rip out the bones for the declawing, the hole in the flesh was never filled up with scar tissue. It just stays empty. And every time he would try to use the litter box, more and more sand would jam itself into the hole. I watched the vets clean out **2 years worth** of litter jammed into his paw. I felt awful, he was such a good, loving cat, and he was in constant pain and couldn't tell us. \n\nWe ended up changing his litter to some cardboard stuff, but the damage had already been done. He refused to go to the bathroom in the litter box anymore. My dad waited for me to leave home one day to take him to the pound because he just didn't want to deal with George anymore. \n\n[Here's my old Georgie-porgie.

    "body": "So let me detail how these surgeries are often performed in my area as an ex-vet assistant. Often done at the same time as spaying or neutering, the surgery is usually performed on young cats to minimize the stress from being put under anesthesia. Pain management is important afterwards, but some cats experience mania with opioids so it can often worsen injury. It was pretty common to find the recovery cages covered in bloody paw prints because the cats had freaked out after waking up. Our practice kept the cats for a day to ensure that they woke up alright before sending them home.\n\nDuring the procedure, each toe is opened up and the bone is exposed. The last joint of each \"finger\" is amputated with a scalpel or laser if the cat is lucky and the vet is up to date on their practices. If not, a guillotine pair of nail clippers is used and the amputation often leaves chunks of bone or even some nail tissue still in the wound. The paws are sutured and bandaged and the cat goes to recovery. \n\nIn the best case scenario, there is little surrounding trauma and the wound is fairly clean cut. Even with a skilled vet, however, there is a risk of infection and further complications years down the line as the parts amputated also help shape and distribute weight when the cat walks. \n\nIn a worse case scenario, such as with the guillotine clippers, there is nail tissue left in the wound which can still grow into a deformed claw and cause damage to the surrounding tissue. Incorrectly amputated joints can also cause more damage down the line with scar tissue and damage to the tendons. The cat may need corrective surgery later, though this is unlikely. Most people simply disown the cat or euthanize it due to behavior problems caused by the chronic pain. After all, who wants to deal with a cat that pees outside the box or is even downright aggressive. \n\nI didn't support declawing before working in the vet industry, and I definitely don't support it now.

    "body": "Veterinarian here.  I'd like to provide some more in depth insight as to why some doctors choose to perform this procedure.  I assure you the ones that do are not monsters that are only doing it for money.  They are more than aware of the complications of the procedure than any redditors are and most only perform it as a last resort.  I personally do not like declawing cats but will do it if necessary.  The procedure is the same as amputating your finger at the level of the knuckle below your nail bed.  Brutal stuff...\n\nIn the US, approximately 6.5 million animals enter the shelters annually (numbers according to the ASPCA).  Of those 6.5 million, 3.2 million are cats.  Of those 3.2 million cats, about 860,000 do not find homes and are euthanized.  Another relevant piece of information is how much longer cats are in the shelter from time of entrance to the shelter til time of adoption compared to dogs (I do not have numbers to back this up but work extensively with a local shelter and can attest that the number is significantly larger than dogs).  Finally, pet problems are the most common reason for rehoming them aka ending up in a shelter.  42% of cats are rehomed due to these problems (behavioral, aggression, health problems owners couldn't handle).  My fear of the ban is this, if you suddenly make declawing cats illegal nationwide, you're potentially going to have a much higher number of cats entering shelters and a potential much lower rate of cats being adopted.  Should a veterinarian ensure that they've tried everything possible to prevent scratching behaviors at home prior to surgery, absolutely.  Are the owners always willing to try everything (nail trims, behavioral modification, numerous scratching posts, soft paws, medications if anxiety is believed to play a role), usually not.  I personally believe that while the procedure can be painful and for a lack of a better term brutal for the animal, I think that short term pain is better than being dead or living as a stray (which is also brutal).  I perform this procedure with a specialized laser to prevent bleeding, excessive swelling and to reduce chance of infection and a lot of other veterinarians use other techniques that are also perfectly acceptable.  My main point is that from the outside without considering all of the aspects of this procedure, the majority of people think it should be banned immediately while the numbers can tell a different story.  I know that in Europe this procedure is mostly outlawed, but I do not have numbers or statistics of animals in shelters or rehomed for comparison.  If someone has this information I'd love to see it from a reliable source.  \n\nTLDR:\nVets that perform this procedure aren't all monsters.  Sometimes declawing a cat is the only way to prevent them from being euthanized or rehomed.  Is it ideal? No it isn't but I would consider it a necessary evil in some but not all cases.  Owners sometimes do not have the time, money or patience to commit to attempting behavior modification and stopping destructive behavior.  ",

I can't imagine completely removing claws! They're so intricate in their paws (they can extend/retract them in a way). Declawing sounds torturous :(  \n  \nEdit; Thanks for the tips on shorting his nails! He does have a scratchpost that he uses a lot so he tends self-dull his nails with it. Just sometimes they splinter a little bit at the tip and need to be cut shorter so he doesn't get stuck on fabrics. I'll ask my vet to be sure on how to trim them myself and see from there (if my cat lets me haha..)  \n",

Let them pull their paws away from you if they don't enjoy it, just continue the cuddle sesh as usual. The goal is to get them - over time - gradually more comfortable with having their feet handled by you. If your cat responds well upgrade from touching to [holding the paw and pushing gently on it so the claw comes out just like you will do later when cutting](https://i.imgur.com/i4VmeEa.jpg). It doesn't hurt to give a treat after.\n\nMake sure you know what you are doing when you do attempt to cut for the first time though. Do your own research and/or talk with a vet or a pro. Most important thing though: Only cut the tip of the claw. Don't cut too deep! [The pink \"core\", AKA quick, inside a cat's claw has nerves so cutting that will hurt and it will start to bleed.](https://i.imgur.com/1atyVFd.jpg)\n\nEdit - A good summary: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7KcGivV0-I",

Some need to be wrapped in a towel, some need a constant source of high value treats, some need to be approached when asleep and I can get 3-5 claws done...\n\nI have a BUNCH of cats now. Many cats. \nI have a hell of a time clipping any of them now. It takes a whole day to get them done. It can take ten or fifteen minutes now, to catch one and get them wrapped in a towel and get ONE paw done. By the time that paw is done, the cat has had it with me. Off and running. And the whole time I'm trying to clip - kitty is growling a warning to the rest of the house. When I go to grab the next cat, they've all disappeared. \n\nI used to be able to clip all the cats we had when I was a kid every other week. Now I'm older, slower, and less graceful. \n\nDespite my failings- we have a leather couch in pristine condition and we have seven cats. That's 126 cat claws. The cats never ever ever claw the furniture. I do have one little cat who goes crazy and starts clawing one patch of my carpet every couple of weeks, but he's a weirdo. ",

His front claws were worse than the back. It\u2019s like they just weren\u2019t growing in correctly.

Most of the time, this cat was a real sweety, but every once in a while it would completely spaz and attack the nearest person. It caused serious damage when it did, too, almost blinding my friend's mom once. The situation finally got to the point where the choices were euthanasia or declawing. The psychotic episodes still happened, but it was like being beaten by cotton balls - much safer for the victim. And the cat got to live a full life in a loving household (he actually passed away this year). So yeah, in general I feel like declawing is awful, but in this case it saved a cat's life. ",

But my cats never go outside.\n\nMy wife's son is also type 1 Diabetic and he's prone to getting an infection easily also.",

    "body": "> Sometimes declawing a cat is the only way to prevent them from being euthanized or rehomed. \n\nI will admit, I knew my cat prior to her being my cat. She was adopted out, by me and my family who found her abandoned, to an old woman living in an apartment building. And the one condition was that she had to be declawed because 1) apartment building rules and 2) she was a VERY old lady and could not risk getting infection or whatever from kitty scratches. So it was done, and at the time I did support the decision, because it meant my cat would have an extremely loving home with a nice old lady, an easy life, pampered.\n\nBut then the old woman passed away. And now that the cat is my and my husband's cat, our only pet, I do feel bad about her being declawed. But at the time it was this necessary evil - if she wanted a home, that was the price. It sucks but I had no one else to take her, and for a time that old lady had a little kitten that she loved to bits and the cat had a home with an owner that loved her. Now she's with me, and I love her too, and I give her scratching posts and stuff and she scratches even without the claws.\n\nIt would just break my heart if people saw my cat and thought, \"gee, she's a bad pet owner because her cat is declawed\" when there's so much more to the story than that....",

I'm not sure how amputation which can lead to lifelong pain gets brushed aside in favor of a sofa.

She's been trying to get me to ditch my cat, telling me I've given him a good life and taken such good care of him.

Our good boy kneads into blankets a lot, and soft cushions, but it's all knit or woven fabric cushions, so never leaves any visible damage, and he never tears/scratches things with his claws. Leather is definitely a lot less forgiving though, so I definitely know not to get leather furniture if I also want cats. Although I don't like leather furniture anyway, so win/win.",

If you so desire, for an extra cost, the remains can be dressed up in one of four selections specifically selected to cause as much anguish as possible.  Or if you would prefer to deny the closure a potential burial could allow, he can present you with a notarized letter saying there were complications during the procedure and processing and the pet may have not been able to go peacefully, as a new handler was unable to properly perform the cervical dislocation procedure and several pets struggled for a while.  But not to fear because only four of the scheduled nine underwent the procedural attempt before deciding that it was best to transfer the animals to varried shelters further away that use chemical methods instead.  When your soon-to-be ex calls back asking what happened to their pet specifically, I the secretary, will inform them that we've lost the paperwork for the transfers and the bodies were incinerated (one may have still been alive during the inceration).  I'll provide them with a list of all of the shelters we do transfers for and let them know that some of the shelters have a policy of listing the pet for adoption for a two month period prior to euthanizing.  This usually causes a frantic search for the pet, but all the while they are questioning if the pet died horribly.  Some of these shelters have transfer policies and shitty secretaries of their own, so they will never get to truly know what happened to the pet in question, all while fearing the worst. \n\nEdit: And for an upkeep cost, I'll search for pets that match the description of the now deceased pet and if you let me know that the other party appears to be resigned to the fact that the pet is dead or lost, update them that we may have found their pet.",

The cats have nearly a dozen scratching posts including a floor-to-ceiling cat tree, and different materials like carpet and braided cord and cardboard, but they still scratch up the house instead.\n\nOne of them has destroyed the corner of a leather sofa. She scratches it every day instead of the scratching posts. We tried putting tape sticky-side-out on the sofa for over a week and she went right back to it when the tape was gone.\n\nOne of them jumps up on window sills around the house, which leaves scratch marks in the paint and even into the wood from extending her claws for traction. Again, we tried spraying her with water when she'd do it, we tried putting foil and tape on window sills so she wouldn't want to, but she still does it. When she was a kitten she'd climb door jambs floor-to-ceiling and scratch those up too.\n\nThe other one just pees on things. Carpet, clothes, etc. She's got multiple clean litter boxes, gets plenty of stimulation and attention, and she sees a vet regularly and has had bloodwork done so there's no underlying health issues... she just pees outside the litterbox on purpose sometimes. Enough times that it won't come out of the carpet in certain spots, so when we go to sell the house it all has to be replaced because of this cat.\n\nSo yeah, every cat we've owned has ruined the house to some degree.",

You never know with a cat when they will just decide this leg of the dining room table is their new scratching post.

But that first year or two of a cat's life is a roller coaster.  Makes sense too, its what we should expect.   \n\nHumans usually get all their destructive tendencies out in the first 20% of their life span.   Your behavior goes through far less changes between 40 and 50 years of age then it did between 10 and 20 years of age.    Adult cats aren't considering going emo, but your baby kitten's goth phase might be just around the corner.  \n\nThis is also a problem with dogs too.  But dogs are far more trainable.  You have to be the cat whisperer to make every kitten into a good grown up cat.  But as long as your a semi-competent and willing to put the time in most people can take a puppy and insure that they grow up to be a good boy.

And yes, she was truly abandoned. Her mom had the kittens under a neighbor's deck, got scared, and moved all of the kittens to a new unknown location except one.  2 1/2 days of watching and hearing the tiny 4 week old kitten wander around my yard meowing for mom was enough for me. \n\nTurns out the kitten became a complete feline terror. We let her age 8 months without declawing while trying alternatives. The final straw was when she kept doing sneak attacks on my daughter and completely clawing her legs. So it was either declawing, bringing her to a shelter to join to 75+ other cats that are there (and most will likely die there), booting her out the door with no life experience to face the coyotes, or just putting her down. \n\nCall me heartless but I declawed the little terror on paws. Her recovery was less than a week before she was back to normal. It took a few years but the little terror finally (mostly) mellowed with age. She won't be my closest cat emotionally but she certainly has earned her place. \n\nFor what it's worth, I've had other cats with claws and it wasn't an issue. \n\nSo down vote away, but declawing has it's place.",

The amount of sheer stupidity I see on a daily basis is beyond your wildest dreams, and I feel so bad for some of these animals.\n\nLady comes in, says she wants an electric device (I don't remember the name of it) to stop her dogs from barking. I ask her what kind of dogs they are. This woman has three huskies. If you know huskies, you know that they are very high-energy and very talkative. These dogs *need* mental and physical stimulation, and lots of it. I ask her what she does to provide them with it, she says she just leaves them out in the yard most of the day. \n\nI was already ticked off at this point, but *then* she goes on to say that she doesn't want them to bark at all. So if these dogs bark for *any* reason, they will get shocked. I flat out tell her that she shouldn't have dogs and that I will not sell her the device. She wants to talk to my manager, but he's standing behind me and reiterates that we will not sell her the device. \n\nI just??????
