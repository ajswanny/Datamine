That guy is usually dropping off food and water for the child slaves they have in the house.",

Nobody really even realized they were so successful until one day the UN mentioned them in a statement. \n\nSuddenly everyone was like \"Who the hell are these truckers?\" and it turned out that there was this huge group of volunteer truckers going around hunting for traffickers and turning them in. \n\nTruckers are under 1% of the U.S. population, but responsible for nearly 1 in 5 convictions of traffickers. \n\nIt's about time somebody like Ashton stepped up and did the same thing.

Kutcher is also an investor that has invested in many tech companies including Skype, and airbnb. He even worked for Lenovo as a product engineer. Check out his wiki. I think why you are taking flack is it sounds like you are trying to discredit this obviously intelligent man because he is an \"actor\".",

    "body": "chiefly because they are widening the definition of the term. If you look at the previous post \"pertaining to sex trafficking\" ... the key word is *pertaining*. \n\nThe most recent \"Super Bowl\" bust (that had nothing to do with the Super Bowl), they cited over 500 arrests \"related to sex trafficking\" ... it was basically related to prostitution. Some of it was sex trafficking some of it was related to prostitution but they are being lumped together now.\n\nThe difference is supposed to be: sex trafficking = coercion, fraud or force of an adult into the sex trade OR any involvement of a minor, prostitution then would be what's left over. Adults acting willingly. \n\nI don't know the breakdown, but obviously if you add everyone in the \"willingly\" group to the \"unwillingly\" group you can inflate the numbers. \n\nIts the ends justifying the means, trying to increase the visibility of the problem, and to increase stigma and use that to fight both sex trafficking and prostitution. \n\nProstitution is not even illegal everywhere in the USA let alone in the world, and in some places though illegal, it is tolerated. There is a school of thought that all prostitution is violence against women so needs to be stamped out and this school of thought is gaining a lot of traction. \n\nBy this mode of thinking, the woman is always a victim of violence even if she is willing, offering and acting on her own and a man is always a predator committing a violent act when money is exchanged for sex. \n\nThus, when you make an arrest in this kind of case, what you have done is arrested a sex trafficker (the man) and freed a victim (the woman) who is now offered counselling and assistance to get out of the sex trade. If she is legitimately a victim then she takes them up on the offer but if she's willing she just walks and repeats. \n\nThe goal in this then is to reduce demand by making it too risky for men to be involved by increasing their punishment and stigma associated with it. And there is political cover for this because you're treating all the women as victims so nobody can try to portray what you're doing as punishing women. \n\nHowever, willing women sex workers will have their source of income dried up and be forced out of something that they want to do. \n\nIf I told you that you had freedom of choice to eat any ice cream flavor you want, because it is a free country and I don't want to judge you or restrict your choices, then I told manufacturers that it was illegal to make any flavor of ice cream except for vanilla, I could play both sides at the same time.\n\nTelling you that you are free to choose, and so appearing virtuous, while completely restricting your choice to the only choice I want you to have. \n\nSo this is the means to the end, to stomp out prostitution. \n\nThere is about 100% absolute consensus that sexual trafficking as defined is morally wrong, while consenting activity between adults is considered acceptable by a sizeable percentage of people and not a huge problem by others. So if you want to stomp out prostitution entirely, your path is clear, by conflating everything together and then using the moral outrage to empower you to do what you think is necessary. \n\nAs a side note, going after the paying party in a consensual transaction between adults is kind of like going after the buyer of drugs and letting the dealer walk. You eliminate the dealers by making it too risky for the buyers to buy. It can work in the case where buyers are often married, affluent and have a lot to lose if they get caught. Meanwhile a lot of escorts advertise online showing their faces. You can't stigma them out of the business. But you can stigma the clients out and thus force the woman to find another job.\n\n",

The other side is already discussed above. \n\nGetting caught in the crossfire means that you will be accused of a lot of stuff and it's just not worth it.\n\nThe hysteria though is going up and this whole \"Super Bowl Sting\" didn't even happen at the super bowl. It was a 3 week 14 state sting catching people locally. Not all looking for minors, probably some, but they didn't go out of their way to explain any of it. \n\nThey ended the sting on Super Bowl Sunday so they could get a press release out of it. If you stopped at the headline you thought 500 sex traffickers were caught at the Super Bowl.\n\nBut it was 500 guys over 3 weeks and 14 states. On average this huge sting meant to catch all these bad guys rounded up maybe 16 guys per state per week. \n\nThat's your basic cop standing on a street corner pretending to be a hooker. Place a couple of ads on back page and nail who comes up. Then say you busted a sex trafficking ring. \n\nThen they are saying there are millions of children out there... why didn't they find any with this big 3 week bust? Why are they trying to claim it was at the super bowl and it wasn't?\n\nIf they have this great case, let's see evidence that it's going on.\n\nBy all means save every child and punish every predator. But I will trust them more when they're not exaggerating on the level of a Trump announcement. \n\nBut if it is a serious problem why gear the entire thing over how to get the best press release out of it. It should have been geared to breaking real rings and running until they broke the rings. \n\nThey just went whelp, made the PR and went on their ways. \n\nLike Trump saying the voter fraud is there but just not reported and then using evidence of other things to say that it's all voter fraud. If it's not reported it's evidence of how well covered up it is... \n\nIn this case, when they actively lie and distort these numbers and claims it makes me feel like they don't have any real data or evidence to back up these huge numbers they keep talking about.

    "body": "I understand your comment completely my friend, I too have been hurt in more ways than one. Not molested but I feel a bit scarred...\nWhat I'm saying derives from a \"higher\" level of consciousness or an attempt at it. It comes from a place of wanting to resolve the issue full stop. I'm sick and tired of seeing broken people, broken kids whose lives have been destroyed because WE as people didn't understand that if We don't show compassion to pedophiles they will have no reason to try and be open about and seek help, therefore understanding that they need to be helped and not hurt a child! We need to understand that pedophilia is a sickness and those who have those feelings need to be helped more than jailed to prevent the vicious circle we find ourselves in today.\nWe punish and shame pedophiles so they hide, which makes it harder for us to find them... If we were open about pedophilia, people who suffered from it wouldn't feel so \" abused \", in my opinion and those who practice it or feel attraction toward children would more easily seek help. Am I an idealist? Perhaps, but like I said, I'm tired of recognizing that our current methodology is only a treatment, not a cure to the issue. We have to dig deeper.",
