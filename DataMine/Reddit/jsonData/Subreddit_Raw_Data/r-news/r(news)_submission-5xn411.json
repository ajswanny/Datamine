E.g  a few weeks back the goverment issued an upgrade order to one of our central train stations, they built most of the time during Saturdays. Religous riots started to stop the building process on their holy \"day off\" which resulted in a major slow down of the whole process and prevented a bunch of people to have an easy way for them to get to work. So yeah religion can be a cultural thing but definitely not in charge of a country.",

There's a lot of emerging legal theory arguing that traffic violations are basically general warrants (thus unconstitutional). \n\nIt's been a little while since my 4th Amendment criminal procedure course, but basically it goes:\n\n 1) Cops can stop and arrest you for minor traffic violations that are just impose civil fines (failure to use a turn signal, missing taillight, not wearing a seat belt, etc).\n\n 2) When they stop you, they can search your person and within your reaching distance, including any pockets, etc. When you enter the jail, they conduct a search for any contraband anyway.\n\n 3) When you get arrested, police departments can tow/impound your car. When they do so, they traditionally conduct inventory/administrative searches (which, to be fair is mainly to cover their asses, so they have documentation of what was in your car in case something comes up missing). They can then seize any contraband they find in the vehicle. \n\nSo even without \"smelling\" marijuana, they can just arrest you and conduct whatever search for any traffic violation . . . **plus**, even if they pull you over for something that ends up not being a traffic violation (i.e., cop wrong about the law), they can still do all of the above and any evidence they seize is still admissible. I don't remember the case, but the majority's quote was something along the lines of *there are too many traffic violations, so it's unreasonable to expect officers to know all of them. Therefore, even if officers are wrong about stopping someone for violations, this should be a good faith exception to the exclusionary rule.*\n\nI know you're more addressing the asset forfeiture than just arrest, but I think it all fits together.

Not to mention the Minnesotan MMJ program. Leaf Line Labs, AKA Bachmans, aren't able to grow good weed whatsoever. They grow wonderful plants for home gardens, but when it comes to producing medical ganja, they suck. So in Minnesota, we are looking at $240 a gram for shit oil. You can't get good medicine from shitty source material. It's simply not possible. Minnesota is a flower free medicinal program, oil only, but it all originates with how well the flower was created. \n\n The Marlboro Red equivalent for cannabis would be brown brick weed from back in the day. Expectations for flower have grown exponentially in the past decade and a half alone. Bugs aren't the only problem, mold is a big one as well. Curing is equally, if not more important for cannabis than how it's cultivated. It's a very finicky thing to grow if you're aiming for quality. We need to be thinking about it more similarly to growing high quality food. \n\nSmall batches are absolutely the way to go, but people looking to cannabis to make money aren't going to pay attention to that. For the most part it seems they simply don't care, they just want to cash in. ",

That's why weed isn't just illegal, it's classified by the DEA to be more dangerous than opioids and meth. Weed is a cheap source of recreational drug use and solves other things, like anxiety, insomnia, and provides pain relief. Oh, and legalization would significantly cripple the Mexican cartels.\n\nSuddenly, a huge portion of the population wouldn't need sleeping pills, anxiety pills, or opioids. Believe it or not, the opioid industry is completely okay with people becoming addicted to their drug. They are not just okay with it, they want it to happen.\n\nAnd Canada has shown at times to be completely on the corporation's side at the expense of its citizens.
