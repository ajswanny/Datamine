Note that the contract terms say nothing about forcing you to leave a plane **after you've already boarded**.\n\nIt seems to me the two are very different, and United may not have a legal leg to stand on here.

I could have stayed with a buddy in Denver, but I really just wanted to keep moving towards home.\n\nThats when everything went to fuck.\n\nLanded in Texas around 11pm to find that there wasnt going to be any hotel. Nascar or something was in town and everything was booked. Needless to say, everybody was furious that night. They seriously gave us a blanket in a plastic bag, a cot and a measly 14 dollars in food vouchers. Which was adding insult to injury, since all the food places were closed. It was aweful. I would have gone to sleep hungry if I had gotten any sleep. The voucher barely got me two stiff drinks in the morning. And I shit you not they boarded us on the morning flight and DELAYED AND KICKED US OFF THE PLANE for another hour. When we got on the next flight we didn't celebrate until we were in the air. I finally got home to see my dad after an excruciating two days of hell. They fucked up treating us the way they did, and were seeing more of it now.\n\n[I live tweeted the event](https://twitter.com/MiketheEye/status/586781707480629248)\n\nAll the airlines are fucked because we really dont have a lot of choices, but seriously fuck United.

They did essentially the exact opposite and said things are fine and this is acceptable when a lot of people *very much* don't see it that way.\n\nThat is probably going to be more damaging to United, because it shows a lack of good judgement and social media savvy. This could have been a very temporary PR hiccup where they give some platitudes, pay the guy a token sum of money, and claim to be investigating employees and just let the whole thing die. But now they took a public stance and made the worst situation possible from a PR standpoint: A public conversation about if you violently assaulted a customer or not.\n\nAgain, this isn't about if United was, or was not, justified in what they did.

Indeed, in 2011 the agency doubled the eligible compensation that involuntarily bumped passengers are entitled to receive. If the airline is able to get you to your domestic destination within two hours of the original arrival time, you are entitled to a cash refund of twice the cost of the one-way ticket to a maximum of $650.\n\n>If the involuntary bump lands you in your destination more than two hours late, you are due an amount equivalent to four times the cost of your ticket to a maximum of $1,300. The rule is the same for international flights, except that the DOT defines \"short\" international delays (which net up to $650) as those that get you to your destination within four hours of the original arrival time. Those that get you to an international destination more than four hours late entitle you to $1,300.\n\n>**It's worth noting that most airlines will try to pay this fee in travel vouchers, but you can demand a check. The DOT regulation requires the airline to give you cash compensation if that's what you prefer**, Hobica said.",

They can \"Involuntarily Deny Boarding\" to anyone they want based on rules they deem fair when the flight is oversold, but oversold means that the number of tickets sold exceeds the number of available seats.   \n\nOnce you are issued a seat assignment, and you have boarded, that seat is yours unless you forfeit it through a number of actions related to disorderly conduct, drunkenness, terrorism, etc.  \n\nThere is no avenue for a carrier to eject you from a properly ticketed seat once you have boarded.  \n\nThe entire rule making process was designed to accommodate carriers desire to oversell seats, not for them to be able to eject passengers because of last minute crew changes or schedule changes.\n\nAdditionally, even in the case of a legitimate reason to eject a passenger from a ticketed and boarded seat, the airline must not use more force then reasonably necessary to remove him.  It is very easy in my opinion to argue that the airline, knowing Chicago police/aviation security, should have known that they would use or might use more than a reasonable amount of force.  Given that not a single video clip shows the passenger acting dangerously, or doing anything other than speaking at a relatively normal tone of voice until physically assaulted, I think anyone trying to defend this as a reasonable amount of force would be sadly treated in front of a jury.",

Since taking the reins of United in late-2015, Munoz\u2019s communication strategy has been based, in part, on speaking openly and honestly about improving the airline while inviting customers and employees to contribute their ideas on how the company could better serve them. So far the results have confirmed that he\u2019s on the right track: through the end of 2016, United boasted record-breaking on-time performance and has seen its customer satisfaction scores climb.\n\n>Munoz has repeatedly referred to United as a \u201cpeople business,\u201d and his strategy from day one has been to reconnect with employees and customers. That philosophy was best summed up in his remarks when accepting the award on behalf of United\u2019s more than 87,000 employees, saying, \u201cCommunication and communication strategy is not just part of the game, it is the game.\u201d\n\n>In an article published last week, PRWeek detailed its reasons for selecting him: \u201cMunoz has shown himself to be a smart, dedicated, and excellent leader who understands the value of communications. His ability to connect and share with employees his vision for the airline, and get them to rally behind it, is a key reason PRWeek named him 2017 Communicator of the Year.\u201d",

If he bumped that to 1.2% ($73,000), then they could cover one $200 reimbursement every day of the year.\n\nJust some trivia.

This myth that passengers don't have rights needs to go away, ASAP. You are dead wrong when saying that United legally kicked him off the plane.\n\n1. First of all, it's airline spin to call this an overbooking. The statutory provision granting them the ability to deny boarding is about \"OVERSALES\", specifically defines as booking more reserved confirmed seats than there are available. This is not what happened. They did not overbook the flight; they had a fully booked flight, and not only did everyone already have a reserved confirmed seat, they were all sitting in them. The law allowing them to denying boarding in the event of an oversale does not apply.\n\n2. Even if it did apply, the law is unambiguously clear that airlines have to give preference to everyone with reserved confirmed seats when choosing to involuntarily deny boarding. They have to always choose the solution that will affect the least amount of reserved confirmed seats. This rule is straightforward, and United makes very clear in their own contract of carriage that employees of their own or of other carriers may be denied boarding without compensation because they do not have reserved confirmed seats. On its face, it's clear that what they did was illegal-- they gave preference to their employees over people who had reserved confirmed seats, in violation of 14 CFR 250.2a.\n\n3. Furthermore, even if you try and twist this into a legal application of 250.2a and say that United had the right to deny him boarding in the event of an overbooking; they did NOT have the right to kick him off the plane. Their contract of carriage highlights there is a complete difference in rights after you've boarded and sat on the plane, and Rule 21 goes over the specific scenarios where you could get kicked off. NONE of them apply here. He did absolutely nothing wrong and shouldn't have been targeted. He's going to leave with a hefty settlement after this fiasco.\n\nNot my post, taken from: https://thepointsguy.com/2017/04/your-rights-on-involuntary-bumps/",

Outside of those reasons, any dispute must be in favor of the passenger.  United wrote their own very long contract.  They had the opportunity to cover this specific situation and chose not to.  It's not that they didn't think of it.  They most certainly did.  They chose not to.  Likely because a blanket clause for that situation creates more problems than it solves.\n\nUnited does not get the benefit of the doubt.  Even if that's your instinct, they don't legally get it.",

Every other flight back to the UK got filled immediately by more experienced travellers so my wife was stranded. \n\nShe called me in a bit of a panic so we looked around and I found a seat back, it was First Class on British Airways and was *quite* expensive. Anyway, you can't put a price on peace of mind so we just went for it. When she got back we applied for compensation from EasyJet, thinking we'd at least get the cost of the original flight plus a bit extra for the inconvenience. They refunded the whole price of the First Class ticket. EasyJet is not a prestige carrier, by any stretch of the imagination, but they did the decent thing. ",

They give me half hearted services and charge fees out of my ass as soon as they can while give me an expectation that I supposed to be pampered like a god in the sky. At least Spirit has the balls to say \"our seats suck, and we give you nothing on flight, but hey, we're cheap\". The \"set high expectation\" and charge accordingly is what pissed me off. And they are not even that cheap (no where near spirit or frontier) \n\nI flight southwest if it spirit can't cover. Southwest is just slightly more expensive than United, but they practically pamper me. ",
