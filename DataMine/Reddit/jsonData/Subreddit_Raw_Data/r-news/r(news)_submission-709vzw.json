Comes into my office and begins to tell me that she went to put her daughter to sleep and when she gave her a good night kiss the kid puts her tongue in the mothers mouth. Taken back, the mother ask her daughter what are you doing ? She responds, that's how daddy does it.  Asked her what else daddy does and she said \" he puts his thing in my mouth \" the kid is two years old. I lost my shit, my heart broke and was mentally fucked up for the rest of the day. Myself and other detectives were talking amongst each other and hope this guy gets thrown off a roof. \n\n\nEdit: Domestic violence officer for you asking what my job is. Also, for those of you asking what happens since it\u2019s one of those he said she said cases it\u2019s like this; an investigation is opened and everyone is interviewed then from there is the decision to move forward or not. Yes kid is two and can y\u2019all like that. I have a niece who can describe a lot of things that you wouldn\u2019t think a two year old could describe. For example my sister was giving her a bath and I put a towel on her and she said \u201c you touched my boo boob boob and kept point at it. They know more than you think. \n\nEdit: Yes, it\u2019s his biological daughter. \n\nEdit: NYPD provides therapist for anytime you feel like something is wrong or off. Not many people like talking about it because if your CO deems you a mental hazard they take your gun and shield until your psychiatrist seems you ready for full duty. ",

To the people mentioning that someone that does nothing isn't a monster but a victim, I agree and disagree. They are probably victims sure, but I'm still going to judge their choices. Choosing to look the other way is pretty bad, and this is coming from someone that's been in this sort of situation. I 100% used my body as a shield and almost died because of that choice. I would 100% do it again right now, because it was the right choice. While I guess calling everyone that makes the wrong choice a monster is a little over the top because people do shitty things sometimes, I still will judge based on your choices and doing nothing is flat out bad.",

A couple of times he would bring his daughter in to work. She was a pretty cute kid, probably about 9 or 10 or 11 years old.\n\nOne day I saw a news article about a man named Ralph who crashed his Mustang after leading police on a high speed chase after he was caught sexually assaulting a minor. I thought it was coincidence at first, but then I saw the picture of his crashed Mustang with the shitty multicolored panels and I knew it was him.\n\nWhen I came to work, my boss told me the full story that they heard from Ralph's wife, that you didn't see in the newspaper because of privacy concerns for the minor. Apparently Ralph's wife had come home a little early one day, and caught him in the act of assaulting his daughter. She immediately called the police and he fled. The police found him from a description of his vehicle and gave chase. He ran across state lines before losing control and crashing.\n\nIt was pretty surreal having known both the victim and the attacker. I would never have thought that he was the type of person to do something like that. Sometimes you just don't know what kind of people you have around you.",

I was a deputy jailer for a little over 5 years. Shit just doesn't work that way. From what I've always seen sex offenders are placed in isolated sex offfender pods. They are not placed in gen pop. In these pods you have alphas who victimize smaller weaker inmates. We do what we can in regaurds to patrol, but when I worked I would typically have to watch over roughly 170 inmates, all in 20/30 person pods by myself. \nRape happens in these sex offender pods. Big strong rapists get a fresh supply of victims and those being victimized let that rage build.\nTypically what happens is they then get out, and project that hate onto other victims\nYou fuck wits crying for an ongoing cycle of rape haven't had to save men from packs of monsters. You haven't had to fight that fight. \nYes, rape is bad, yes people deserved to be punished, but an on going rape train is not a \"fix\" it's a catalyst for future pain and suffering ",

They can all be sex offenders with their own personal preference of victim as far as sex, age, etc. but when it comes right down to it, if there is a desire to offend and a victim will be made regardless. So, the bigger, physically stronger male victimizes the smaller, weaker adult male though his sexual preference may run to adult females or pre pubescent boys.\n\nIn addition, it sheds light on just how ridiculous victim shaming and blaming is. As an example, we hear she shouldn't have worn that outfit, she shouldn't have walked there alone at night, she shouldn't have accepted a date with him or led him on or withdrawn consent after they'd started fooling around, etc. Yet, the same guy who is in for raping an adult female who may or may not have done one or more of those things, will still commit the crime against an adult male wearing prison garb.",

We where talking about fixing her car and then she stops mid conversation gets really nervous and tells me bit by bit with me asking questions. Almost had to pry it out of her.  Small town, parents would not hear of it, police station said I needed proof or her to come in and that wasn't happening. 18Yo me was passionate, angry and on a mission to fix this. I ended up holding the guy at gun point while some friends held him down and made him believe we would kill him if it ever happen again. It was not hard to convince the guy he was a loser and knew it. Once he opened his mouth it all came rolling out with the \"I didn't mean to!\" and \"I never wanted to hurt!\" BS Which was what triggered the anger in my best bro and he just started kicking till we could not kick any more.

I awoke to that creep and kicked and screamed. He ran off but in doing so knocked over a wall phone. The relentless beeping became too much after about an hour and I quietly rose up from my frozen position to place the phone back on the handle. Then I snuck into my mother's room, laid on the floor, and grabbed her hand and played 'Dumbo'. My mom used to call it that, when we'd grab hands if I was too scared to sleep as a kid. The next morning nothing hit until I went to take a shower and ran out of the bathroom screaming because my clothing/undergarments had been cut with something sharp. It *forced* me to remember. \n\nWell, my father is a fucking cop. Don't be stupid kids, but don't be an adult man that rapes a 12 year old daughter of a cop. The perp didn't even try to hide his identity. The cops came and dusted my house at likely entry points for fingerprints/evidence/etc. This guy had a record. Turns out he was (at the time) my best friend's older brother. \n\nI sat in one of those closed circuit interviews. And told what I could recall from that night. Being friendly with the cops enabled my parents to hear more of the defense arguments. That fucker actually had his MOTHER testify that I was a scandalous young whore apparently. That her son did no wrong and was only caught up in my 'web of deceit'. Me, the 12 year old. Him the 22 year old. \n\nThat asshole was rounded up and sent to prison for 20 years. He only served 8. I still remember the day I received notification he was set to be released. \n\nI hope he fucking burns in hell. ",

My friend pointed out that it started when I was seven, and a seven year old won't look exactly like their 24 year old mother. She also said that when I dyed my hair, I looked extremely different and the similarities between my mum and I were not as prominent. \n\nI think that some people may go into denial and try to block out things they don't want to admit to themselves.

You can talk about privilege until you are blue in the face, but nothing, NOTHING, cuts your feet from underneath you like a lack of family.\n\nAnd with that lack of family comes impacted education and work earning opportunity, even if you survive childhood rape free.

People don't realize how much that stuff messes you up for years. \n\nI would prefer hearing about more stabbings than parents who did nothing and stood by and let their kids deal.  Not that I totally advocate the stabbing either, really I would prefer these guys/women go to court and be labeled as evil bastards for the rest of their lives.  That's punishment enough sometimes.

Child protection hears this day in and out--it's truly a 24/7 never ending job. \n\nPeople who work with these kids down the line in facilities start off at about 12.50/hour, work holidays, and get extremely limited time off (despite self care). You get spit on, punched, run after them, love them, and care for them--usually because some POS really fucked them up and they've experienced more trauma in their pinky finger than most of us will experience in a lifetime. I know because I used to do this, and would literally have done it my whole life if I could live off of that. \n\nPolice, therapists, social workers, teachers, nurses, GALs--none of these professions get paid enough when working with children and it's absolutely impossible to comprehend what we experience (and what these kids experience in these places) unless you live it. \n\nI've been doing social work for 10 years now and have never made more that $40,000/year. I also live in a city where that's barely enough to get by. BUT, I do love working with kids. Can't wait for the day I don't live paycheck to paycheck. \n\nEdit: damn, didn't think I'd get gold ever in my life.

We sublimate it to other areas like violent video games, pornography, action movies, etc so that we can have it in a sugar coated pill form that makes it easier to swallow these things we all know exist in the primal areas of our brains.\n\nYou can even see it in some of the comments here - \"this makes me physically ill\" especially in the comment I replied to. It makes that commenter (and myself) physically ill because it is a traumatic story and most of us have empathy that causes us to also feel a portion of that trauma. What do people do *naturally* when we experience trauma? Mentally we dissociate and throw up psychological defenses to try and remove it from ourselves the best we can because that's how we protect our sanity. That's how we cope. \n\nThat's all okay, too. Without that we'd all be bashing our heads into  walls. The trick is this - we need to question ourselves and why we want to say certain things, like \"I bet she's lying.\" Why? Why do we want to say that? Sure, she could be and that'd be awful, but obviously the *most* awful situation is the one we're defending against - which is the one that results in the child being molested.\n\nSorry for the long comment.

It's not that I ever *forgot* that it happened, but I had so many walls and blocks up that it sat in the back of my mind without hurting or without me remembering the details. Then the trigger happened and all the bad came rushing forward. The memories were vivid, so vivid you could feel them. \n\nI did not deal with it very well on my own. I started drinking heavy, cutting, all sorts of out out of control self destructive behavior (except sex - that... I couldn't do that). I never told my parents, but I got help from a therapist thanks to the urging of my friends. \n\nBut whenever I've mentioned to people about the blocking things out so completely for years, I've been called a liar. A lot of people really don't believe you can experience something so traumatic that you actually can throw up mental barriers and blocks because it hurts too much to remember and relive. \n\nAlso, I hate that the word \"trigger\" in this context has been perverted the way it has.

Nevermind someone has been really damaged and needs help, the fact that it doesn't align with how we might want to see the world drives some people to deny.

Becoming a licensed foster parent varies by state and I can only speak for DC. You need to take some classes, get CPR certified, have your home inspected for safety, have a spare bedroom appropriately furnished, it needs to be inspected for fire security, no lead paint, provide references who can attest to your character, child abuse and criminal background check, etc. It usually takes a few months but that's people who are working at the same time. Here is info on DC's process, which should give a general idea: [DC Foster Parent Licensing Info](https://cfsa.dc.gov/service/become-foster-or-adoptive-parent)\n\nYou'd probably have a child placed in your home whose goal is adoption (meaning they are no longer making efforts to reunite the child with the parent). Sometimes people really want a certain child - usually a baby - and they are willing to foster one in the hopes that the parent ends up losing their rights and the child becomes available for adoption but this is a good way to get your heart broken. \n\nIt is illegal in DC to discriminate against foster parents or adoptive parents on the basis of religion, gender, marital status, sexual preference, race, political party...probably other things too but that is all I can thing of right now. The religious foster care agencies here had to go out of business because of this law. \n\nI didn't do licensure but worked with a lot of foster parents. I looked out for ones that were just in it for the paycheck. There is a stipend and it continues even post adoption until age 21 in DC (some other states are until 18, it varies). It is more than enough to cover the child's expenses and many people do this for profit. ",
