Numbers like $47,000 per year per inmate (less than many people make in a year) don't make sense when the food is disgusting, the conditions are terrible, prison is understaffed (correctional officers put their lives on the line due to this) and they're aren't many options for self improvement aside the GED, which begs the question where is all this money going? \n\nI hope this move will set a precedent, if not only start a national conversation on the topic of our flawed prison systems, and hopefully states will follow suit!",

To be a Capitalist growth of capital in any way necessary is their reason for being. This can actually be a good engine for progress if latched to the right system. \n\nSo apply this infinite growth thinking to the prison system, how does one maximize that market ethically (is this even a market?)? One would think the goal of the penal system is to minimize crime by deterrence. But as a private system that needs perpetual growth that ends up going against your goals. To achieve sustainable growth they would need sustainable crime, which brings rise to a dangerous conflict of interest. I mean it's already resulted in some horrible imbalances so I've read, regarding trumped up drug laws and targeting of black folks and other minorities due to how statistics paint them as more likely to be criminals. These things are likely to be Capitalist min-maxing applied to a system it shouldn't to maximize growth of a \"market\" we don't want to grow.",

    "body": "I'm not arguing for private prisons (because it's not just about costs), but I'll explain the idea behind having the government outsourcing things to a private organization.\n\nThe argument is about incentives and efficiency. Yes, some money is going to profit that wasn't before, but the theory is that private companies are so much more efficient than government agencies that overall costs are lower, so that it's a net win.\n\nThe idea is that private organizations have more incentives to be efficient than government does. If you are a government agency, in order to get more money, you just ask the legislature to put you in the budget. As long as you can convince them, that's all that's necessary. For a private company to get money, it has to convince customers to pay for its products/services, which means it has to convince them it can offer the product/service for cheaper than doing it in-house and cheaper than the competitors. Thus it has a natural incentive for efficiency. A private company that is wasteful and inefficient and doesn't perform well will eventually go out of business. The government won't; it will just have to ask for more money next year.\n\nWhether this actually works in practice is another question. But having worked as a private contractor at a government facility, I'm inclined to believe that it probably does sometimes. I saw civil servants (government employees) doing a lot of stupid, wasteful stuff because they just didn't care. They would do crazy stuff like take $25,000 in retired computer equipment and let it sit on a pallet in the rain to be ruined while they waited for their regularly scheduled auction, because all they cared about was following procedures for disposing of old equipment. They didn't care about getting the value out of the asset. There was a lot of dumb, wasteful bureaucracy like that. I don't blame the individual workers too much because I think the real problem is that the higher-ups didn't hold them to a higher standard because they didn't care either because they didn't need to. (I don't think all government agencies are necessarily like this, but the point is that they can be sometimes.)\n\nTo keep this fair, I should say that private organizations can also be very inefficient and ineffective on government contracts. One of the reasons the Obamacare web site sucked was they had a government contractor do it. Apparently this contractor does a lot of government work, so they were kind of a safe choice, but the fact remains that they did a terrible job.",

On top of that local jails and county facilities are frequently drunk tanks where DUIs and small time drug offenders end up for a few weeks, or holding facilities for inmates who are waiting court dates before heading to state facilities.

If the government had reclassified it to schedule 2 last week, than the FDA and drug companies would have gotten involved and it would have became a monopolized product.  I say wait till at least 40 states have allowed medical marijuana (currently at 25), and at least 15 allow recreational use (currently at 4).

The cynic says that they refused to reclassify it because of corruption and because they make money off the drug war.  Contrarily, if one were to abandon cynicism and actually read their entire public report, they say that they can't reclassify it yet because they are still working on classifying all if it's chemical components and they are about a fifth of the way there.  Also, you'll find out that the FDA made the report, send it to the HHS, and the HHS recommended that the scheduling remain the same to the DEA who simply took their advice.  The HHS also consulted a number of other departments including independent researchers and addiction study organizations.

A popular example I'm sure you can relate to is the civil forfeiture laws, or even simply speed traps. I'd also include lotteries in this. \n\nUser fees for monopolized services are easily abused by government officials, and once installed, tend to be a more politically acceptable way of increasing government revenue in general rather than increasing taxes. So in effect it often becomes a tax increase without the transparency. \n\nI'm not trying to change your mind, because it doesn't make your concerns any less valid, but simply to point out there's no panacea here. Which is why we don't have some kind of magic solution, and reasonable minds can come to different conclusions as to what's the best path. \n\nThat said, I do want to make it clear my strongest opposition to having any part of the criminal justice system being privatized. This is a welcome reversal in what has been an awful trend. I hope and pray this has a major effect on states abdicating this responsibility to private concerns as well, because the whole movement towards private prisons has been frightening to me ever since it began.

Unfortunately, in many areas, it needs to be forced upon these companies that are used to their monopolies.\n\nPrices in my area have only gone up in the past 5 years, and while speeds have changed a little, the barrier to entry is significantly higher - the lowest plan is now $45, instead of the $20 plan that existed 5 years ago (personally, I'm on neither of those, but it's concerning that the best option for someone on a very restrictive budget was eliminated entirely).",

Assuming the controlling of the cables is a new department and Congress has a majority of the Purple party (made up for this example). Congress could cut the budget of the cable department applying pressure to censor anti-Purple party media.\n\nI also worry about government controlling too many underlying technologies (like cables for internet) would stem innovation. (Why would there be a need for Fiber or for increased internet speeds if there is no threat of another company getting faster speeds?)",

I've often found it amusing (though lately, increasingly alarming) how often Americans reject various models that would encourage competition in a market - which is exactly what a capitalist should want - on the grounds of some weird (and almost religious-like) perception of capitalism that they have.

For some treatments, you will get something that is good enough rather than the best. The hepatitis C cure is a good current example. There's almost no chance that a public option would cover the cure, as it's too expensive to deliver en masse. I had a Canadian friend in college that ended up crossing the border and paying cash for procedures they didn't want to wait for, and another who had to drive like 45 minutes to see her primary care doctor because all the ones near her were no longer accepting new patients. \n\nThe other thing they do is pay doctors way less. What effect that has on the type of person who goes into medicine is up for debate. I'm in a US medical school right now, and can tell you that a lot of brilliant kids here would jump ship immediately if salaries cut in half.\n\nAlso when primary care is covered, overall costs fall because people don't wait so long to go to the doctor. From what I understand this is a major factor as well. ",

With several cable companies competing in the same local area they want to be able to offer the best possible services. The local government would want a good infrastructure to be able to recruit new companies to open offices in their town. Homeowners can increase the value of their properties. Politicians have to respond to voters.

No, it was the countryside where small towns realized they could offer a great incentive for corporations to establish themselves with lower rents and cheap high speed internet in order to create more jobs and get more people to move there.\nThe success made other towns follow suit and nowadays there's hardly any place where you don't have it.",

Computer Corporation, a closely held company in which Fred owns a majority of the stock, has submitted a proposal for the new system.\n\n>Would Fred's review of the proposals for the new library computer system present a problem? Yes.\n\n>Under the Standards of Ethical Conduct and by criminal statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 208(a), an employee is prohibited from participating personally and substantially in an official capacity in particular matters in which, to his knowledge, the employee has a financial interest. For a conflict to exist, it is not necessary that the extent of the possible gain or loss be known. The actual amount of the gain or loss is not important. However, to trigger the disqualification requirement, the matter in which the employee would otherwise participate must have a direct and predictable effect on his financial interest.\n\n[Source.](https://www.justice.gov/jmd/do-it-right)",

Since there's a variable amount of work to be done, the ideal is that as the work piles up, the frequency jumps up to take care of the work in short order, and then goes back down when there's less work to do. \n\nBut there's complicating factors. One is that the CPU can only change frequency a few number of times per second. (Relatively. I think it's still something like 100 million times, but the processor can do 3-5 billion things a second in modern computers.) So if you set demand 1 to 1, you end up trailing behind the actual workload most of the time, leading to lag. So there's other theories on how to set the processor frequency. \n\nI think the most relevant idea here is a governor that's quick to rise and slow to fall. You set it to crime statistics like you say, and if crime goes up in a given year, the budgets go up, but if crime goes down, the budgets only fall a fraction of the speed they rise. If crime stays down, the budget slowly falls to the previous number. \n\nTo be clear, these aren't relative rises and falls. Think of it more like the old linerider flash game. When there's a slope upwards, the rider goes with it to the top, but when there's a peak and fall, the linerider flies through the air, and gravity slowly takes effect, even if the slope starts to rise again below him. He only starts going up again when the slope hits him. ",
