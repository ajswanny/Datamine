    "body": "Word to the wise:  even if marijuana is \"decriminalized\" by a state, it still remains illegal Federally, which means the Fed's position is that you cannot possess firearms or ammunition.  This was emphasized on a new version of ATF Form 4473, which is the form you fill out when purchasing firearms from Federal Firearms License (FFL) holders.  Their position also applies to private sales.  Apparently, many folks are unaware of the Fed's take on this.\n\nThe new 4473 includes this:\n\n>Warning: The use or possession of marijuana remains unlawful under Federal law regardless of whether it has been legalized or decriminalized for medicinal or recreational purposes in the state where you reside.\n\nFrom http://www.thecannabist.co/2016/11/22/atf-marijuana-gun-ban/68075/ :\n\n>The federal government just doubled down on its efforts to keep guns away from cannabis patients and legal adult-use marijuana consumers.  The federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives has long had an existing ban on gun sales to anyone who uses marijuana. The ban was upheld in a controversial 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruling in August; a medical marijuana patient in Nevada said the ban violated the Second Amendment, but the 9th Circuit unanimously agreed that pot and other drug use \u201craises the risk of irrational or unpredictable behavior with which gun use should not be associated.\u201d\n\n>\u201cMarijuana is listed in the Controlled Substances Act as a Schedule I controlled substance, and there are no exceptions in Federal law for marijuana purportedly used for medical purposes, even if such use is sanctioned by State law,\u201d the letter read. \u201cTherefore, any person who uses or is addicted to marijuana, regardless of whether his or her State has passed legalization authorizing marijuana use for medicinal purposes, is an unlawful user of or addicted to a controlled substance, and is prohibited by Federal law from possessing firearms or ammunition.\u201d\n\nNOTE:  My post here is neither pro/anti-marijuana nor pro/anti-firearms.  Just being factual so folks don't get caught unaware.",

It lead me to the kitchen for snacks. Sometimes it lead me to a good a peaceful sleep. Not once after a joint or bowl or bong hit did I even THINK of another drug . I loved how at peace I was and how calm I was. Kinda like now , as I enjoy a GUINNESS and a PALL MALL cigarette; both completely unhealthy yet completely legal.

Medicinal took years to pass, solely because John Lynch (our governor at the time) opposed it. [Rumor (however unsubstantiated it may be)](http://susanthebruce.blogspot.com/2013/02/nh-house-bill-573-medical-marijuana.html) has it that he opposed it because of his wife's information (tied to the medical industry) on it. It always had a strong majority, but never quite a supermajority, so it failed until 2013.\n\nOur last governor (Maggie Hassan) essentially bent to the police lobby on drug policy. While medical marijuana in 2013 was a victory, it left a lot of drug activists very angry. She threatened to veto the bill if it had a provision allowing for patients to grow their own plants, despite supporting a less restrictive version of home growth as a state senator. She specificallly cited [concerns of law enforcement](http://www.seacoastonline.com/article/20130501/NEWS/130509991) as a reason to opposing it. For decriminalization, she said largely the  same, in between concerns about \"children getting access\" and the opiate crisis.\n\nAs you know, we have a bit of an opiate problem here in New Hampshire. Lynch was simple: he didn't want to rock the boat and piss off Big Pharma. The opiate crisis sheds light on why Hassan bowed to the police lobby. Looking \"tough on drugs\" looks good to swing voters here, especially more law-and-order types (that surprisingly do exist up here). Having some police support helps when you're going up for re-election or running against a tough incumbent for Senate (as she did both times), and the opiate crisis is a key statewide issue here. \n\ntl;dr: Lobbying from pharmaceutical companies and the police is why New Hampshire has stalled on marijuana.",
