I will use this one to repost a comment I made in the chain below here for maximum visibility. \n\n---\n\nNo. Republicans are evil. I'm calling YOU lazy ass democrats. You'll upvote and meow and prance about any issue you think you're right on, but you all don't vote. THAT'S why we have Trump right now.\nYou all need to hear this. 2018 is coming and I don't think you all are taking this seriously. Let me spell it out for you in the simplest, clearest terms:\n\nFor many of you who are younger than 40, 2018 is the single most important election of your lives.\n\nIt is your last chance to end the republican cleptocracy and give control of the republican party back to moderate, sane conservatives. It is your last chance to protect the artifices of government that make the good parts of life in America possible. What is happening politically in this country today is NOT. NORMAL. This is not business as usual. We are experiencing an ideological insurgency that is profoundly anti-humanist and it will impact literally everything. If these people are not primaried in 2018, they will install Supreme Court justices who will dictate the direction of the US for decades to come; for many of you, for the rest of your lives.\n\nMany of you are too young to have voted in a serious election like this. You weren't around during the world wars, nor for the civil rights revolution. The stakes have never been this high for you. Formative moments in national history are not common. They don't necessarily even come around once a generation.\n\nAnd this generation isn't ready for it. You are on the eve of blowing it for yourselves and your countrymen. You have one year to unfuck yourselves and learn the importance of engaging the process or you lose any remaining access to the America you were promised, along with any hope of rebuilding what was lost. You absolutely need to hear this. Fuck you all so much.",

    "body": "Comcast is asking the FCC to prohibit states from enforcing net neutrality. Net neutrality consists of the proposition that all internet traffic should be treated equally. It means that internet service providers must not be allowed permission to throttle or favor certain websites or sources by means of paid prioritization. They should also not be allowed to decide which sites should be blocked or blacklisted due to it being provided by a direct competitor of their services or of one of their subsidiaries. They must not be allowed to place a premium on websites or sources that they wish to, simply to promote themselves or someone who payed them. Passing a bill that gets rid of net neutrality may not immediately have the aforementioned ramifications, but it will present the opportunity if these companies so choose to take advantage of it. This is an action that will affect not just the people while you are in office, but will likely affect the nation for the coming decades. I strongly urge you to choose to protect the rights of American citizens and uphold the United States Constitution by not allowing corporations to silence us and decide what we can see and impede on our First Amendment.\n\nHow's this look?

You\u2019ll buck, and you won\u2019t like it. You\u2019ll ask them to stop, that you\u2019re not into it. But Spectrum wont stop, it will keep sliding it in, slowly though, with its hands on your shoulders pushing it deeper, and saying things like \u201cBut I love you\u201d, \u201cdon\u2019t you want this?\u201d, \u201cjust a little bit further baby, then it\u2019s going to feel really good, I promise\u201d, \u201cyou don\u2019t really want me to stop, right?\u201d, \u201chow does that feel now?\u201d With enough pleading, it will stop for the night, but it will express its disappointment in you. And try again tomorrow. \n\nComcast on the other hand takes a different approach. Comcast kicks open the bedroom door at three a.m. stinking like booze and cigarettes. It throws you on the bed, and rams it in raw, down to the hilt, and pounds away with a fury. Things rip and bleed. You\u2019ll scream, oh how you\u2019ll scream. But this will do nothing other than earn you a fevered punch to the base of your scull, knocking you out cold. Once you\u2019re out, surprisingly, the pounding then intensifies. In earnest this time, and with a purpose. ",

There's a limit to how many times you can tear up the road to lay fiber, a limit to how many telephone poles you can place, a limit to how many providers and house can have. It's not a free market. It's a captured market split up like blocks to drug dealers. Comcast has this hood, he has that hood, cox gets this, Verizon gets that. No competition.

    "body": "The right to lobby comes from the First Amendment. I think when most people suggest that lobbying is a problem, they are really referring to the introduction of money interests into politics. Trading money for favors is, of course, illegal.\n\n\n\nHowever, there can't be any question that Americans have the right to petition government, and the right to collectively do so. This includes corporations, some of which are formed for the specific purpose of lobbying for change.\n\n\n\nKeep in mind that lobbyists provide research and proposed legislative changes to lawmakers. At the lower levels of government, this obviously provides a very necessary service. State legislators, who are often not full time politicians, just simply need experts to come in and assist in drafting meaningful legislation to address complicated problems. For example, utility companies may want to expand some type of service to rural communities, and there may not be an existing regulatory framework for how to do that, so a lobbyist for these entities would put together a package that makes sense.\n\n\n\nAlso keep in mind that where two lobbies have rival viewpoints but relatively equal resources, it works to the benefit of the nation. The danger comes when one lobbyist group has no counter. The AARP and the Israeli lobbies have been powerful in modern US history partly because there are no counters. No association of young people, and obviously no lobby group aligned against Israel.\n\n\nThe article simply suggests that we can counter lobbying groups by providing more resources to Congress for its own in-house research. This is the solution.\n\n\n\nLobbying cuts both ways. Even the linked article notes that environmental groups had the edge over ineffective corporate lobbying in the 1970s. Increase funding for government entities to conduct research, and form lobbying groups to propose alternatives, fully supported with model legislation. But don't attempt to ban lobbying altogether. Not only does that pose constitutional issues, but it also cuts off a valuable means of informing the government about issues that you care about. ",

For example, in the town I'm currently living at, I have 3 options for a public ISP: Windstream, Spectrum, and AT&T. On paper, it looks like there is fair and balanced competition.\n\nExcept Windstream is still offering only dial up (I'm not joking, and there's a bunch of old people still using it), AT&T is offering 5mb max, and Spectrum offers 10mb upload. Because I stream 1080p quality daily, a minimum of 8mb upload is required for non-pixelated streams.\n\nWhich means, for me, there is no competition. I have one only option of Spectrum. And they are the devil. They are fucking terrible. Internet crashes like 8 times a day. I've called them so many times and even had higher up employees tell me \"Well, if you hate us so much maybe you should use a competitor's service,\" as if I have a choice. So I'm left with 2 options now: Buy another house in another city with real internet; or get a private company to set up my own personal connection for about $1300 a month. Except that $1300/month is a mortgage payment for a 3-bedroom house. So now I literally have to change my address and where I live because of an internet company being shitty. I've complained hundreds of times, I've contacted the FCC, I've threatened legal action (and still considering it), but it's all too time and money consuming it's not even worth it. I've had like several different \"technicians\" come by house, even supervisor ones, and none of them could understand why I'm frustrated that the internet crashes. They tried pulling the \"internet is a series of tubes\" thing on me, and \"sometimes it can jam up for a second or two, no big deal no one else complains about it just you.\" They tried to make me feel like I'm an entitled asshole for wanting a stable internet connection in 2017 in the Western hemisphere of the world. That's the generational gap speaking right there, people past age 40 seem to think the internet is not a need, just a leisure thing for reading emails and google. The whole western world runs on the internet, including many jobs; including mine. Fuck 'em all to hell.",

    "body": "> You mean, like they are the only ISP there? How does that work?\n\nThey are a monopoly. plain and simple. the fucked thing is that their monopoly is even government-backed in some areas.\n\nMy house can only get Comcast, and I would legitimately take *any* internet provider over them. I don't care if I'm getting a tenth of the speed.\n\nComcast royally fucked me over, I originally subscribed for a month in my old house but found out the coax ports didn't actually work, so rapidly unsubscribed, my account was deleted and with it my credit card stopped being charged. I switched back to CenturyLink who had been providing me service previously.\n\nThen six month later I get a notice from comcast saying this is my final warning for not paying my bill and claiming that they had sent me multiple previous letters warning me for my failure to pay, saying that they would send it to a collection agency if I failed to pay. So I called them to see wtf was happening, they said that I had not paid for the service I had been receiving for the past six months, service that I did not ask for, service that I had cancelled, service that I had not used a single bit of since there are no valid coax ports in my house and I'd been paying CenturyLink to provide me non-coax internet.\n\nThey escalated me a few times until finally I got to a person that actually knew what was happening, and they said that they would keep it from being sent out, but might need a few days to look into the account history and get everything resolved, they said they'd call me back when that was done. I explicitly asked them twice if it would be sent to a collection agency while that was happening, I offered to pay it outright to avoid that if it would (I didn't want to pay for service I wasn't receiving, but the amount was not that high and I figured it would be refunded when the problem was resolved) they said no, it wouldn't be sent until the active dispute was resolved, whatever.\n\nA few days later and I am looking at my credit score that has just tanked nearly a hundred points (at the time I was a college student, so my credit-history wasn't very long), I looked it up and sure enough I have a derogatory remark from a collection agency, I call them up and they say 'yeah, Comcast sent this to us' I explain the situation to them and ask what I would need to do next, they say that they can only remove it if Comcast tells them it was in error.\n\nSo I go back to comcast, who now deny seeing that I made *any* calls to them in the first place. again, whatever. I describe the basic issue again, I ask them to look in my usage logs so they can see that I have used zero bytes of data, they deny the ability to do that (which I know is absolute bullshit) and instead redirect me to another department that say they need a week to get what they need. fine, as long as it gets resolved I can wait.\n\nThe next week I call back, again get redirected to the same department, at which point the person I am now talking to says that she sees I made a call but no notes had been put in to work on  it at all. infuriating. I ask her what they need from me to get this resolved, she says they need X information, fine I go and get X-information, and call back, now they say they don't need X-information they need Y-information, okay FUCKING FINE I go and get Y-information, now they say they need a couple more days to look over Y-information and cross reference it, then a couple days later I get a call telling me this is beyond the purview of their department, and get sent to yet *another* department.\n\nThis repeats, until nearly six months have passed and the issue ***finally*** gets resolved. (the final bit of information they needed was records of me being subscribed to CenturyLink during that time, for some odd reason). but in the mean time my credit history has been fucked, I had recently got a job further out from my house than previously and I didn't have a car so I needed to get an auto loan, most places weren't willing to work with my because of my comcast-fucked credit score, so I had to go to a shady place that massively overcharged me.\n\nAfter that whole ordeal I swore to never do business with comcast ever again. Yet when I had to move into my next apartment guess fucking what? YOU DON'T GOT ANY CHOICES, BITCH! So now I am stuck either paying comcast $60 per month regardless of the fact that they fucked me over personally more than any other company I have ever dealt with, or not being able to have internet at all. Except guess what? I work in the tech industry, my job requires that I have internet access in case something goes down and they need me to deal with it rapidly, so actually I DON'T have the option of just not having internet, I HAVE to pay them money for fucking me.\n\nFuck Comcast, fuck everything they've ever done, and fuck any senator that votes in their favor on anything at all. I hope all of them go rot in hell.",

It won't be worth it for any individual person to sue, because it will cost far more than $1000 to file suit and take the case all the way through trial. The only way for anyone to seek redress is to band together as a class and file a class action seeking $1 billion in damages (or less, however you define the class). Most of the time, class actions settle, because the defendants don't want to risk a massive judgment at trial and the plaintiffs don't want to risk a defense verdict, and a settlement will obviously be for less than the maximum damages you could have obtained at trial. Then you subtract attorneys fees and expenses. So yes, each individual plaintiff receives less than the maximum damages they might be able to prove, but that's much more than the $0 they would have received had they been forced to proceed individually.",
