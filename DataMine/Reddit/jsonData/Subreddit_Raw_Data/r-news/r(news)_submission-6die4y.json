    "body": "We're seeing lots of the microscopic parasites this year.  Several companies still working on good acaricides, some in testing, some that they found also kill bees *again* that are being processed towards normal pesticides.\n\nThe best thing you can do is make sure you've got general protections around your hives... create a mild amount of climate control with screens, safe legumes, moisture availability as well as water availability that is refreshed daily.   Remember that almost all pesticides have indefinite lifespan if they're in water and not exposed to sunlight - so the smallest amount that gets into the water source will be there until consumed in one form or another. A dripping water source or beading droplet hose.  **Also remember to never use common garden hoses for anything to do with insects or fish, the antifungal manufactured into them is toxic to both.**\n\nGo to local HOA's within your flight radius and give them pamphlets on what flowers **NOT** to grow and if you get any guff get together with all the keepers in your local area and stomp on em.   Watch people with \"perfect flowers\" to make sure they're not putting any pesticides on them ever.\n\nI'm in the PC industry and I carry a couple weed tools to destroy flowers on weeds before I spray grass and don't spray soil anywhere near flower beds.  Unlike most the big companies I won't even go out to spray on windy days and whenever I can in exposed structure areas I use non-neurotoxic dusts such as Cimexa and Timbor for crawl spaces, barns and other enclosed places.\n\nFlorida can be rough on beekeeping with the large mosquito control issues this year from Zika terrors and the ever present fruit flies.  I've come across 5 wild hives forming in the last couple years and offered them to locals before I kill them.  If you don't have a hive-collecting outreach in your communities - a skillset you have! - then you should.",

Use native wildflowers if you can.\n\nEdit 2: A good read https://phys.org/news/2016-01-complex-worldwide-bee-declines.html\n\nEdit 3: I've seen lots of \"the wild bees are fine\" comments. Hundreds of species of native bees are also threatened with many facing extinction. http://www.biologicaldiversity.org/campaigns/native_pollinators/pdfs/Pollinators_in_Peril.pdf\n\"\n\n\n\u2022 Among native bee species with sufficient data to assess (1,437), more than half (749) are declining. \n\n\n\n\u2022 Nearly 1 in 4 (347 native bee species) is imperiled and at increasing risk of extinction.  \n\n\n\n\u2022 For many of the bee species lacking sufficient population data, it\u2019s likely they are also declining or at risk of extinction. Additional research is urgently needed to protect them. \n\n\n\n\u2022 A primary driver of these declines is agricultural intensification, which includes habitat destruction and pesticide use. Other major threats are climate change and urbanization\"",

Some of those companies use Permethrin based insecticides that are lethal to bees.  By law, at least in Illinois, they have to inform bee keepers within a square mile range of where they are spraying that they are putting the chemical down on vegetation so the keepers can relocate the hives.  I would request records from those companies of properties in your area that they have sprayed.  If they never informed you that they were laying pesticide down then they can get in very big trouble.\n\nMy brother started one of these companies up and it was the biggest pain in the ass contacting keepers and informing them and then waiting for them to relocate hives before we sprayed.  It got to point that my brother didn't want to deal with it anymore and sold the company because of the headaches involved with safely applying pesticides and not messing with neighboring properties.  Seriously though if you see a truck rolling around your area with big water tanks and they advertise pest or mosquito control.  wirte that number down and call them asking for records.",

The climate is changing fast, but not so fast that the population of such a hardy and cosmopolitan species would plummet that much in one year.\n\nLikewise, it's doubtful that insecticide usage increased that much in a year and even more doubtful that bees aren't quickly evolving resistances to the most common ones they experience. Bees may evolve slower than most insects, but there are still *lots* of hives.\n\nSo mites seem like the obvious culprit, or something else parasitic like a fungus or nematode.

    "body": "About 7 years, if allowed to!  Unfortunately, humans will generally terminate them after a year or two. \n\nLet me try to explain in  a brief manner:\n\nLike most of us, as the queen bee ages, she slows down her egg laying pace.   The queen's job is to lay eggs.  Every single bee in the hive is her child.  Because they slow down with age, most commercial beekeepers will re-queen each year or two.  This involves introducing a new/younger queen who will out-compete, and kill the old queen (to replace her)  OR some beekepers will squish the old queen, and drop a new one in.    They do this each season to keep the hive running at it's highest level of productivity (more bees = more honey = more money).   Interesting fact, a Queen bee will not sting you, she only uses her stinger to kill another queen (they are brutal!)\n\nBy replacing queens so often, natural selection doesn't get the chance to weed out the weaker genetics.  More importantly, it doesn't allow the strongest to survive.    A strong queen, with good genetics, one who has a hive that survives cold winters, wet springs, and whatever other adversity comes their way will pass on her genetics (by producing males who will fly out and breed with other  new queens in the area) thus spreading that strong genetic through the region they live in.\n\nInstead, commercial beekeepers order queen bees from the southern US, where they're farmed, and adapted to that climate.   Those genetics are shipped all over the US and interfere with local bee populations everywhere.  It disrupts what the bees would naturally do (breed and adapt to the place where they live over time).\n\nHumans are the problem.  The bees know what to do, and are very VERY good at their jobs (they live to work).  If left to do their job, the bees would be fine.   \n\n\n",

Just corn, wheat, and rice make up 2/3rds of the human diet.  \n\nThe $15 billion is more recent/accurate.  But while that seems big, it is out of upwards of $400 billion in crops consumed by the US.\n\nSo no, we don't rely on bees for our food production.  We rely on them for some very tasty foods, so they would certainly be missed (we could probably save those crops through other pollinators and manual pollination, but that would drive the price up).  And a lot of wild plants would die.  So losing bees would certainly be a bad thing, but not life threatening to humans.  ",

The animal control person came out, and told them that someone could come take the honeybees instead of killing them.\n\nThey gave them a few numbers of people, but they wanted substantially larger amount of money and time to take the time to transport the bees/hive unharmed than the original animal/pest control person.  Part of the issue was probably the remoteness of the property, it's miles from any paved roads (only caliche roads near there).\n\nIt's possible that perhaps beekeeper's associations or such might have done it cheaper?  However, I think they were focused on solving the issue at a reasonable cost over doing extensive research on options or regarding larger ecological considerations (reasonable given the amount of damage/repairs the house would require separate from the pest removal fees perhaps).  Another factor perhaps is the lack of internet (even by phone) to do any additional research on-site.  Makes it more practical to work on what you've been told by an expert (or \"expert\" if you prefer).\n\nThis was all in South Texas, so it's possibly they thought the bees were more likely to be Africanized than regular honeybees.\n\n[I'd seen various articles about bees having colony issues elsewhere in Texas.](http://txmg.org/resources/pollinators/the-trouble-with-bees/)\n\nThere also [organizations and resources for transporting colonies within TX.](http://txbeeinspection.tamu.edu/bee-removal/)\n\nOn the flipside, you'll find various pest/animal control companies that handle bees as pests (at least one lists bees as common seasonal pest in TX across 3/4 of the seasons in a year).\n\n...\n\nIn the end they were gassed (?), and the pest control company carted off a few truckloads of trashbags that had been filled with honey, bees, hive/honeycomb, and ruined bits of insulation/drywall.\n",

    "body": "The tracheal and varroa mites cause all sorts of issues. It can take 15-25 years for an insect to develop a resistance to treatment, and can you guess how long we've been dealing with those particular pests? :)\n\nThe whole \"1/3 of bee colonies died\" sucks, but it's not quite the end of the world that the news often makes it out to be. It's actually pretty easy to get a new hive, or dozen, going. So this *is* bad, but not \"oh God, we're all going to die\" bad. Yet. So, uhh we still need to make sure that money goes to honeybee researchers. Like a couple presidents ago when Bush, (I think) suggested closing 3 out of the 4 bee research labs and basically every state with an agriculture flipped out and was all \"would you please, PLEASE rethink that?\" We still have our 4 bee labs.\n\nWhat hurts the bee population the most is the fact that due to the 2 mites, you don't get wild swarms that survive the winter anymore, only honeybees that are cultivated make it through. In addition, it's harder for someone to be a casual beekeeper. It used to be you could have a hive in your backyard and just kind of ignore it for the most part, and that just doesn't work anymore. And with it being more difficult to keep bees successfully, less people want to go to the trouble.\n\n\nSource - My father was the Head State Apiary Inspector for the MD dept. of Agriculture for like... forever, and after that he worked at the Beltsville Federal dept. of Agriculture bee lab. We talk about bees a lot. I really ought to bug him into doing and AMA about bees/beekeeping sometime, but I'm not sure he'd go for it.",

It's applied to to last for at least a week possibly 2 depending on how much rain the area receives.  When Municipalities fog they are essentially just knocking down whatever is flying in the air.

    "body": "There are a lot of people who know this subject way better than I do, and I could be totally wrong.\n\nBut I think one of the big issues is that these hives don't so much as all die, but instead the whole colony gets up and goes for no reason ; they leave the honey, the hive doesn't have a humidity/temperature problem, a lot of the time there are no  mites.  Just as if your neighbors all get up at 2AM and walk away never to be seen again.  \n\nI don't think decoy hives catch them either (hives naturally split in half every so often, with a new queen/half the hive flying to start a new colony.  Decoy hives prevent the owner from 'losing' the bees)\n\nSo it might not be as simple as evolution fixing the issue immediately. Also, going off wiki I guess combing a weakened hive with a stronger one isn't recommended.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colony_collapse_disorder#Management",

Other industrial dairies have 'milking carousels' where the cows will literally learn to get on, get milked, and get off, when they want to be.\n\nIt's also much harder to keep an eye on animal health when you have them in pasture; though 200 head isn't much in the ranching world, that still makes it really easy to miss it when one's gone missing or has foundered on the far side of the pasture.  The ear tags are put on them for a reason.  The dairy my sister worked on monitored every single of their cows.  If their milk came back with certain markers, they knew the cow was probably sick - which means they could find her, isolate her if necessary, and give her the treatment required.  \n\nThere's arguments for both sides, especially when the larger farm is conscientious and follows regulations.

I feel bad when I accidentally kill bees (it happens all the time).\n\nSomething VERY important to consider is the fact that just because she isn't laying as fast as she used to, doesn't mean she's less valuable.  In the short term, it means she won't produce as much honey, and the farmer won't earn as much $$$ selling it.  \n\nThe queen breeds one time, when she's young, then spends the rest of her life in the hive, laying eggs.  It's the job of the workers to feed/clean/protect her.  (There's a case where she'll leave the hive with the colony, but I won't get into that now)\n\nSo she breeds once, with several males in a single session (whore!) then brings those genetics back to the hive, and every bee that's born after that is her child.  The male children (drones) have one purpose.  They leave the hive, breed with other queens, then return to the hive to eat.  The worker bees (females) will kill and dispose of the drone's bodys after they've bred. \n\nIn the long term, slow and steady wins the race.  Each year she's alive, her drones will spread her strong genetic by breeding with local queens, perpetuating the genetic in the area.   Those queens return to their hives (up to several miles away) and is combined with   the genetics of those other hives.  \n\nIf all beekeepers would let some portion of their queens live long lives like this, the local population will improve greatly.  \n\nSo there's a short term loss that beekeepers need to get used to taking, for the long term purpose of doing what's good for the bees.

For the queen to be replaced while alive the workers must first notice her insufficient egg-laying ability, which means there's an obvious risk that she may not be laying by the time the workers notice and intend to replace her. If this happens very suddenly (perhaps the beek kills her, or she is injured and cannot lay) then the current population of eggs could be larva or pupating before the workers begin supersedure. If there are no eggs left in any scenario, they simply can't make a new queen. Like I said elsewhere, lots has to go wrong for this to happen.",

My grandfather was a career farmer, I've worked on farms, there are farmers on my wife's side, etc. and the overwhelming majority of farmers where I'm from are the cheapest, greediest, most abrasively ignorant, selfish, environmentally abusive assholes who would and do willfully harm the environment for literally a couple more dollars.  \n\nI know that is harsh and it runs counter to the nationally idolized idea of what farmers are, but I promise that I don't make such claims without extensive experience. This dairy farmer in this thread though is what farmers should be, he sounds like the real deal, and dairy farmers are unique anyway. The few that I've known have been good people. But the corn/soybean/pig farmers I've known are far more common and not what people imagine farmers to be. \n\nThose people burn all of their garbage because they're too cheap to pay for a dumpster service. Drive around rural Iowa and you'll regularly see giant plumes of black smoke from farmers burning old tires rather than lay to dispose of them. They receive millions in farm subsidies and tax breaks, yet vote Republican because they don't like paying taxes for \"welfare.\" \n\nThey drive their heavy damaging equipment on roads they don't pay for because they use untaxed fuel. \n\nFuel economy is less efficient for all and food is more expensive for all because in Iowa the law requires corn ethanol be blended into gasoline. Corn ethanol uses as much if not more energy to produce energy and since its food it drives up food prices, and it's less efficient so it hurts MPGs. \n\nThey dump and spray chemicals that leach into water supplies. They have ruined countless small waterways due to greedy crop planting too close to water and through bad livestock management. I could go on and on. \n\nFarmers who care about nature and do the right thing by their livestock and society are too rare now and should be celebrated. ",
