    "body": "For those angrily [or happily] tip tap typing in their social media over Trump withdrawing from the Paris Climate Accords/Agreement, you should know that this is just a political move that will not affect the agreements. Ignoring the scientific arguments over climate change, and the actual legislation of the agreement and how effective/realistic its lofty goals are, the agreement doesn't 'start' until November of 2019. After 2019, the Paris Climate Accords state that the withdrawing of a member cannot actually start until a year after that, which is right after the 2020 Presidential Election.\n\n\nHowever, the United States could pull out of the 1992 U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change treaty [UNFCCC] as early as next year [2018]. The Paris Accords are built off this treaty that has already been ratified. A way to understand this would be to think that the UNFCCC are the objectives, and the Paris Climate Accords are a set of annual guidelines and goals to meet those objectives. The Paris Climate Accords' goals and guidelines were 'approved' by Obama via executive order [i.e not a treaty]. \n\n\nWell, the UNFCCC is a Senate-approved treaty, and good luck getting that through the Senate. You might hear today from Trump that he will pull out of the UNFCCC, with or without the Senate. If the Trump Administration was so bold [stupid] as to unilaterally pull out of the UNFCCC...well, that would be a massive violation of US Constitutional law, international laws, norms, and precedence. This would undoubtedly result in massive financial repercussions and deal an irreparable blow the the international reputation of the USA.\n\n\nAnyways, this treaty is basically pointless today, as market forces [i.e. consumers] are already driving energy efficiency and lowering emissions. Coal is less popular because gas, wind, and solar are so prolific in 2017. Sorry coal. Helloooo free market. Electric cars are booming and even my humble Kansas City's energy company KCP&L is leading the country in charging location for E-vehicles to sell underutilized energy. There are a dozen of these bad boys my work's parking lots and are usually in use. Battery technology is getting better and the cars are getting cooler.\n\n\nLast, State governments have proposed/are proposing their own plans that are even more ambitious than the Paris Climate Accords. California has a 50% energy from renewable-sources by 2030 goal and 100% by 2045 and these larger states tend to drive the future policies of smaller states. Tax-credits and government-funded retraining opportunities have made wind and solar very profitable and have generated hundreds of thousands of new, high-paying labor jobs in the US that do not require blowing up mountain tops, getting cancers, or getting policed by corrupt unions.\n\n\nTrump's move to withdraw is purely political; another inadvisable move with questionable optics to please his increasingly-shrinking base, and fulfill yet another campaign promise. The Paris Climate Accords and UNFCCC did their job: Planting the seed of industry moving to new energy sources and standards, as businesses and governments have been anticipating the treaty for decades in conjunction with increasingly-effective energy technology and demand. Don't be upset to see them go away [in 2020].\n\nSources: \n\nhttp://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2017/02/14/514517425/in-americas-heartland-a-power-company-leads-charge-for-electric-cars \n\nhttp://www.snopes.com/2017/06/01/authority-paris-agreement\n\nhttp://www.npr.org/2017/05/31/530929869/president-trump-expected-to-make-decision-on-paris-climate-accord\n\nhttp://fortune.com/2016/05/17/california-50-percent-clean-energy-goal",

Straight up BS.** UK contributed 1.8 billion alone.\n\n\n\n* (2) \"Cutting down energy prices will **boost growth**\"; **Nope. Energy costs and GDP growth has decoupled** since a decade ago. Go to your favourite broker and ask for a oil/dow chart analysis. In case no one has notice, oil is down from the peak of 80/b to now ~25/b and thats even before Trump is a thing. Theres so much oil now people are storing it in offshore bunkers not knowing what to do! So why do we need more dirty and environmentally destructive coal? To lower prices? Which magically leads to jobs? Really?\n\n\n\n* (3) \"**Biggest polluters** are India/China\". Nope again. They have the worst crisis in big cities, but by a far margin the **US burns the MOST fossil fuels** and coughs up the most CO2. Go fact check.\n\n\n\n\n* (4) \"**Disadvantages US economy** while the rest can continue polluting\". Misleading, fact of the matter is that the US polluted its way to the current superpower hedgemony. As did the other advance nations back in the day when environmental weren't a thing. The reason the US leads by committment is because (A) they were the leaders of the free world doing right things, (B) they already benefitted from the fossil fuel binge and its only fair they start cutting back first. **Your grand dads did the damage, sorry guys but you kids have to pay for it.**\n\n\n\n* (5) \"even if we cut out CO2 production now it won't budge the mercury\". This is the only half truth here. Fact is no one knows for sure. But the premise of the Paris Accord is NOT to cut now and magically save the world. It is to come to an ACCORD that this is how we should do things from now on for the future. To commit to protecting the planet. What we do in a year won't change much yes, but if we keep doing it from now on it will. **Trump just goes short term and fucks the long term.**",

You can wash out most of the CO2 gas within a coal power plant process. Afterwards you can compress it and store it. You loose some efficiency by that. \n\nThe problem is that we are not sure how we can store it for a sufficiently long time. Typically you want to compress into former oil caves that are empty after the oil extraction, or where you got natural gases from before. But if you store all the CO2 there, and 10 years later it escapes... the people around the area die and all the CO2 escapes anyway, so you could have not done it in the first place.",

    "body": "He isn't wrong. It was designed to be economically advantageous to developing countries. The theory behind it is developed countries who have gone through an industrial revolution have the resources to invest in clean energy and divest from fossil fuels. Countries like India and China who are in the middle of their industrial revolution were given a more generous time frame to divest from fossil fuels so they could catch up to the standard of living in the developed world. \n\nThe result? India ramped up solar production and [it s now cheaper than coal](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/may/10/indian-solar-power-prices-hit-record-low-undercutting-fossil-fuels) and China [built a solar array you can see from outer-fucking-space](http://www.businessinsider.com/china-solar-panels-from-space-photos-2017-2) and [doubled their solar capacity in 2016 alone](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-solar-idUSKBN15J0G7).\n\nMeanwhile people in the States are trying to bring back mining and oil/gas extraction jobs as a solution to unemployment and high poverty in rural areas instead of relying on jobs that would be created from the switch to green energy.\n\nBasically, the whole deal makes sense if you think of the developed world as having to \"de-develop.\" [Here is a link for more on that topic](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2015/sep/23/developing-poor-countries-de-develop-rich-countries-sdgs)\n\nBlah.",

    "body": "Actually this is the reason why Exxon probably pushed for the US to stay in the first place.\n\nHere's the thing. Renewable tech will win in the medium term (if it isn't winning already in various areas). If green sources, and not just solar and wind, but crazier stuff such as fusion keep going the way they are they'll beat gas and oil hands down. In many ways the tech is already mostly there, but infrastructure still has some ways to go. The thing with this tech is that once you go over the infrastructure hump, the variable costs are very close to zero, once you've recovered your investment you can keep pushing your gains to create more green plants, which results in exponential growth.\n\nGreen energy sources will win, which is bad for Exxon and such, because this will lower the demand for oil and gas greatly. The solution is obvious: grow into the markets that will replace you, so that you keep that money. The thing is that this investment costs money.\n\nExxon wants the US to stay in the Paris deal because that way they can use that sweet government money to grow into green tech. Public risk, private gains as usual.\n\nNow that the US is out of it, the rest of the world will keep investing. China, Europe, etc. will invest public money into companies and they will get better tech and out-compete US companies. This is bad for the US.\n\nA great example of how this could end for the US is many of the coal states. Montana could produce huge amounts of wind and solar power, and they are building it [privately](http://montanawindresources.com/). The thing is that govt is investing and sacrificing everything to try to keep [coal alive](https://medium.com/our-wild/what-pence-and-zinke-wont-hear-when-they-visit-montana-coal-country-e520bec73160). The joke is that coal is mostly dead, it wasn't killed but died of natural causes: technology obsolesce.\n\nThe sad thing is that Montana could recover and become a huge powerhouse by investing on green energy tech and becoming leader in this area. It probably will be beaten by states like [California](http://www.energy.ca.gov/renewables/) and will end up having to pay some of their gains on the energy they produce for others to the coastal states. The same pattern will repeat on the US.",

If half the people on here claiming to support greener energy and products, or even just hate Trump, were to start taking some of the responsibility into their own hands... things could actually change. \n\n\n\nI'm sure this will be buried, but the more people that share this idea the more it will catch on. Tell a friend, put a sticker on your car, post on facebook, tweet it out, whatever you can do to spread the message. Do some research on common products or services that don't abide to \"green standards\" and let others know, inform them of some alternatives.\n\nEdit: This exploded so quick, and larger than I would ever expected. I'm happy to know there are this many people who agree! If you updooted, I hope you spread the message! Keep up the good fight friends, you really CAN make a difference!\n\nGold? Thanks friendly stranger!  \n\n\nDouble Edit: I've read a lot of positive feedback and good ideas from a lot of you! I suggested in one comment that there should be a subreddit, focused on informing those who want change, which outs companies/products/services that reject greener practices and provide users with alternatives. I think it would REALLY catch on, I just don't know how to start something like that. If any of you are able to, PM me and I would love to help! Cheers!",

You can't claim that it has too many adverse effects to our country as a justification for pulling out while *also* saying it's unenforceable, so it shouldn't matter if we pull out.\n\nIf we stay in the agreement, then at least it *looks* like we're trying to fix the environment. If we don't, then we're just going to strain relations with 100 other countries who are trying to fix it.\n\nEdit: This blew up for some reason, so I can't respond to everyone. A lot of people are focusing on my second paragraph here. I probably didn't convey my thoughts correctly.\n\nFirst of all, yes, agreeing to the deal and not doing *anything* is definitely bad for optics. That wasn't what I meant here. If we go with this deal, start working towards green energy, but end up seeing clear negative impacts in our economy and pull out, at least we would have made an attempt. It would have shown the world that we are serious about Climate Change and want to stop it. Conversely, if Trump wants to come up with an actual revision to the agreement that works towards green energy in a different way, I'll be for that too.\n\nHowever, what we need to do is stop making excuses for why we aren't joining. The fact is, Trump has been very vocal about his stance on Climate Change. He doesn't believe in it. He wants to subsidize coal, and he wants to cut the EPA, etc. Let's stop pretending that he is against this deal because it's bad in execution, he's against this deal because he's against the notion of Climate Change.\n\nMost of these excuses like \"it doesn't have teeth\" and \"it's bad for America\" imply that the deal is bad, but the intent is good. All of these can be countered with this: what other solution towards green energy is there? If Trump could actually provide a plan, then it has the same effect of joining the Paris Agreement; it shows we're serious about this issue. I'd much rather be working towards *something* than to hear this administration simply say \"this deal is stupid, so we're going back to coal\".",

Basically you are describing a union of consumers, effectively creating singular demand. \n\nThis would, if it works on the short term, create a decrease in demand for low-cost goods that pollute. These goods, mind you, are artificially low-cost; that is, they externalize costs because other people pay the price of pollution (you pay it when you buy asthma medication, the fisherman pay it when they lose revenue due to dead fish, society pays it when the price of fish increases, homeowners pay it when their home value decreases near the plant, etc). \n\nConsumers lowering demand for these goods will further lower their price. This incentivizes consumers to break the embargo against them, and eventually said embargo will indeed break. \n\nPeople respond to incentives. I'll say it again: people respond to incentives.\n\nIf there is an incentive, people respond to it. Here, the disparity in prices will be too much. The polluter will be doubly cheap: lower demand lowers the price, and their externalizing costs lowers the price.\n\nPeople will be drawn by this incentive to consume the polluters good until an equilibrium is reached. \n\nThis is why the necessary solution is to force them to raise their price to the approximate value of the aforementioned externalized costs. To make them cover all of the hidden costs associated with polluting (or, to not pollute).\n\nThis is done with law. Law is the mechanism whereby we organize our society. This law might be an increase in taxes, it might be a cap-and-trade, it might be a quota, whatever. But the important element of law is that it has the force of guns behind it, at its essence. If you pollute, you pay, and if you don't pay, we will take your money anyway. And you can't stop us (literally) because we can physically overwhelm you. \n\nThere is a point where economics ends and other elements of society begin, and external costs is one of those points. You need to *force* people to pay their fair share -- otherwise they won't! Why would they? People respond to incentives.\n\n",

Meaning that, either way, we should be striving to perfect vaccine and renewable technologies purely out of a sense of responsibility and prevention. \n\nAt no point in history has investing in new and upcoming technologies been harmful for the economy in the long term, so that argument is bogus. \n\nAnd though I know it, and the mainstream evangelical system for it, she hit me with the only argument they can muster, which amounted to \u201cwhen you grow up, you\u2019ll realize you\u2019ve been brainwashed\u201d.\n\nNow, in a way, I can understand her reaction: I\u2019m just a young friend who posted a long and passionate post on an article she shared pointedly calling her, and many conservatives, out. And, frankly, she is one of the most polite people I\u2019ve ever met, and she is an absolute joy to song with and be around in choir (an older woman).\n\nBut her reaction really demonstrates the kind of people we, as a nation, are dealing with. Essentially, they do not believe in the world they live in. They misinterpret the Bible\u2019s teaching that Satan is the ruler of this material world to mean that any piece of information that comes from a non Christian source is nothing but liberal propaganda, reasoning and logic be damned. \n\nI\u2019ll admit, it gets to me. I graduated with a bachelor\u2019s in electrical engineering, and I\u2019m passionate about anything related to science, technology, medicine, etc (basically knowledge and learning). When I find something interesting, I immerse myself and devour the topic from the inside out. And, at times, it feels like a personal affront to me, and a slap in the face to all the people in my field. \n\nI will be a Christian until the day I die (I hope), and I strongly believe God gave me a brian to use in this magnificent world he put me in. I don\u2019t see science as a conflicting with my faith at all, but as a supplement. \n\nAnd just because I\u2019m young doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m not capable of understanding the world around me in new and amazing ways. It was a bit hurtful to be outright told I\u2019ve been brainwashed simply for applying basic logic to the world around me and constantly seeking to inform myself of the way the world works. \n\nAnd it\u2019s painful to have so many people, of my one faith no less, insisting that everyone in my field, and everyone in medicine, are exposing ourselves to dangerous materials and diseases in our attempts to leave the world a little better than the found it. I can understand that some are in it for the money, but all of us? When I saw the kind of amazing and intelligent people in my graduating class taking about wanting to develop better prosthesis, advance renewable energy technology, help disabled children, or fulfill a promise made to a dead family member?\n\nI\u2019ll be the first christian to apologize for the garbage logic the mainstream evangelical system has vomited in the world, and the united states in general. You all deserved out best, but instead the mainstream face continues to affirm the worst. ",
