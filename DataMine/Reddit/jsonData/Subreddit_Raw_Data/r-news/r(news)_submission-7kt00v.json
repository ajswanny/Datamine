My band was starting to get international attention, I was playing out of town and I have a beautiful, supportive partner.\nBut then she made an anonymous call-out post about me, saying I had spent all those years violently raping and hitting her and sent it to hundreds of people.\nIn this environment no one would dare question her, so I've lost everything. I lost my band, I don't have a job, and most of my friends who tried to stick by me were publicly branded \"rape apologists\" so I've lost them too.\nMy life was amazing just a few months ago and now it's in shambles, and though my friends know the truth, no one will stand up for me out of fear of retaliation.\nMy girlfriend has been wonderful and has also stuck by my side, but my ex's friends have made her life a living hell as a result. They're trying to convince everyone that I am also abusive to her, including by contacting her work place which was humiliating for her.\nI've always considered myself an ally to feminism and the #metoo movement.\nAll it took was an email and my abuser quickly turned into my victim, and no one seems to care about all the evidence (photos, texts, witnesses) I have that she was very violent with me.\nIt's very sad to be thrown completely under the bus when you don't further the narrative.\n\nEDIT: Thanks for the gold, and for all the support I've received here. It's a daily struggle to wake up and remember that the amazing life I was just living is over, but all the encouragement here has me feeling a bit more motivated to keep gathering evidence and continue to fight this.

There is actually more to this confession but it's hard to anomolize it.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/p7q90\n\nThat didn't stop a false rape fantasy story to be spread through the dorms and is regularly read by this group of students in public.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/jYmFC\n\nSome students, believing the rumors in ernest, have begun stalking me and keeping tabs on me around campus\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/nUFj3\n\nAfter speaking out about this and how my ex sexually assaulted me, I found out that some people harbored violent fantasies about me and how I should be dealt with.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/olMl9\n\nI attempted to get the university's administration to do something about this, but instead they assured the other students they would not be in serious trouble.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/lr8Q7\n\nI was also coerced our of my private lease agreement near school by the administration and have been homeless ever since.

It will be nearly impossible to continue school and I am psychologically and physically broken.\n\nIt does not matter if you have all of the evidence to prove that you are innocent and are indeed the victim.  If you are a man, everyone believes the accuser.  Your life could be over like that.\n\nMy life is probably over.  I don't think any of my dreams are going to come true.

It's a crime just about everywhere to make a false statement to the police, and she did exactly that. Society should prosecute false allegations with impunity because you are essentially trying to ruin someone's life and abuse the system as a tool to do it. \n\nAlso, if people feel like they can get away with making false allegations, they will do it more often, and this makes real allegations seem less legitimate. You wonder why police sometimes don't believe a victim, and this is why. They did a study on rapes reported in a university, and they found that about 5% of the reports were PROVEN to be false after investigating (even getting the accuser to confess the charges were made up in most cases), and another 30% were never escalated because they were either believed to be false or there wasn't enough reliable information to really do anything with it. (let's guess that 1 in 6 of those were also false) When an officer knows that statistically ~10% of the cases brought to him are going to be made up, he should act skeptical and question all the details of a victim's story. This isn't him \"not believing you\". It's him doing his job, and we could make this situation better by punishing proven false accusations severely. ",

But if you have sex 12 times and after each time you tell everyone it was great and you instigate the next encounter over and over again, with not a single word about rape, forced, being scared, etc, then after them all you claim they were all rape...... well, you're straight up lying.\n\nIt's also believable to have sex, be raped and lie to your friends because you want to hide it. So you text friends saying it was great while really balling up at home in bed crying and trying to get over it. But in that case, you don't keep texting the rapist to ask them to fuck you again and again.\n\nBasically those texts paint a picture in which she was clearly consenting, instigating and telling everyone it was great, then at some later date decided fuck you I'm going to ruin your life.\n\nIt would take a cop 10 mins to put together the supposed dates of the rapes, see the history of her communication and know she was lying yet he spent 2 years with this evidence being hidden while his life was being ruined with his name broadcast all over papers. also don't forget that during this two years the lawyer repeatedly asked for the evidence and was refused over and over again.

The police promptly arrested him then sent him home. They ignored calls that there were people outside the guys house, they sent a community officer to 'patrol' the area who lied about spending an hour walking around. Two guys together grabbed the guy, stamped on his head and set him on fire.\n\nTwo of the cops did jail time, another several were fired. In the US as you say it would have been some money to the family and some paid leave for the cop or maybe quitting and then getting a job in a different department in another city or state.\n\nThey cop(s) who fucked this one up should get fired, they let a guy twist in the wind for two years while sitting on definitive proof he was innocent. Frankly in these cases checking texts/social media for both sides around the time of an alleged incident should pretty much be the first thing they do as plenty of people are dumb enough to incriminate themselves. Had they done so they could have dismissed this long before it ever got to charges or releasing the guys name.\n\nI've seen multiple posts on UK forums in which a huge portion of people don't really understand exactly what happened and still don't believe he's innocent... that will basically follow him around for life now.

When he rebuffed her advances, she got pissed and her \u201cmemory of things\u201d started to change. She made up a story about him stalking her and taking advantage of her, and filed a police report accusing him of sexual assault. Nearly derailed this young man\u2019s football career and got him kicked out of school because she was mad at him. \n\nThis all went down in the past couple weeks. The allegations were so serious, and the evidence contradicting her story were so strong, that the district attorney held a press conference last week to debunk her story and explain why they would not be prosecuting Mr. Anderson. She has since dismissed her request for a victim protective order.  \n\nWatch the video of the district attorney\u2019s press conference or read some of the stories. Her behavior in this was appalling. Anderson was lucky he could have a decent lawyer (and that he is a high profile person) so that a thorough investigation was conducted.

Tells her friends about it, they shame her, she switches the story up to she really didn\u2019t want to, friends call campus pd and they call local cops who come to our apartment and tear his shit up and take his dog to the pound. College sends mass email to every student with the kids name and how he is accused of rape. Local news has a story about it and bam 2 weeks later the video comes out that one of kids took showing it was consensual and then we never heard about it again.

THAT guy shouting should get some time as well, he created an incredibly tense atmosphere needlessly. I just don't see why when he's on his knees at the end of the hallway and has his hands in the air they don't slowly approach him and cuff him. Making him crawl makes his hand movements so much more ambiguous. They should be in prison for manslaughter at least. Fuck.",

I know of *at least* one guy who was \"doing his degree\" for the entire duration of my time at my university.

Good on him.\n\nEdit: I won\u2019t change my original comment for reference sake. With that said, I\u2019ve consider all of your feedback, thank you. It seems that the true highest road, in this case, would be for the gentleman accused to make a sort of example out of this woman to prevent this type of thing from happening again. Her actions are reprehensible. All in all, I commend this gentleman for taking up a lawsuit against the justice system, it brings attention to the type of negligence that occurs in the justice system. My sentiment remains, good on him.",

Man b reaches behind his desk for a club and the legally carrying man pulled his weapon. The situation de-escalated very quickly and after legally carrying man left, man b calls the police. They go to his home, arrest him and he is prosecuted.\n\nThe prosecution continued to make a big deal out of the fact that legally carrying man pulled his weapon. Their explanation of man b pulling the club out (which he admitted in court that he did this prior to any threats from legally carrying man) was that he did this all the time when he was nervous or agitated. To me that sounded like the most bogus story ever and yet the prosecutors were trying to send legally carrying man away for a 3-5 stretch.\n\nOnce in the jury room a vote was taken and it was 10-2 to CONVICT... my thought was wtf??? One other lady agreed with me and we had to explain ourselves to the other 10. Their biggest arguments against legally carrying man  was he wouldn't have been arrested or prosecuted if he wasn't probably guilty and the other was he looked like a thug. No shit. They were going to send him off because of how he looked and they trusted the \"system\"\n\nHowever, they willingly changed their votes after a short bit of reason and it became obvious the 2 of us weren't changing our minds. These good folks couldn't be bothered with this silly jury stuff when they really needed to get home before supper...\n\nI won't bore you with the details of the other but it involved a lady who had her drink spiked but left the bar as soon as she realized something was wrong and then was stopped as she got into her car and was arrested for drunk driving. She had proof and the prosecutors had nothing and still this jury (different than the one above) was willing to convict her because she had been in a bar and would have been drunk had she not left early....smh\n\nI wish i was making those stories up but I'm not.\n\nAfter the first one and the thug comments, as soon as i got home i relayed the same advice Brian Setzer's (The Stray Cats) dad gave him. Get all the tattoos you want just make sure to put them where the judge can't see them. \n\nOf course the jury doesn't need to see them either....",

She should be on the hook for perjury or similar already. Only reasonable explanation I can gin up is that they're still building the case against her. The standard of evidence needed to exonerate someone is generally lower than what's needed to successfully convict someone. Since they can't try her for her crimes twice, they may be biding their time to ensure her crazy ass gets put away for a long time.",
