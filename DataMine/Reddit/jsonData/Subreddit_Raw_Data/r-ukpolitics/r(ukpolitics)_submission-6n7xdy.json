    "body": "Yeah if you are poor in the U.S. you might not have access to some aspects of preventative medicines. Elective procedures which are defined differently between hospitals. And sometimes high cost processes such as chemo or complicated brain surgery. But you get emergency care, and your costs are usually thrown out because it's allotted in the operating budget.\n\nThe problem comes in when people make bad life choices like smoking, drinking in excess, and consuming fatty foods for 40 years and expect to get treatment for resulting conditions with no insurance or basic coverage. Why would you, from the standpoint of a hospital choose to treat someone like this over someone with an emergency condition or someone who didn't bring it on themselves. \n\nThat is the fundamental reason a lot of people are against government funded Healthcare, because some people who pay no taxes into the system make bad choices and expect it take care of them. Also people don't want to pay for the bad choices and mistakes of others and receive the same level of care when they go to the hospital and find out they have cancer even though they never smoked, drank, or ate poorly. Imagine that, you go to the the hospital and sitting next to you in the courtyard is another man who is receiving the same treatment for cancer inside and is outside smoking a cigarette.\n\nPeople like to say that the NHS is more fair than the US system, but for who? I think it's fair to reap what you sow over 40 years at the expense of your own health and money than tax payer funded hospitals and clinics. Education is a more sustainable strategy than providing the same level of care to individuals regardless of what they did to precipitate their own condition.",

    "body": "Here's how the US system is setup. I've been on the federal program for almost 20 years so I'm familiar with the nuance.\n\nMedicare is the federal program which provides health insurance to the elderly, disabled and extremely poor. It provides 60% of qualified medical expenses and the premium is $107 per month. What counts as qualified is always in question and you have to be completely insane to understand it. Medicaid is the state funded insurance. It typically covers the Medicare premium and the difference of what Medicare doesn't pay. If you change states your Medicare follows but you have to reapply for Medicaid and you may not qualify depending on how the state structures their program.\n\nMedicare covers diabetic testing equipment, but not testing strips. It covers yearly eye exams but only covers prescriptions every other year and usually you have to fight to get them to pay. It covers yearly dental check ups as well as fillings and extractions, but nothing else since any other dental work is considered cosmetic. Medicare isn't taken by most doctors because they have a habit of not actually paying the bill.\n\nThe ACA (Obama Care) allowed more people to qualify for Medicare and to fund it instituted a fine against anyone who didn't have private insurance even if that person was out of work at no fault of their own. It is basically a tax on the poor to in theory help provide horrible insurance to the poor.",

Yes, it is free in theory, but when it comes to Cancer treatment and heart operations.\nb.  I would rather have a college level debt and be alive.\n\nHere are some reasons:\n\n- Doctors in the USA have no caps on earnings. The best from around the world move to the USA for the money.\n\n-  Technology - Specialization is a major factor. The UK has Universal Care. Finding a specialist takes time and you have to wait.\n\n- Payment -  The system does not reward performance. Many doctors move to the USA and end up earning based on their ability.\n\nIn Closing.

The US will often use the latest fancy gadgets or drugs at very inflated prices, improving the outcomes for *individuals*. The UK on the other hand will ask if deploying the gadget will benefit the *population* (i.e. what benefit it might have for the average patient who would get to use it).

    "body": "I live in America. I've been without healthcare before. What not having healthcare in the US means is that every time something devastating happens to your body, you have to weigh up, \"can I survive this without help?\" I know people who have had broken arms who would make crude slings and keep them there for a few months because, while they could see a doctor, they knew that doing so would bankrupt them. This was a 20 year old just trying to keep his feet on the ground.\n\nI once saw a friend faint and so I called the ambulance. When he became conscious , they suggested that he should be taken back with them to the hospital because clearly something wasn't right. He said no, because the ride in the ambulance alone would be more than he could afford. \n\nI personally have asthma, and with my current insurance it costs me $50 per preventative inhaler that lasts me 45 days. Without insurance, it costs $385. Which means that when I didn't have insurance, I didn't have preventatives. It costs me $25 for a rescue inhaler with insurance, I can't remember what it is without, but I couldn't afford it. So when I had an asthma attack, I would sit down or lie down, and take deep breaths until it passed. \n\nOne day I had back pain that was so bad that I couldn't lie down without being in agony. I went to the emergency room. They eventually gave me an MRI and an injection. I was there for maybe 3 hours. The bill, after insurance, was $700. \n\nIn the US, if you have a well paying job, these costs aren't going to kill you so long as you have insurance. But if you're a college student like I am, that cost is going on a credit card (if I have one) and I'll end up paying 20% interest from that because I don't have $700 lying around every time I have an emergency. So even with insurance, I still have to consider whether I really need to go to the emergency room or not, or the doctor or not, or if I really need that $120 medication (like the eye drops I got a few months ago) or not. Don't get me wrong, I'm not poor and I have insurance, but these days, my generation doesn't have thousands of dollars saved up they can throw at bills at any time. ",

My health insurance paid overall 75% or so. So your 30 minute procedure cost $1,400. Was it worth it? Maybe, but theres a lot of people who dont have $1,400 sitting around.

However, countless research has shown that deductible and premium would have gone much higher without Obamacare - of course, there is no way to verify this.\n\nHowever, even if deductible is increasing with ACA, is it not better to have everything covered than juggle the mix about having some things considered. What about annual physical - which should run at least $1000 / person in our for profit health system. What about access to contraceptive for women who wants to use them. I believe this should run around $800 per year based on recent Walgreens bill. Even if you wont use those, isnt is better to knowing that whatever medical condition you have will be covered by insurance and they will not find a way to weasel out.\n\nMy uncle was paying $800 per month for his and wife's insurance and his long list of medical conditions such as blood pressure, cholesterol, arm being removed from socket (no idea of technical word) etc. were not covered. Even doctors visit related to those issues were not covered. Now, he is paying $1400 for himself, wife and 1 kid and all these issues are covered. In this case, saving could range as low as $200 per year (just generic cholesterol medicine) to $70,000 (in case of a stroke due to his cholesterol). \n\nThe current system is obviously flawed. Instead of paying $16,000 per year to some middle man, the government should just increase taxes and provide those services like any sane developed country does but without that, ACA has made things much better than what we previously had.

Although the federal government will pay for the expansion, many governors cited cost, even though the expansion would actually save money. America is unique among developed countries in that tens of thousands of poor Americans die because they lack health insurance, even while we spend more than twice as much of our GDP on healthcare than the average for the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), a collection of rich world countries. The U.S. has an infant mortality rate that dwarfs comparable nations, as well as the highest teenage-pregnancy rate in the developed world, largely because of the politically-motivated unavailability of contraception in many areas.",

On what planet? You can get a physical from a doctor for under $100 with no insurance. Women can also get birth control for $9 a month without insurance. I've paid for birth control for every woman I have ever been in a relationship with and it has never been over $20 a month. \n\nCan you tell me which doctor charged less than $100 for medical with complete blood work, ECG etc. I am not talking about a regular height/weight check but all the bloodwork etc associated with it. If its $100, then I am sure a lot of people will like to know what that.\n\nSo $9/month without insurance is from family planning groups not from a pharmacy. With all the efforts to defund Planned Parenthood etc, I dont think it is sustainable. Plus, I can get my hospital fee waived due to hardship, it doesnt mean that I could say hospital is free. \n\n>With public, the government is the middle man and now you have a huge government program to fund. \n\nIt does eliminate the middle man as right now, the insurance company is the go-between from consumer, doctor and the government. Remember that government is paying a subsidy to insurance company. Pre ACA, this was for Medicare/Medicaid and now it is for those two and Marketplace insurance. \n\nWhat it will also eliminate is a lot of profit motive for insurance companies as they have to make a profit and also, the effort people spend to find an in network doctor and all the other crap that comes with it.\n\nWhen you say Government program to fund, how do you think government pays for it? Through taxes? And the chemist in your example is the person who pays the taxes. Paying Government will be cheaper in the long run than paying a private company. The problem is, someone is paying for the insurance. We just dont like the word 'taxes' so happily pay an insurance company for the same thing the government could provide. \n\nAnd, just because your employer pays for insurance doesnt mean you do not pay. Your employer can easily increase your salary by $15k (insurance cost for example) and ask you to pay Uncle Sam directly. The benefit component of health care (as with any other benefit), is built in your salary component. ",

    "body": "Your sources show individual insurance plans being lower after the ACA which makes sense, since the ACA subsidized individual plans. \n\n[Group plans however went up](https://www.forbes.com/sites/theapothecary/2017/03/22/yes-it-was-the-affordable-care-act-that-increased-premiums/) \n\nGo to my doctor or my son's doctor where physicals are under $100. Blood work is done at labs, that's obviously going to be a different cost as it is for insured people. My blood work is $40. My doctor does EKGs so he can charge for them but under 50 with no existing heart condition? No need for an EKG and if your doctor does this, they are \"padding\" your bill. \n\nGo to Walmart, extremely cheap birth control without insurance. \n\nNo.... It really doesn't eliminate the middle man. The government would take the place of the insurance company to verify the need for services provided. IDK how anyone can not grasp this. A new government agency would be created for overseeing \"single payer.\" \n\nThis has nothing to do with people not liking the word \"taxes.\" Nobody likes playing taxes, everyone does everything possible to pay less. Anyone that says they don't mind paying taxes either isn't paying 50% of their income to taxes like most of middle America, or they are lying. \n\nThe US already has massive government insurance programs that are expensive and inefficient. \n\nMedicare which forces people to choose between their medications or eating.\n\nMedicaid which clogs up our emergency systems. Plus overlooks people in genuine need over people who want to play the system.\n\nThe VA, which has killed more of my friends than the Taliban. ",

    "body": "Obesity is a healthcare issue though. Healthcare systems around the world are increasingly looking to prophetically dealing with such issues through dietary recommendations before people become too fat. A healthcare system that treats problems before they become problems is a valid healthcare system.\n\nAlso, you conflate two separate things. You argue that the US has great healthcare because a rich minority has access to excellent healthcare but then compare that to the healthcare values for countries that give great healthcare to (nearly all) their population.\n\nInfant mortality rates in the US aren't statistically insignificant. They are worse than the rest of the developed world by a wide margin, that is the definition of significance. The insignificant bit is the quality of healthcare afforded to a rich minority (which is actually quite a small minority as even many people in the US who consider themselves affluent actually get worse healthcare than the majority of people in other developed countries).\n\nThe US certainly has the potential to have the best healthcare system in the world - it probably has the best medical expertise, I doubt anyone would argue that, however the systemic problems within the US system turn what could be the best into the worst in the developed world. It's the difference between \"potential healthcare\" and a \"healthcare system\".",
