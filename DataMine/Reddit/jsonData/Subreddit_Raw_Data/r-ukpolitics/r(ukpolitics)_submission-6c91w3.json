He did a good TV show on school dinners in European countries, although admittedly I've only ever watched one episode. He was in a town in Italy, where the local authority pays 90p per day per child, compared to (iirc) ~30p in the UK. The Italians weren't just providing nutritious meals either; they were educating the children on the importance of nutrition too. Whatever our thoughts are on Theresa May's plans, we shouldn't underestimate the importance of providing nutritious, healthy dinners to children. And if meals are provided for free across the board, then that can can only be a good thing.",

    "body": "Jamie Oliver is selfish. If he cared about nutrition he'd scrap fizzy drinks from his restaurants instead of charging even more and making money out of it. This is all him being self-serving. \n\nScrapping free lunches I don't really have an opinion on, and while the principle is good, back when I was in school it tasted like crap and so I never had it. School would actually try to force me once, so I sat in the dinner hall for the entire hour and didn't eat it. Why did it taste like crap? Because it was so badly funded. I'm sure at one point, prisoners had more spent on food than kids.\n\nHigh School was slightly better, at least at one of the high schools I went to, though I just ate pizzas, tiger bars and cans of pepsi. The second high school I'd go to the shop to buy my own before school, usually a pasty, or pay the underground dinner crew who would sneak out at dinner hours to provide kids with staffie oatcakes.\n\nFree school meals or breakfast club is good if it is well funded and the kids can enjoy it. There is a stigma amongst kids who are on free meals and chances are, unless the parents are truly desperate they won't take it.\n\nCooking etc is a pain in general, but cheering on Jamie Oliver as some kind of social champion given his backward attitudes towards the working class, and his ridiculous, expensive recipes - he can do one.\n\nIf it were me - yes, fund free lunches if they are actually good; not just on the principle. Otherwise, better let the parents sort their own kids out. There is an argument that having the state provide for their children then parents won't bother with their kids at all... you have to draw a line and the responsibility should fall on the parents not the schools.",

If you however can make a meal with a small number of ingredients which works for 2-3 days worth of meals, and the ingredients then work in another recipe, you are getting somewhere. Even something as basic as a chicken - you can literally buy a whole one for less than a bag of frozen chicken nuggets. Roast that up, shred it and you have the basis for several days' worth of meals. \n\nEffort is what it comes down to.

The only reason I can see that they'd be doing that is to save a bit of money, and why would the tories be targetting school kids to save a bit of money 8/9 years after a recession? Either their economic recovery was an absolute failure, and they need to try skimp a couple quid off the lunches of school children (i'll admit it is a massively amplified policy in the media, but it's good for making the point I'm trying to make), and will give them breakfasts knowing that fewer children will have them, or the recovery worked just fine and we are back to being the 5th biggest economy in the world and have all the spending power, but would rather stick with austerity, and genuinely the only reason you'd stick with austerity is because it suits big business better. Just look at how [austerity works out for the rich](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/apr/26/recession-rich-britains-wealthiest-double-net-worth-since-crisis) and how it's [worked for the poor](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/britains-divided-decade-the-rich-are-64-richer-than-before-the-recession-while-the-poor-are-57-10097038.html).

My school did, plenty of kids went.\n\nI did not. Quite jealous though.\n\n>Yes that is their goal, to be honest they just want to kill the poor.\n\nHey, no one's said they want to *kill* the poor. Dead people are pretty useless. They just clearly think that the money trickles down fast enough that you don't need public investment if the private sector is wealthy enough, and as a result and they don't mind if [people are dying](http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/social-care-scandal-tory-cuts-9836261).

They've had 9 years to put their economic recovery plan to work, and what have we to show for it? \n[Britain's divided decade: the rich are 64% richer than before the recession, while the poor are 57% poorer](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/britains-divided-decade-the-rich-are-64-richer-than-before-the-recession-while-the-poor-are-57-10097038.html) according to the independant. The recovery has hit the richest disproportionately. Do you think that's an accident? Or do you just agree that trickle-down economics works? \n\nWhat's the point of having a thriving private sector if the public sector is still facing spending cuts in a period of supposed economic growth. Is there a recession or not? If yes, tories economic recovery plan is broken and they should be voted out. If no, then continued austerity is genuinely just for assisting the private sector at the expense of the british public. Both mean they should be voted out. Austerity is a direct attack on the british people.\n\nMy point you missed about the school lunches was that less students will be at school before class time in order to get their free breakfasts than will be there at lunch. Therefore it seems to be an attempt to save money. Why save money if we aren't deep in a recession? (one that was started because of the neo-liberal tendancy toward financial deregulation anyway). But I take your point about some kids being able to get 2/3 meals free. I hadn't thought of it like that before. Doesn't justify it to me though really.\n\nWe are the 5th richest economy in the world but somehow we can't afford to pay our nurses, police officers or firemen. How can that be? A deliberate choice by Tories who would rather just not spend money in the public sector\n\nTL;DR they've been encouraging businesses to thrive for 9 years now and they're still cutting public services. We are a \"prosperous country\" already and they still aren't trying to serve the people anything except [fit for work notices](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/nov/24/fit-for-work-sick-disabled-people-death-collateral-damage)",

Thumping the ball carrier, or those tackling him, on the body was considered part of it (perhaps partly why it was *always* a him). There was no out of bounds it's just nobody wanted to go in the nettles or be taken down on the tarmac instead of the grass. There was no concept of cheating, it's just that if you went too far hits to the face ect it would end up in a fight.\n\nProbably a bad spectator sport but was the shit, it's amazing this was played for years at that school. It was banned from time to time but most staff I imagine just saw it as \"things getting out of hand\" not a game in its own right and soon banning ball sports seemed an over reaction and they forgot all about enforcing it.

It also makes for longer waiting times and fewer resources when *you* need care.\n\nIt also costs employers more in taxes and lower productivity, as obese people get sick more / statistically have several more health problems than non-obese people.\n\nBasically, it creates multiple drags on the economy and is a public health disaster.\n\nOf course, it's horrifying to contemplate the government outright banning certain foods in true nanny-state fashion. But it's totally reasonable to put a few pressures on bad behaviors (defined here as having wide-ranging negative impacts on everyone else). Governments do control what foods kids are exposed to in the educational system, at least for public schools. Since kids develop a lot of their adult eating habits in childhood, it's a small short-term restriction on a very minor freedom (of kids to eat crap at school) for some very large long-term gains. \n\nSame for taxing severely unhealthy foods; it's easy to argue that it's simply asking people that use these products more to pay their fair share of the impact they're having on everyone else's taxes by their behavior. I mean, someone *is* going to have to pay for Johnny Fatboy's unhealthy lifestyle, and I work in healthcare finance, so I can tell you... Unless he is insanely rich, there's no way in hell that just his income taxes are covering his additional costs, so you and I are actively subsidizing his junk food addiction.

Which we should attempt to wind in so that we dip back into it when the next recession comes around. What's more is I would personally quite like to keep tax low, I already see a good deal of my pay check get hovered up to tax and I don't even earn all that much.\n",

Britain's divided decade: the rich are 64% richer than before the recession, while the poor are 57% poorer according to the independant. The recovery has hit the richest disproportionately. Do you think that's an accident? Or do you just agree that trickle-down economics works? \n\nThey've had two and a half and most of that was taken up with Brexit referendum.\n\n>What's the point of having a thriving private sector if the public sector is still facing spending cuts in a period of supposed economic growth. Is there a recession or not? If yes, tories economic recovery plan is broken and they should be voted out. If no, then continued austerity is genuinely just for assisting the private sector at the expense of the british public. Both mean they should be voted out. Austerity is a direct attack on the british people.\n\nHard not to have austerity when there is no money to spend and the debts are already sky high. Normally you save and invest during the good times so you can spend and borrow during the bad but Labour didn't do that leaving nothing and massive debts when the bad times hit.\n\nAlso there is still economic growth despite constant warning of a recession before and after Brexit.\n\n>Therefore it seems to be an attempt to save money. Why save money if we aren't deep in a recession?\n\nTo make sure we don't go into one? Seriously this is pretty basic stuff even Miliband had to admit in the last election he would have to make the same level of cuts as the Tories.",

How about the Guardian saying that [the richest 1000 families have doubled their networth](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/apr/26/recession-rich-britains-wealthiest-double-net-worth-since-crisis) under the Tories, while food banks etc are at record levels even for the employed. And all that during a recession. That's what you call a rigged economy. Just wait for the next recession and they're going to get even richer.\n\n>The question is whether Labour could do any better\n\nI think they could! Increased public spending has been proven to stimulate the economy and was standard economic practice in the 20th century. In fact, Roosevelt, the US president during WW2, offered very similar economic plans to Corbyn (education, mass building of houses, healthcare, workers rights, investing in infrastructure) for 10+ years during the New Deal period on the tail end of the worst recession in world history and it is largely heralded to be one of the major factors that made the US the super power it is today. Increased public spending always lowers unemployment and stimulates the economy. Building houses will get the homeless off the streets and back into the work force. Investing in education is a no-brainer unless you want above average immigration. \n\n> so that we dip back into it when the next recession comes around.\n\nUpsetting that most people have given up on the idea of having an economy resistant to recession... There weren't many throughout the welfare state era of Keynesian economics. \n",

Schools want children on free school meals.
