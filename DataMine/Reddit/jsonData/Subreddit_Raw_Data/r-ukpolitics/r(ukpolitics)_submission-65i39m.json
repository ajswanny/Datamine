To be clear, I completely accept [Dougie's argument](https://www.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/65i39m/_/dgaktwf). We need to remain critical about the silly stories we read published about North Korea, there's no doubt about that, but we almost need to be able to take seriously the very strong cumulative evidence about the conditions in the country including the concentration camps. We need to draw a very hard line between those two, and not confuse them. I concede to that argument completely.",

However... 6 days ago: http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-39542990 - \n**North Korea missiles: US warships deployed to Korean peninsula**\n\nHold yer fuckin horses... since when did annual, uneventful navy excercises become an major US fleet deployment in preparation to strike NK? It didn't.\n\nNK also does nuke tests fairly often, so it's also not that big of a story for them to be preparing to test another.\n\nMy bet is that all this kerfuffle started with the fucking Independent misrepresenting all this, in addition to US media. It's the sale level of stupidity as if Spanish media proclaim that the British are about to invade when we have a fleet saling near the Spanish coast in order to stop off at Gibraltar to refuel.\n\nWe've got **China** - really, China - telling the USA government, the anti-Trump Ultras, and the US and UK media, to shut up because it might cause an \"accidental conflict.\" \n\nStorm in a teacup.

How they assassinate opponents around the world with chemical weapons? How about the half dozen nuclear tests they've already conducted? The ICBMs they continue to perfect?  \n \nWhat's your policy on how to stop Kim making good on his promises once they can successfully put a warhead inside a rocket? Do you realise that US ships can be despatched to a region as a political maneuver rather than a prelude to war? That a show of support for an ally may actually be a deterrent to violence, rather than allow a despotic regime to continue emboldened in WMD development?  \n\nYou realise that, not only have no Western countries suggested military action, or even going to war, with North Korea; even if that was to happen, it would be a fairly quick and easy victory militarily for the West? The battle is not the hard part, it's the humanitarian crises of millions of refugees and the ensuing geopolitical maelstrom that's the hard part. \n\nPlugging your fingers in your ears and repeating *the world we be absolutely fine if we mind our own business and do nothing* do not a good policy make - you can ask Chamberlain",

Trident could reach; but unless you seriously think NK technology is advancing so swiftly that they'll skip straight from intermediate range rocket forces straight to parity with modern Western systems in the near future, I doubt the residents of Glasgow need to stockpile bean tins and dig in in their allotments just yet.\n\nPretty sure even if NK could magic up the weapons AND were silly enough to go for a first strike nuclear attack, they would use them against the US, South Korea and/or Japan who pose a conventional threat to them that NK can only hope to counter with nuclear weapons. Rather than waste one of their small number of weapons putting a crater in a country that's broadly disinterested in them at present, but could and would respond by annihilating the whole of NK with a counter strike.\n\nSo all in all I respectfully disagree with your position!\n",

He'd been told to leave both Saudi Arabia and Sudan for good reason too.  He most definitely was an advocate of exporting Jihadism to the West.  I'm no fan of the Taliban (not that that should need saying,   but here you are) but they weren't advocates of exporting Jihadism to the West.  They were all about being tyrants in their own country.\n\nClearly OBL had some responsibility for 9/11 (you dickhead).  His group had already carried out prior attacks against embassies, the World Trade Centre, the US Cole.  There was a bundle of evidence on him.\n\nWhat I am opposed to is that we didn't have to go to war in Afghanistan and the Afghanis themselves had bugger all to do with 9/11.\n\nSo fuck you for your allegation :)\n\nAnd fuck you for your revisionist history :))\n\nApt username.",
