They're there to take part in the leadership debate against leaders of parties standing in constituencies they're contesting. They are still UK national parties with representation in the UK Parliament; that the SNP or Plaid Cymru for example choose not to field candidates in England is irrelevant. Why stand where you won't win any seats? No UK political party as far as I'm aware stands in every seat in the country. If Yorkshire First gained some MPs I wouldn't be opposed to them getting to take part in the debates.\n\nPeople not from England have to put up with politicians not speaking to them all the time, and that's pretty much always the \"national\" conversation. This is just a situation where there are people with a national platform who aren't talking to England.",

    "body": "I don't follow politics never have, had zero interest in it until the Tories took over. But as I know and work with people who have cerable palsy and down syndrome what the Tories did is disgusting. The fact that you say 'free stuff' shows you either don't really know anyone disabled or are completely out of touch with what they go through. Do you know whats its like for a person with celebal palsy? They arent like you and me. They cant do anything by themselves. They need carers and have to pay for taxis. This is where extra money hells. They cant just jump on a bus or drive. Listen these people would give anything to be able to walk and work like everyone else but some of them cant even go to the toilet without assistant. Yet funnily enough I hear about mp's giving themselves payrises constantly. Nurses and doctors deserve payrises far more than mp's do.  Imagine in a few years one of your parents or someone close to you ended up in a wheelchair. I bet your opinion would be different then. I pay my taxes and work like everyone else but it doesnt mean I'm fine with watching other people suffer.  Remember that army vet who starved to death because of cuts.                                                      https://www.google.co.uk/amp/www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/killed-benefits-cuts-starving-soldier-3923771.amp                                                             I cant even tell you who Im going to vote for but I will vote for who ever isnt a complete cunt. Doesnt take a lot to be a decent person in life.",

Part of that is indeed vacuous soundbites (i.e. just staying on message to avoid questions - something that is only half a level above Gordon Brown tractor statistics). But her speeches do tend to be better than that. Because she has prepared them. \n\nIt really isn't weird at all. Everyone's brain has stronger and weaker areas. May is clearly (from Prime Minister's Questions) not brilliant in head-to-head debate. Corbyn isn't a great wit either - does this make him a bad leader of the opposition? No, it's his other characteristics that do that. Tony Blair was smooth and charismatic as you like, and is a candidate for the most hated man in Britain. Thatcher too.",

And at times that happens, and at other times it doesn't. Your MP will also have input into the party position though and they will generally be able to do a better job of representing you, than your party leader would. \n\nTo put it another way, lets say you are anti-Nuclear (power, weapons, waste whatever..), and that is a major red line for you in terms of voting.  Do you vote for an MP that is pro-nuclear because their leader is anti, or do you vote for an MP that is anti-nuclear even though their leader is pro? Your MP might be running campaigns in support of your position against the general policy position of their party (happens a lot in contentious areas.) surely that's more valuable than a soundbite in a TV debate.\n\n>ultimate control remains with the party leaders.\n\nSome control remains with the leaders, diluted by cabinet and subject to the support of MPs more generally.  Putting a spotlight on the leaders is then unhelpful for anything other than making the UK system seem far more presidential than it is and creating more antipathy toward politicians as people realise that the person they voted for, isn't the person they saw on TV..",
