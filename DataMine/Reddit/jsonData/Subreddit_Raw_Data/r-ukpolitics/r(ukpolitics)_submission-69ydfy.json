I've experienced some of them first-hand and understand the arguments. Whether or not this aspect of the EU is a deciding factor in someone's preference for remaining or leaving is obviously a different question, but the idea that no-one voting Leave had genuine reasons to do so that were actually the EU's fault is a bit daft.\n\n> Apart from the bit about advantages of making our own trade deals which if you have done the lowest course of economics possible you'd know is misguided at best.\n\nApparently neither my own knowledge of economics nor those of a few people with related PhDs who explained it to me is up to this one. The idea that the UK will magically have trade deals with everyone in the short term is obviously wildly optimistic, but in the long term, why isn't it plausible that the UK would do better making its own deals?\n\nAs a deal-making proxy, the EU has failed for a very long time to come up with a good deal with the US, often because the US made excessive demands that the EU couldn't accept, so arguments about the EU being a more effective negotiator because its larger size gives it more bargaining power don't look so convincing any more. Heck, it took the EU 7 years to make a trade deal with *Canada*, which is about as nice a place and as similar a people as you're likely to find in this world, and that was partly because while the EU is bigger it also has a lot of different member states, each of which naturally has its own interests and priorities in any particular trade negotiation.\n\nAs for the UK being able to make deals on its own when the time comes, again, the EU just spent 7 years making a deal with Canada, a valuable trading partner but obviously a smaller and more distant one than the UK. It seems unlikely that once the egos get put back in their boxes the EU won't want a decent deal with the UK, and vice versa obviously. Again this is obviously not going to happen within the initial two-year window short of some miraculous breakthrough, but in the medium term it seems quite realistic.\n\nMaybe I'm too optimistic. I take the view that if we're going to leave then the priority now should be making the most of the opportunities and freedoms that brings, and doing what we can to moderate the costs. But it seems to me that the EU's recent performance in trade negotiations isn't exactly a tough act to follow, and I see no fundamental reason that in the longer term (say 10-20 years from now) the UK couldn't wind up with better trade relationships than it would have achieved continuing as an EU member state.",

    "body": "> why isn't it plausible that the UK would do better making its own deals?\n\nBecause larger parties always hold the upper hand in negotiations. Thats why when parties want to trade with the EU they must adjust their own rules or be denied. Aside from the fact most of the world's countries are shifting towards entering there deals, we are the first country to be going the other way. Why would the UK be better at organising a trade deal with ASEAN, ECOWAS, NAFTA countries, North African Union etc. The fact is the world is going towards trade blocs because it is the most effective way of trade creation.\n\nI think you are looking into the wrong parts of the deals to see the sticking points. The EU takes this long to organise trade deals as unlike the North American countries they make sure chemicals etc are safe. Therefore when you have a country like America which is also considered a large enough entity to change smaller trading partners habits they are stubborn on wanting to export their dangerous/poisonous products. It takes a lot time also because some products that Canada is big on we receive from Scandinavia and therefore needed to carefully negotiate it.\n\nI think you are a little too optimistic and are over simplifying trade negotiation to effectively business deals. It is a tough act to follow as these trade deals are insanely difficult to thresh out. Apart from the fundamental reason of its more beneficial to exist without tariffs in the largest market in the world than not, there are many other non fundamental reasons why we won't be as powerful now we have left:\n\n* Population deficit\n\n* No longer the US's seat in Europe\n\n* Every third world country is gonna want free movement for free trade.\n\n* Massive trade deficit with the rest of the world which won't exactly give us influence at the top.\n\nI'm concerned about the idea of opportunities from Brexit. When I hear that I believe it to be a word used more in shadowy speech dinners attended by people like Osbourne. I think a short term positive approach is a bit deluded. I think a long term approach of saying we won't 100% implode is more likely. The current costs are zero for the largest market in the world. The costs for the rest of the world are to remain the same for the foreseeable future. Businesses when they need to become lean, cut jobs and investment first so I can see how business will adapt but I'm not so sure about its (now) ex-employees.\n\nWhy would countries offer the UK a better trade deal than one with the largest single market in the world? Were they just holding the real good shit back until the UK unpredictably left the EU and then the country can whip it out and give more benefit to themselves than they possess from trading already? If this amazing benefit exists why isn't every country doing it? I think we think we are ahead of the curve while everyone else in the EU thinks we have a death wish.",

    "body": "> Because larger parties always hold the upper hand in negotiations. Thats why when parties want to trade with the EU they must adjust their own rules or be denied.\n\nSo the theory goes. However, there are exactly two economies in the world outside the EU that are much larger than the UK's: the US and China. The former is literally my example of the EU failing to reach a viable trade deal despite expending a lot of resources over many years trying to do so, and since anyone can walk away if no deal can be reached regardless of their size, it's not clear to me that the EU's theoretically greater bargaining power is doing much good in practice.\n\nAfter the US and China, the next slice of global economies are on a similar scale to the UK, with Japan and Germany slightly bigger but within a factor of 2, and then other large EU members and the likes of India, Canada and Brazil within a factor of 2-3 the other way. Those outside the EU would be negotiating more-or-less as equals in any future deal, while those inside the EU have a strong incentive to push the EU to reach a deal with the UK reasonably quickly (and since the UK is already in compliance with EU regulations at the moment, it seems reasonable to hope that such a deal should be at least somewhat quicker and easier to reach than when the EU has negotiated with other states that don't share the common history).\n\n> Why would the UK be better at organising a trade deal with ASEAN, ECOWAS, NAFTA countries, North African Union etc. The fact is the world is going towards trade blocs because it is the most effective way of trade creation.\n\nThose trade blocs aren't the same type of organisation as the EU, though. The EU is unique in the world in the closeness of its ties built around the Single Market, Customs Union and Eurozone. The other way of looking at this is that the EU imposes greater restrictions on member states operating independently than other trade blocs.\n\nFor example, as we've been discussing, the EU negotiated a deal with Canada and failed to negotiate one so far with the US; it wasn't negotiating with the NAFTA group collectively.\n\n> I think a short term positive approach is a bit deluded.\n\nI agree. In fact, I'd go further: I think expecting things to be better in the short term is entirely unrealistic, and in economic terms the immediate fallout from Brexit will be more about damage limitation than anything else. It will surely take significant time to negotiate any future deals, with the EU or otherwise. In the meantime, both the uncertainty and potentially the loss of some or all of what we previously had as an EU member will obviously have a cost. I know some reasonable people who felt that just these problems alone were sufficient cause to vote Remain, and they may well prove to be right.\n\n> The current costs are zero for the largest market in the world.\n\nOn this, I totally disagree. As I mentioned, small business owners have many legitimate concerns about the EU.\n\nAt some of my businesses, a significant proportion of our entire administrative overhead comes directly from EU rules, perhaps even the majority of it. Crucially, neither we as a business *nor* our customers or staff gain much real world benefit from many of those rules.\n\nThere's also the VAT issue. It's an absurdly complicated system with significant administration costs. Then because other EU rules require us to show tax-inclusive prices for B2C sales, effectively we also take a hit of up to 20% or more on each sale to an EU-based customer compared to non-EU customers. (I'm still trying to figure out how this approach makes any sense given the original intent of VAT, but so far even with lawyers, MPs and HMRC officials in the discussions I don't think I have a good answer.)\n\n> Why would countries offer the UK a better trade deal than one with the largest single market in the world?\n\nI believe the standard argument here is that they might offer a better trade deal *for the UK*.\n\nIf the UK is getting into a deal as part of the EU, that deal has been negotiated on behalf of the entire EU, with 28+ different sets of priorities and concerns taken into account just on the EU's side of the negotiation. As we have seen with controversial areas like the CAP, the interests of those member states do not always align and sometimes outright conflict.\n\nAs we have also seen, as recently as the closing stages of the Canada negotiations, even a small part of a single member state in the EU can potentially cause disruption in closing a deal for everyone. That case was particularly interesting because other people from around the EU might have sympathised with the underlying reasons for the dissent and not necessarily agreed with the way the dissenting area was basically stamped on until it fell into line to get the deal closed.\n\nSo the argument I heard was that it's not really about whether a potential trading partner would offer more to the UK than it would to the EU. It's about whether the UK would have more choice about what it considered the priorities in any trade deal, and consequently both more flexibility to negotiate in other areas to reach a compromise and more ability to establish deal-breakers if it had to.",

The Brexit vote was incredibly close run... there was a difference of about 4%...\n\n> For example UK-wise in the 80s the greens hit about 10% of votes and whilst FPTP kept them out it was enough for the main parties to grab parts of their agenda.\n\nParties just generally tend to steal vote-winning policies.\n\nRemember the minimum wage increase Miliband wanted to introduce, it was a vote winner; and so the Tories have stolen it. Not really anything to do with being \"scared\" or whatever you're trying to say here.\n\n> I suspect that Brexit could have been headed off by compromise if the centre actually believed it was highly likely.\n\nThe EU is compromise all the way down. Additionally change takes time, and the EU is still in its infancy.",

    "body": "Would that have not already happened? The two main reasons I see for France not wanting to adopt English are:\n\n* Sizeable francosphere already\n\nE.g. it has ex-colonies who all speak French and it has rather large french specific industries (Cinema, tv news etc.) that cater to the francosphere. Additionally french mainlanders can go almost their whole lives without ever needing English.\n\n* The language is a big part of who French people are\n\ne.g. they tie it indistinguishably with their national identity. This probably is hard to understand as English is used everywhere and has been corrupted (colour, color) numerous times by ex-colonies. But the French do not like this and would not stand for it, and have an institution defining the very words they use.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acad%C3%A9mie_fran%C3%A7aise\n\nI would like to believe you, I'm an EU Federalist Brit afterall; i'm just not so sure.",
