We can readily see and easily understand one person lying to a council worker to get a few extra pounds a week. Someone registering a fictional entity like a company in a foreign country we'll never see in order to not move a few electronic figures from one virtual bank account to another, is less relatable.  \nThere's also the issue of what is *earnt*. To a lot of people, a rich person will be earning their money. By fair means or foul, a fair amount or grossly inflated, it doesn't really matter. Richard Branson earns millions from, say, music and an airline, Sergei Brin earns millions from a search engine, Kashoggi earns millions from arms dealing. Doesn't really matter. People find that less morally objectionable than someone taking money they've not earnt in any way e.g. by lying about living on their own when they actually have a working partner, signing off work with stress when there's nothing wrong with them.",

Even while they're complaining that they're broke and are clearly upset that they cannot find a job, they still constantly spend money on things they don't need, but refuse to go without (usually centered around going out drinking, which they act like they'll literally wither and die if they can't do at least once a week). These people will regularly still somehow manage to scrape together enough to provide themselves or their kids with the latest and greatest tech once the holidays come around. It's not even always your typical stereotype of someone on benefits, they will often be ostensibly living middle class lifestyles but seem to constantly be broke somehow, and then have no contingency as soon as the slightest thing goes wrong financially. \n\nThese people aren't technically 'cheating', and a lot of it seems to be more down to stupidity than malice, but I've known more people like this than I have people who've genuinely fallen on hard times through no fault of their own. The latter are what state assistance is supposed to be about, not subsiding people's inability to manage money.

It simply berates people for being bad at numbers and concludes that this is very odd.\n\nFirstly, the rich actually earned their money.  Whether it's by hard work, by possessing unique talents, by simply being a good worker, or by maintaining good relations with people who are one or more of the above, the rich are rich because they deserve it.  They got their money from us, because that's how valuable they are to us; why else would we give them money?  And on the other hand, there are the scroungers.  These people, society has decided, are worth nothing - they don't work at all because they chose to have 5 kids with another one along the way, and they're gaming the system off our hard-earnt money in such a way that they're earning as much, if not more, than we are.  There's a fundamental principle of fairness, justice, or morality - whatever you choose to call it - that makes us sympathize with the rich much more than with the poor.\n\nSecondly, there's also the more practical argument that the rich are already overtaxed.  The higher the rate of tax, the more likely that people start engaging in dodgy accounting or other means of tax evasion or tax avoidance.  The high rate of tax is effectively a penalty on the cr\u00e8me of the country, and we're incentivising these people to spend more time on thinking about new, clever ways to avoid taxes, rather than new, clever ways to help us get out of our political-economic crises.  In fact, the Paradise Papers was (to me at least) further indication that we would be better off if we cut tax rates.  Basically, there's nothing you can do to stop people from wanting to keep the money they earnt; but there is a lot you can do to stop people from scrounging away at your tax money.\n\nThe article suggests that it's because people are bad at big numbers.  I think it's simply because people are moral and because people are practical.  It's moral to uphold the rights of the rich to find legal ways to keep more of their money, and it's immoral to live off of everyone else's hard work.  It's impractical to spend more and more time combating the rich's efforts to hold onto their money - but it's practical to ensure that people don't try to game the government for money.\n\nThere are more points, but those are probably the most obvious ones that I would raise in objection to the article.",

I believe it actually costs the government more to crack down on benefit scrounging than the actual benefit scrounging does, so weirdly the optimum state of affairs is to expect and tolerate a certain level of people abusing the system (to a degree)\n\n+1 for part of the problem being that people have met way more benefit cheats than billionaires. I often feel like a lot of people who claim to cheat benefits are kind of putting up a facade that their lives are actually not as bad as they really are, because they dont want to be in a position where they need benefits so they sort of half pretend that they're cheating the system. That's a total guess though\n\nOn the other hand I think the papers are also very much to blame for people's expectations of the scale of benefits scroungers - they run those stories and make it seem like a disproportionately huge issue to stir up hatred and sell papers, which is no good",

It's a common working class trope to be proud of being dumb and struggling your whole life and to act as though that's a good situation and one that you should berate and beat your kids into following.\n\nAny one who had working class parents at the time when working class people had jobs will probably recount their parents lambasting them about working.\n\nThatcher's Britain changed the landscape there though. Now the working classes are mostly depicted as drug-addled benefit cheats rather than like the horses in Animal Farm, working themselves to death for the benefit and wealth of pigs.\n\nThis idea of work being moral was pushed by the church onto people (like most things religion tells poor people, for the benefit of rich and powerful people) - the devil makes work for idle hands and so forth.\n\n[Bertrand Russell disagreed and wrote an essay to that end](http://www.zpub.com/notes/idle.html)\n\nWhereas, in contrast, whereas years ago with the class society we typically were taught to \"know your place\" and not expect, except in a Dickensian story, to find our situation changing, in modern life we all want to believe - perhaps in some cultures more than others - that we could, through this hard work rise to the point where we are wealthy. (The corollary to this are the dreamers who want to win the lottery or win X factor - years ago it was the football pools that working class people would play in the hope of escaping their miserable lives)\n\nAs such we are more likely to perceive the incredibly rich as hard working, or incredibly intelligent etc (look at people like Musk and Gates and the levels of sycophancy levelled at a couple of guys who are smart, but are certainly not particularly smart)\n\nAnd it doesn't take much wealth and comfort to tip someone into the belief that what he has is down to his hard work, intelligence etc and thus is deserved. Once you convince people they deserve their wealth, they are obviously going to look more favourably on success than failure.",

Now if it were twice as much and you could get it without a wait (like this universal basic income I keep seeing discussed) then yes I agree moral hazard might start to be a factor - I'm sure a significant number of people in really shitty jobs would rather scrape by on UBI than submit themselves to whatever unpleasant, undignified zero-hours grind they currently do.",

I think the shows we see on TV are designed to cause outrage from workers paying tax. \n\nThe only ones who annoy me are the ones who are proud to be cheating the system and funnily enough tend to be the type happy to flaunt their earnings on Channel 5 documentaries, much to producers delight.\n\nThink it's also partly the \"would you do it?\" question. If you give most working people a way to pay less tax on their earnings they'd probably do it. \n\nWhereas how many would be willing to cheat the benefits system and deal with the stigma attached?",

She has a daughter with downs syndrome and during a through a period of her life (she was going through a nasty divorce) she inadvertently overclaimed. That isn't to excuse her, but just to give context.\n\nWhen investigating her claim, they suggested her children could be taken away from her (with no indication of her parenting skills, just because of the claim issue), but eventually agreed to allow her to pay back the overclaim at an agreed amount each month as the money actually was going to her disabled daughter, my niece.\n\nThey then withdrew that offer, took her to court, who decided she should pay back the money as originally agreed as it was an accident.\n\nCompletely anecdotal, except to say the DWP did not attend the trial. They only sent lawyers. I think they are paid on commission for the cases they win against people who abuse the system, which is good to a point, until they start trying to  find people who aren't intentionally doing so, and punishing them too... and with a heavy hammer.",

    "body": "The problem there is that \"finding any job because you would otherwise be destitute\" is not equivalent, and is (for the nation as well as individually) very much worse than \"finding a job appropriate for one's skills and situation\". If a machinist or a programmer (or even just a very good barman or waiter) is forced to take a job that doesn't use their skills effectively, the nation loses out on their extra productivity in the first instance, and then doubly so when a job that they could have done well, is instead filled by someone who needs additional training. \n\nOn the other side, where someone is forced to take a job that pays less than they would normally be able to command, because the labour market is too tight, there are substantial knock on effects if they have to cut their consumption (or worse, if they have to default on debts), and that also causes economic problems in the wider society. \n\nIt's very much as economists have been warning since 2009 or so: getting unemployment down is only half the picture, because you also have to get people into good jobs that pay well and keep productivity up. Otherwise the situation can easily turn into stagflation (which is an even more difficult trap to escape). As a result, the economist-designed unemployment benefit systems either tend towards a French model with a shortened high-rate period (which allows skilled workers to take a bit longer to find a new job before their situation becomes critical and they have to take the pay and productivity hits) or a universal basic income (which changes the whole situation enormously in ways I can't comfortably write on a phone keyboard). But \"force people into the first available job even if it means a surgeon has to stack shelves\" isn't a viable solution, and that's what the current benefits policy amounts to - either self-support on savings as a pro, or take an unskilled job.
