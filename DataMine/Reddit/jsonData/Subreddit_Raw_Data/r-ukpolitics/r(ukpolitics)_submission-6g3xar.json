The whole purpose of mocking Corbyn was to get the public nice and angry with him so we can call a snap election, you know, we can't lose - because of the implication.\n\nOh. Uh, okay. You had me going there for the first part. The second half kind of threw me.\n\nWell, dude, think about it. They're looking at the a parties and there's some dude they barely know. They look around, and what else do they see? Nothing but the Tories. \"Ah, there's no one else to vote for. What am I going to do, vote Corbyn?\"\n\nOkay. That-that seems really risky.\n\nNo, it's not risky. You're misunderstanding me, bro.\n\nI think I am.\n\nYeah, you are. Because if the public votes for Corbyn, then the answer obviously is no majority.\n\nNo.\n\nThe thing is, they're not gonna vote for Corbyn. They would never vote for Corbyn, because of the implication.\n\nNow, you've said that word \"implication\" a couple of times. Wh-What implication?\n\nThe implication that things might go wrong for them if they refuse to vote for me. Now, not that things are gonna go wrong for them but they're thinking that they will.\n\nBut it sounds like they don't want to vote for you.\n\nWhy aren't you understanding this? They don't know whether they want to vote for me.\n\nThat's not the issue. Are you gonna hurt voters?\n\nI'm not going to hurt the voters. Why would I ever hurt the voters?\n\nI don't know.\n\nI feel like you're not getting this.\n\nI'm not getting it.\n\nGoddamn.\n\n\\*Looks at the rich\\*\n\nThey certainly wouldn't be in any danger.\n\nSo they *are* in danger?\n\nNo one's in any danger.\n\nHow can I make that any more clear to you? Okay, it's an implication of danger.\n\nYou know what? Just drop it.\n\nLet's drop it.\n",

Either lose votes from angry voters or lose money and lose votes from not being able to campaign. Thus the Conservatives dropped Cameron and set up Theresa May to be the patsy. May will now leave and the Conservatives will choose their actual PM. The snap election was all part of the plan. Conservatives wanted to be able to tell the Super Brexiters that there is no mandate for a \"hard-brexit\" and move forward with a brexit that their special interests can approve to or if Labour wins Corbyn will have to handle the shitty negotiating that will have to happen with brexit and the Conservatives can just criticize him from the sidelines.
