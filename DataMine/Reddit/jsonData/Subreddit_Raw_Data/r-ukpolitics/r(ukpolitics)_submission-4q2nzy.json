How do we know it's not the 20m people who didn't bother voting?\n\nMost of the leave voters weren't even accounted for on online polls, but now we're lead to believe by the biased media that they're all hurridly googling what they just voted for?\n\nYou really think that the old, and poor (Those who overwhelmingly voted leave) are *googling* \"what is the EU\"?\n\nIt's more (As if they couldn't get any more) arrogance from the establishment, and the far left. They simply cannot accept that people disagree with them.\n\nAlso, it's more lazy journalism. Why actually do some research, when you can just copy some tweets down, or grab some chart from Google trends and slap it up as fact. Oooh! Managed to find 6 people who regret voting leave? Well we can make a massive news story about that and claim those 6 people are representative of 17 million people. It's just utter bollocks.\n\nPerhaps you meant it in jest, and understand what a bullshit non-story it was. If so, ignore the above :)\n\nedit: As Candayence adds, the volume of searches was so low as to not have any significance. ",
