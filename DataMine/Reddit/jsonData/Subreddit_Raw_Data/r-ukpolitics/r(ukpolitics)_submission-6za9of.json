They sent their disciples to him along with the Herodians. \"Teacher,\" they said, \"we know you are a man of integrity and that you teach the way of God in accordance with the truth. You aren't swayed by men, because you pay no attention to who they are. Tell us then, what is your opinion? Is it right to pay taxes to Caesar or not?\"\n\n> But Jesus, knowing their evil intent, said, \"You hypocrites, why are you trying to trap me? Show me the coin used for paying the tax.\" They brought him a denarius, and he asked them, \"Whose portrait is this? And whose inscription?\"\n\n> \"Caesar's,\" they replied.\n\n> Then he said to them, \"Give to Caesar what is Caesar's, and to God what is God's.\"\n\n>When they heard this, they were amazed. So they left him and went away.\n\nRomans 13:1:\n\n> \"Everyone must submit himself to the governing authorities, for there is no authority except that which God has established. The authorities that exist have been established by God.\"\n\nRomans 13:5-7:\n\n> Therefore, it is necessary to submit to the authorities, not only because of possible punishment but also because of conscience. This is also why you pay taxes, for the authorities are God's servants, who give their full time to governing. Give everyone what you owe him: If you owe taxes, pay taxes; if revenue, then revenue; if respect, then respect; if honor, then honor.\n\n",

    "body": "I'm gonna paste something I posted on FB a wgile back regarding socialism. I know this post isn't about socialism per se, but it follows the same vein of using Jesus to justify economic practices:\n\n\"Well, y'know, if Jesus were around today He would be all about socialism.\"\n\nNo. No He wouldn't. And let me tell you why.\n\n\"Each one must give as he has decided in his heart, not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver. \" (II Corinthians 9:7)\n\nIt's pretty straightforward. You can't force others to be altruistic. Yes, charity is good and God does want us to give to the needy. But only by our own will. Not the government's. Because if our hands are being forced then it's not really us that are being charitable, is it?\n\nAnd on a broader note, I don't think Jesus really cared about government at all. I mean that's the impression I got from the whole \"Render unto Caesar\" thing (Mark 12:17). And why would He anyway? We know from I Samuel 8 that God was straight-up anti-government. When Israel demanded their own king, Samuel, speaking for God, said, \"Look, you really don't want that. If you have a king, all he's gonna do is take your stuff, take your land, and enslave you.\" But Israel was like, \"No yea we're okay with that just give us a king.\" And then Samuel did that thing where you raise your eyebrows and sigh and then say \"All right,\" in a high-pitched voice. And so Israel got a king. AND YOU'LL NEVER GUESS WHAT HAPPENED.\n\nThe point is, God used Israel as an example to show us that we don't need to self-govern, because God is our king. His rule and His law is all the guidance we need.\n\nSo no, don't tell me Jesus would have been a socialist, or a conservative, or a protectionist, or a globalist, or any other political moniker. Jesus was never political in any form. He was just good, in every sense.",

He did not say that his level of compassion for the poor was formed on the basis of the catholic teaching.  \n\nHe also (very poorly and borderline unsuccessfully) attempted to comunicate that these were his personal views, and that he tries to separate these from his politics.  \n\nPiers Morgan sat opposite him trying to use the argument that he himself is a Catholic, who does not agree with the catholic churches view on gay marriage. Here we have an example of a man following a faith, but dismissing parts of it, or perhaps even cherry picking the few parts he agrees with!\n\nOne can't allow Piers Morgan the argument that he dismisses some parts of the catholic church, whilst remaining catholic, and not extend the same courtesy to Mogg.\n\nMy personal opinion is I think it's a pretty shit set of things he's cherry picking/dismissing, I don't support it at all in the slightest. They are vile opinions not fit for Britain, or anywhere in the modern world.\n\nTL;DR: Mogg clearly selects choice parts of the bible to practice, and others to ignore, just like I daresay the majority of religious people out there. But at no point does he deny this, so far he only says he gets his opinions on 2 subjects from catholic teachings, not 100% of them.",

He said he holds traditional Catholic beliefs on abortion but recognises those beliefs will never be socially acted upon, because the \u2018democratic majority\u2019 thinks differently. There you have it. No need for controversy. Because he isn\u2019t seeking to impose his views on us or to change the laws of the country; he\u2019s just going to carry on believing them. This is what it means to live in a tolerant country: people can believe anything they want, but they cannot force anyone else to believe those things. What\u2019s the problem here? Unless we\u2019re saying we have a problem with the very fact that there are people who have certain thoughts in their minds. If we have a problem with that, then Britain is in very serious trouble.",

Practicing scientists with a PhD it drops to around 7%. \n\nMost of the \"proof\" of the existence of a deity is found at the limits of our knowledge of the physical universe and as the younger generations who are being educated with a greater perspective of the universe it is likely that the number of people who believe in a deity will decrease.\n\nJust to be clear, because I know some people might take offence to what I just wrote, I am not saying that by believing in a god it means that you are uneducated, just that you were educated at a time where we as the human race knew less about our physical universe than we do today. Newton used god to balance the forces of our solar system when doing his laws of motion. And this is a guy who invented calculus pretty much on a dare.

Salvation is offered freely on the basis of repentance only, not good works. *However*, good works are a demonstration that the repentance is serious. \n\nIn Mogg's case, I think that he needs to re-read [the parable of the sheep and the goats.](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+25:31-46) Jesus says: \u201cTruly I tell you, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me.\u201d and \u201cTruly I tell you, whatever you did not do for one of the least of these, you did not do for me.\u201d He makes no distinction between our responsibilities according to whether we are a private individual, acting on behalf of a government, or an MP who by and large supports the govenment of the day.\n\nI am afraid that it seems to me that Rees-Mogg, May, Duncan-Smith and co are following J K Galbraith's observation that [\"The modern conservative is engaged in one of man's oldest exercises in moral philosophy; that is, the search for a superior moral justification for selfishness.](https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/quotes/j/johnkennet107301.html)\n\nWhatever, my own reading of the Bible seems to throw up much more about socio-economic morality than about sexual behaviour.",

The people of the time were obsessed with what scholars call a *Messianic Hope*, which is to say that they believed that the long-promised Messiah was about to be born and save them all.\n\nWas Jesus the Son of God? That's your own question to answer, but assuming it's a 'No', in this cauldron of social unrest, Jesus went around preaching the advent of the Kingdom of God, and was preaching what the laws of such a society would look like. As others have said, would he really have been calling for revolution by demanding to replace it all with the exact same thing?\n\nHe spent so much of his time with tax collectors (publicans) he got a name for himself, and even assigned one of them (St Matthew) to be one of his right-hand men and a leader in his new kingdom. He clearly wasn't against the idea of a social contract. On the contrary, everything he said was about strengthening your neighbour and building (basically) an egalitarian utopia. When a rich man asked if he could be a part of the movement, Jesus told him to give away all he owned. He gave that charge to everyone, but the specific question was, 'what's holding me back?' and the answer was 'your wealth.'\n\nDid he favour socialism or capitalism? If we have to ascribe his teachings to a political system we understand, it would without a doubt be socialism. He routinely called for society to be reinforced, and wasn't opposed in the slightest to pooling together a community's resources to achieve equality.\n\nOf course, you can always read the Gospel of Supply Side Jesus and ask yourself how Christian capitalism feels when Jesus is spouting off about job creation.\n\nYou should also look up the history of usury, and how the Christian religions abandoned it in the middle ages. But eh ancient Jews and early Christians looked at interest on money lending as sinful.\n\nHaving said all of that, what we have of the Bible has come to us through ancient texts which are probably a little off after 2000 years of translations and revisions.\n",

I would suspect it would be more like either the woman they wanted to stone, \"Let he who is without sin cast the first stone\" or when they took Him from the synagogue in Nazareth to a cliff, intending to throw him off because he had dared to tell them som uncomfortable truths, \"But he walked right through the crowd and went on his way.\"",

The second implies a direct role by God in establishing said authorities, therefore implying you are paying taxes to a divine institution. The third quote subverts both other quotes by kind of saying you should pay taxes for your own conscience, but also saying that you \"owe\" taxes to governors who are faithful and pure servants.\n\nIf anything, the third quote ironically paints why we *shouldn't* justify tax increases for the supposed need to help the poor. Because the bottom line is, we pay taxes for a welfare system *right now* that is innefficient and fails to get people off the street, whilst most of the money goes towards employing the innefficient bureaucracy behind it. Not everyone at every level of our current, broken system is \"God's servant\".",

I think it was Al-Ghazali who basically wrote how to be a \"good Muslim\" and contained within that was something about the manipulation of numbers being a sin (something to that effect, anyone more up to speed with the Muslim faith, please feel free to correct me).... before that point Arab muslims were at the forefront of maths and physics advancement, but since then very few muslims have made significant contributions to the world of maths and physics... you'll also notice that the Muslim population has exploded over the last 200 years compared to world population growth. Could that be because people born into Muslim families are less likely to become religiously unaffiliated if they were not taught STEM subjects?

Although fictional, Chesterton's Father Brown never seemed to get too hung up on such things, and he was based on various priests of GKC's aquaintance.\n\nDoesn't help that I have my doubts over certain aspects of Calvinist predestination, too, but lets not go *there* now!\n\nEdit: Having re-read my first sentence above, I don't think I worded it quite right.

Not the Torah - that is on the other end of the room. Not the Rabbi - the echoes of the jangling coins are much too loud in a building like that. They are focussed on profit, on money. It takes Christ Himself to run them from the building, from the religion. \n\n>You will be rewarded if you do good, but you are not forced to.\n\nWell, you are threatened with eternal damnation.

I would not go as far as calling myself a Friend, however)\n\n>Christian doctrine in no way supports taking money away from others by force to give it to the poor\n\nWhether conversion can be seen as an act of force is up for debate, certainly. \"Faith, Hope, and Charity\" and all that. \n\n>That only applies if you live on government property\n\nI trust that you are aware of the concept of the nation state?

Instead of cherrypicking the first part, consider the last part: \"...until its purpose is achieved.\" What's that referring to?\n\n\"Therefore no one will be declared righteous in God's sight by the works of the law; rather, through the law we become conscious of our sin.\" - Romans 3:20\n\nThe \"purpose\" of the law is to open man's eyes to the realization that he is inadequate and needs a saviour. And Jesus was that saviour. When He died, He fulfilled that purpose, and it became \"achieved\" as the verse predicted. Now we are no longer bound by the letter of the law. That part about \"Until heaven and earth disappear\" isn't literal; It just means that's what would have to happen in order to stop Jesus from fulfilling His purpose.",

I guess him saying \"never be socially acted upon\" was strong but the sentiment is correct, people in 21st century Britain aren't voting for abortion bans. His point isn't that he won't vote for abortion bans, but that the majority won't vote for it. Which is correct as far as I can see.\n\nAlso, should democracy not decide these issues, if the people of northern Ireland were to vote against abortion, and it were banned, is that not how it should work? You can have all the opinions about how banning abortion \"opposes the freedoms that people should have\", but should democracy not trump your opinions on the matter? I see many people claiming that allowing abortion is against peoples rights/freedoms, while also seeing how banning it is also against peoples rights; with very little conversation between both sides. I'm genuinely curious, I've seen a lot of anti-democracy seeming conversations recently and I want to know peoples opinions who appear disagree with me.\n\nAnd what power does the DUP have to do bring about a law in the UK banning abortion? I can't find info online indicating that they have the power to do so.\n\nEdited it a bunch, sorry, my writing is a bit messy atm.",

I guess him saying \"never be socially acted upon\" was strong but the sentiment is correct, people in 21st century Britain aren't voting for abortion bans. His point isn't that he won't vote for abortion bans, but that the majority won't vote for it. Which is correct as far as I can see.\n\nThese days we've said that sort of BS about a lot of things, from Brexit to repealing the human rights charter.

We can discuss the other New Testament references you're making, but we have to get on the same page.\n\nNow, regarding the communal society described in Acts, the mandatory welfare in that case was a prerequisite for living in the commune. But no one was forced to live in the commune. It's like paying dues to a country club. No one is forcing you to be a member, but if you want to be one then you have to contribute. Furthermore, the difference between a charity and a commune is that in a commune, you're one of the people benefitting from the money you're putting into it. It's fair to ask that you contribute if you're going to reap from the spoils. But charity is a one-way transaction. So it's not fair to impose it on anybody.\n\nAnd yes, of course Jesus encourages charity. I'm not saying we shouldn't be charitable. But again, it has to be a personal decision, not one imposed by an external authority. It's like working. Working is good. But being forced to work is called slavery.

Supply side Jesus or some heretical notion, perhaps.\n\nYou are incorrect in use of comparison to a country club, the community of the early church included people who could not financially contribute. \n\nYou are also saying that the law of God imposes economic slavery, as it certainly mandates charity, which is certainly a brave position. Is that truly what you mean to assert, that you consider the old testament law to be outright bad?\n\nThat would seem to require belief that God was either mistaken or lying to decieve the Jews into following a bad law...

A lot of the previous stuff can be broken into 4 categories (I'm probably forgetting a few more but it gives a good indication):\n\n1. Rules for the Jews as God's chosen people - to do with outside signs that would demonstrate membership of that group (circumcision, not eating certain foods, dressing a certain way, facial hair, no tattoos, etc. ). \n\n2. Animal sacrifices as an atonement for sins\n\n3. Commandments with punishments that demonstrate how serious God takes sin. (Stone the adulterer)\n\n4. Commandments with punishments that demonstrate how seriously his people should take being in his presence i.e. the need to be ceremonially clean. (not eating foods, no woman on their period, not touching certain things)\n\nSo after Jesus there are logical reasons why some of these things are no longer needed.\n\n1. With Jesus' death and resurrection Gentile (non-Jewish) people are able to commune with God, they are not a member of the Jewish people so are not required to conform to those outward signs.\n\n2. Jesus Death is the one perfect sacrifice meaning sin offerings are no longer required.\n\n3. As Jesus takes the punishment for sins upon himself the earthly punishment is no longer required as the debt has been paid by Jesus. \n\n4. believers are now viewed from God's perspective as being like Jesus i.e. no sin so no need to worry about being ceremonially clean.\n\nHope that helps, though it was probably more info than you wanted ;)",
