Whereas on /r/politics for example that thread would never be seen by anyone except people who sort by controversial.

W.

    "body": "Of course it is. The proposals made with respect to my degree would have us spend time investigating the 'colonial' attitudes of thinkers such as Kant when they bear very little relevance to the materials we study, and 'globalise' the study of ancient philosophy so that ancient Eastern philosophers whose writings weren't nearly as sophisticated or lucid as the Ancient Greeks are put on a par with Plato and Aristotle.\n\nThe purpose of this these changes is to make increasingly normalised the post-colonial critical theory approach of regarding everything written by non-radical authors as 'infected' with the racist, sexist etc. attitudes they held, and to demote its importance and reliability as a result. People are welcome to do this in the degree if they like, but there's no doubt that to make it a core practice would be to introduce a slant which favours the assumptions of particular radical philosophies (this isn't to say that degrees have been, or are, free from other kinds of intrinsic biases). As well as introducing a bias, 'decolonisation' would make the degrees less rigorous and less valued, turning out lower-quality graduate, for two reasons:\n\nFirstly, it's not particularly difficult to write papers which just dissect the colonial attitudes of philosophers. It *is* difficult to actually grasp a lot of the concepts they describe. Students who believe that attacking the colonial context of an argument or theory is an equally legitimate way of criticising it as engaging with its particulars will obviously be tempted to take the easier option, and their conceptual understanding and critical thinking skills will be less developed. This is something I've observed in politics papers - stock arguments about 'intersectionality' will often score points even though they're not hard to make.\n\nSecondly, the Western tradition of philosophy is one which has evolved to a remarkable degree of sophistication through being anchored to a common set of origins, great works and thinkers, and understanding of reason and logic. Modern Western philosophy is also quite able to incorporate ideas from outside this tradition. Giving an 'equal focus' to non-Western traditions substitutes in a poorer kind of horizontal understanding for a vertical understanding. It's very difficult for students to be able to reach an understanding of the pressing problems in modern philosophy if they lack a comprehensive knowledge of the evolving arguments which produced them, and the works which they reference and build-upon, with which their forebears would have been very familiar.\n\nSo I think it's perfectly reasonable to be concerned about these spurious 'decolonisation' efforts. The group currently pushing this agenda at Oxford is a group called 'Common Ground' (see Facebook page, reddit won't let me link), which recently played host to Melz Owusu:\n\n >\u201cThe sun has not set on the British Empire,\u201d Melz says, arguing that the current education system demonstrates this. She points to Immanuel Kant.  He remains a prominent figure in the philosophy curriculum, yet he thought that black people were less than human. The position which such thinkers hold in the academic hierarchy demonstrate how deeply racist ideology is rooted in our education system.\n\nAlthough in its infancy the decolonisation movements are seeking to normalise an assumption that the presence of prejudiced views in particular thinkers and contexts has a meaningful and necessary effect on the literature produced, and that this renders almost the whole of the Western tradition of academia as vulnerable to an easy disregard. This is a contentious assumption, but if universities are persuaded to adopt it, it could threaten the quality and political neutrality of education severely.",

Dengism was unironically done from a Marxist-Leninist perspective and the party actually takes Socialism far more seriously than previously thought, not a sellout \"Capitalism is great\" one like it's been so assumed in the west.\n\nYet when I watched the news reports and read articles, they basically were basically like:\n\n- More economic liberalisation\n\n- more defence spending\n\n- more corruption crackdowns\n\n- China plans to be a \"developed nation\" by 2049\n\nDa fuq? \n\nHonestly the China Daily article gives a better overview than any of the crap that was written in western media.",

First of all, there is no such thing as a sex change. But if the common usage of the tabloid buzzword \"sex change\" and what that means holds true then there is the insinuation that kids are having Gender Confirmation Surgery. In the UK you cannot get that surgery on the NHS until you are 18 or older. Usually it's done on people in their twenties or older. Cross sex hormones are not allowed to be prescribed until you are 16 and puberty blockers (medication that simply blocks you primary sex hormone, and causes no permanent changes) can get prescribed at the onset of puberty. \n\nAlthough it's true that there is an uptick in referrals to Gender Clinics amongst young people the story is manipulative and clearly has an anti-trans, scare scaremongering slant to it. Given that it is such a sensitive issue and that these are vulnerable young people, surely this kind of news story deserves better fact checking and a better sense of clarity. An apology would definately be in order here. But it's never gonna happen. ",

    "body": "I appreciate you taking the time to explain your reasoning in-depth. Of course, much of the hysteria around this story had less to do with philosophy and more to do with the usual knee-jerk \"PC gone mad\"/White Genocide obsession of certain people. I found that reading the [original letter](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Qji9ojNzumOeKboLLBBWs5fxJfEPVAw4JDNtdz2yAtU/edit) was quite useful to understand the issue. I think the authors succinctly explain why they feel that other authors from around the world should be included. I should make clear, I'm **not** studying Philosophy or English Literature, so this is a layman's take.\n\nI understand your main point -- that some of the people pushing this have become lazy, writing off many Western writers as \"bad\" and other writers as \"good\". And that they obsess over problematic aspects of an author's history or views instead of engaging with the work they produced, or just dismissing it entirely. And that, inevitably, there is a whole \"radical\" political dimension attached to this proposal. **But** I think it's important to detach the views of an overzealous minority from the very reasonable proposal that students should be introduced to a wide variety of works, and that discussions about their historical context should be encouraged.\n\nFor example, there's nothing wrong with the suggestions here:\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/oct/26/a-decolonised-sylllabus-bame-authors-students-should-read\n\n>'globalise' the study of ancient philosophy so that ancient Eastern philosophers whose writings weren't nearly as sophisticated or lucid as the Ancient Greeks are put on a par with Plato and Aristotle\n\nHowever, isn't this really subjective? And evidence of the very attitudes that are being challenged? The point is that the decision to consider certain works to be \"the best\" was taken by a human being, and therefore those decisions are not infallible. And they may in fact have devalued certain works simply because they came from outside the West. \n\nCorrecting that isn't *that* radical. One of the responses all over twitter to this has been \"Why don't Africans/Asians learn about Western stuff\". The answer to that is they absolutely do. Western literature is taught worldwide, not necessarily because it's the best, but because of historical factors, our stuff has become influential and respected over there but the reverse isn't true.\n\nThe fact is that that they are not forcing white authors off the curriculum, but only want to expand it to include others, and that students who bring up race issues around certain works should not be made to feel unwelcome. That's reasonable. And the hysteria generated just for suggesting it, only confirms the suspicions of those who think that there is a bias against non-Western authors. And then tensions grow to the extent that students do feel, as you've outlined, that they should reject Western knowledge in general because it's an \"us vs them\" situation, whereas the example of teaching around the world shows that there is room for all of it.",

But it doesn\u2019t change the fact that Descartes said it better, in a way that was more analytically rigorous.\n\nPhilosophy isn\u2019t the same as medicine, but it\u2019s not a discipline in which there are no real perceptible degrees of sophistication, clarity and explanatory power. It\u2019s by these measures that Western philosophy might be said to be preferable. It\u2019s not the case (as it\u2019s not with science) that all writing is of equal value and the only possible cause for preference is cultural bias.",

But okay, let's humour you shall we?\n\nFirstly, (and this wasn't a question either, simply a statement you made) you can't research? 50% of the degree is research. \n\n\"How the fuck can you get a masters degree in opinions\" - my MA was rigorous and mentally tough and involved debates, delivering lectures, weeks of research into areas such as psychoanalysis and Freud, philosophy, theology, post-colonialism and my 20000 word dissertation was a study into the gendered literature of young boys and girls of the nineteenth century and the effects the literature they consumed (which was their only experience of entertainment at this period and their only representation in culture) had on their development and understanding of their gender roles and their place within the home and wider society. This took 3 months of heavy research and reading, not just fiction but published studies and meeting with people who conducted these studies and how my chosen texts informed and reinforced their findings.\n\nI have a well-paying job with plenty of opportunity to progress, branch out into other areas, or teach abroad if I wish. I have friends from the course who are equally successful, some solicitors/barristers, one is now in film production (screenwriting), one is a reporter on ITV news, one is running a literary themed florists which is doing incredibly well.\n\nWhat use is gained out of writing about To Kill A Mockingbird? My degrees encompassed everything from Shakespeare and his contemporaries to modern performance poets such as Kate Tempest. You don't just write about the text but the social, cultural and historical context that led to the writing of the text and how an audience would have responded to the text. And so I won't bother answering this question because you reduce 4 years of my academic life to one text that actually, I didn't even study.\n\n\nEdit: This also only encompasses the literature side, and doesn't even cover the sociolinguistic and etymology side of the course. \n\nAaaaaand downvoted for explaining what I studied on my literature degrees.
