    "body": "I don't think anyone who actually looked into it seriously for a second believed Corbyn actually supported terrorism. The guy is a bonafide pacifist. He's about as nonviolent as a human being can be. You could punch him in the face and he would probably just put a hand on your shoulder and ask you what's wrong. \n\nThe whole thing was an obvious smear campaign, probably spearheaded by the piece of shit waste of air turd Lynton Crosby (the same Lynton Crosby who tried to make a campaign out of linking Sadiq Khan to islamic terrorism). \n\nI think the best thing that has come out of this election is that there is nothing more they can do to Corbyn. I was not a firm supporter of Corbyn and I've said my fair share of things about him, but the shitshow that he got in the media, literally calling him a terrorist the day before the election on the front-page of the two most widely circulated newspapers, made me so angry I went out to vote for Labour. Anyone who knows anything about Corbyn knows the accusation was frankly absurd-- to suggest a guy who has spent his entire life campaigning against wars and for pacifism is somehow a secret terrorist sympathiser. \n\nAnd the worst is that it was nothing but the most distasteful opportunism. People were for a timebeing highly sensitive to terrorism in the immediate aftermath of the attacks and so the conservative campaign team realised they could plant a seed somehow, regardless of how ridiculous it was, linking Corbyn to terrorism in some way it might win them a few points. And on top of that, not too long before this they had the gall to suggest Corbyn was being distasteful and opportunistic after he gave what in reality was a perfectly valid and perfectly appropriate speech on Britain's foreign policy. \n\nI'm just glad this kind of media execution failed and so spectacularly. British people deserve more than just American mudslinging and I'm so glad they showed that they wouldn't stand for it...so with that in mind, on the one-in-a-billion off chance that Lynton Crosby somehow reads this, hop on a plane, go back to Australia or one your tax havens and fuck off, because as your last two campaigns showed, we want our politicians to argue actual policies, not win by just smearing the other guy with bollocks. \n\n/end rant",

We also know that this is not simply a matter of never having had a reasonable opportunity to do so. He was asked repeatedly in a fairly-framed question if he would condemn 'the IRA' and he declined to do so.\n\nJeremy Corbyn has a long history with the Norther Irish conflict. He understands the nuances of the condemnations he makes. As we can see from the consistency of language used across two decades, he chooses his words carefully. He knows what he's saying, and what he's saying does not amount to an condemnation of the IRA *per se*, but merely a condemnation of acts undertaken by IRA members.\n\nThe two are not the same, and Corbyn has deliberately chosen to say one and not the other. It's time this was acknowledged, and those who pointed it out were not accused of 'smear tactics' by pointing out a real nuance that others seem determined to ignore.",

Most notably, he voted against the critically important 1985 Anglo-Irish Agreement, saying:\n\n>*Does the hon. Gentleman accept that some of us oppose the agreement for reasons other than those that he has given [i.e. Unionist]? We believe that the agreement strengthens rather than weakens the border between the six and the twenty-six counties, and those of us who wish to see a united Ireland oppose the agreement for that reason.*\n\n>This is not the argument of a lonely peacemaker, working to achieve dialogue with an intransigent IRA, but that of someone who deferred to Sinn F\u00e9in\u2019s then-policy on Irish issues. Hence why Corbyn\u2019s refusal to condemn the IRA this week was so worrying \u2013 it would be one thing if he was spectacularly na\u00efve and earnestly did just believe that \u201call bombings were bad\u201d, but the fact he opposed the peace process when Sinn F\u00e9in also opposed the peace process indicates he wasn\u2019t interested in a \u201cpolitical settlement\u201d which would have ended those bombings as soon as possible. Most objectionably, whilst nowadays Corbyn claims to be ahead of Thatcher in attempting a political settlement, he neglects to mention he opposed and voted against Thatcher\u2019s most important contribution to peace when she negotiated the Anglo-Irish Agreement!\n",

You could punch him in the face and he would probably just put a hand on your shoulder and ask you what's wrong. \n\nSince people seem unable to accept Corbyn's links with various anti-Western or anti-UK groups, please see this [list](https://order-order.com/2017/06/08/100-times-jeremy-corbyn-sided-terrorists/). Yes, it's from Guido Fawkes, but there's a wide enough variety of sources that even the greatest of his fans must admit that he has lined up with plenty of deplorables throughout his career.\n\nThe central point of Corbyn's foreign policy is an imperial cringe, which leads him to back all sorts of wrong'uns. Many of these groups explicitly support violence in pursuit of their political objectives, so it's dubious whether Corbyn can really call himself a pacifist.\n\nEven if you deny that, pacifism is plainly immoral. Violence is at the centre of the rule of law, and indeed pursuit of human rights. Without violence in the form of restraint or coercion, there is no law.",

    "body": "> He'll condemn bombings but not the organisation\n\nAnd rightly so. One doesn't make much headway in peace talks if one has repeatedly condemned the organisation in question. There's not much point in doing that anyway: it's all rhetorical. The violence is the thing that's bad about the IRA; remove it and you've got a legitimate protest party (like Sinn Fein).\n\n>He refuses to sing the national anthem\n\nLol. So? I refuse to fly the Butcher's Apron outside my house because I don't like what it stands for. I don't much like the national anthem either. Does that make me a bad person? Does it make me unpatriotic? Nope. It just means that I dislike what particular symbols say about our country. I would prefer others. It means that I have a different idea about what we should be proud of in this country. I'm proud of the NHS, of the welfare state, of our history of inclusiveness. I'd back a symbol that represented any of those any day. And if your best criterion for judging whether someone would make a good Prime Minister is whether they sing the national anthem then I feel that you need to reevaluate your own assessment methods.\n\n>Sorry, not people, but kids.\n\n[Not really.](https://twitter.com/rhodri_jones/status/873862522792796160) In fact there's every reason to believe that a substantial proportion of people even in the 55+ category want him to be PM. I know that my mother - a 65 year old senior doctor, with an MBE - and my father - another senior doctor, who spends his retirement doing health tribunals - both believe that Corbyn is the right man for the job. Heck, even my 92 year old grandmother who is a staunch Tory and loved Theresa May told me the day after the election that Corbyn is 'warming on' her ",

It happened to say \"Jeremy Corbyn defends fighters returning from Syria.\"\n\nThis is the quote directly from the Guido website which it somehow interpreted as \"defending terrorists\"\n\n> \"I feel that we should think about this rather more carefully and avoid the knee-jerk reaction of saying, \u201cThese are bad fighters and those are good fighters, so we will ban these and allow those in\u2026 I have encountered young people who have been attracted to what ISIS is doing. They say that what the West did in Iraq and Afghanistan was appalling, and was questionably legal in the case of Afghanistan and definitely illegal in the case of Iraq. We are living with the consequences of the war on terror of 2001, and if we continue to try to create legal obstacles and make value judgments about people without considering the overall policy we are following, we will return to legislation such as this again and again, year after year.\u201d*\n\n> **\u201cI have no support for ISIS whatsoever, and obviously [measures] should apply to someone who has committed crimes**, but we should bear in mind that expressing a political point of view is not in itself an offence. The commission of a criminal act is clearly a different matter, but expressing a point of view, even an unpalatable one, is sometimes quite important in a democracy. We should be slightly cautious about announcing that we will start to deal with people on the basis of a general view that they have expressed. We should think seriously about where our foreign policy has brought us, and what our legislative position now is.\u201d\n\nOh look at that. In context it actually seems perfectly reasonable, nuanced point of view and is not at all defending terrorists or ISIS. If you're going to take words out of context why don't you take the ones where he in fact he explicitly says people who have committed crime should face consequences. It couldn't be because Guido has an agenda could it? \n\nAnd this is from Guido's own website, I bet if I actually looked into the even more broader context from a non-biased website it would seem even more reasonable. \n\nThe point is there's no way you can characterise what he said as \"defending terrorists\" unless you are purposefully being obtuse and thick-minded and explicitly trying to read that into it from the outset. In which case you're just an ass. \n",

No one, ever, can change the past. \n\nSure, it's idealism, possibly even naivete, but if everyone practised it the world would actually be a much nicer place. I can't fault someone for being forgiving. \n\nThen again, ask me that again if that forgiveness leads to the death of people I love, I suppose, which is the fear behind ideology - that it will ultimately get you or the people you love hurt.",

If you say \"Do you condemn ISIS?\" and the first word of the response is not \"yes\", what are you going to think, how would you react, and how is that going to colour subsequent answers?

We wanted him to win, though no one could say what winning would be, till we stopped picking sides, treated them equally and got a peace agreement.\n\nI just don't buy this attempt to single out one side from the other when peace is what's important. It's just a way of getting back to divisive politics, which only helps divide and rule tactics, which is not what we want in NI.\n\nI mean, the side we were fighting for all those years just walked away from a \u00a3500 million fraud. It was felt best that we did not dwell on that in order not to disturb the peace process.\n\nWhy on earth is it even remotely responsible to try and get a senior politician to disturb the peace process by saying words that would be flaunted by some people to create a bit more division in an already unstable region?\n\nGotta say, you're really not living up to your flair with this comment. How is it egalitarian or liberal to try and whip up some division rather than accept an even-handed approach to the historical situation? As for anti-authoritarian, you're repeating what the most establishment people have harrumphed for years because they like stirring up trouble so that liberal egalitarianism doesn't have a chance to gain any hold in people's lives.\n\nYou're right, the two statements are not the same.

It is abhorrent. But you fail to acknowledge recent context about Hamas charter. Firstly, it was created during the violence of the first intifada.\nThe charter has always been used an excuse by Israelis, not to talk to Hamas. Even though it has been quoted 'relic of history' by subsequent Hamas leaders. Even if Hamas managed to change its charter, I still believe its prior incarnation would be used as an excuse not to talk about peace. Hamas has softened its stance in recent years vis a vis accepting a Palestinian state within the borders of 1967 (effectively accepting the existence of Israel).\n\nLet's also remember Israel supported the precursor to Hamas, [Mujama Al-Islamiya](https://web.archive.org/web/20090926212507/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB123275572295011847.html). Many believe it was a way to create a rival and weaken Fatah, which dominated Palestinian politics at the time.\n\nHamas was elected by the Palestinian after Israel murdered Yasser Arafat in his compound, destroyed Fatah's party political infrastructure, effectively handing the election to Hamas. Which ended up giving them control over the Gaza strip. \n\nLet's also remember Israel murdered Hamas' blind and disabled cleric and used [white phosphorus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_phosphorus_munitions#Gaza_War_.282008.E2.80.932009.29) on Gazan civilians.\n\nWe can go on and on. Talking about the litany of crimes done and how intractable it is on BOTH sides. Doesn't mean you shouldn't talk if you have someone to talk to. Why is it Fatah is somehow acceptable after their military committed acts of terror? But not Hamas? They were, and still is, a litany of crimes between Republicans and Unionists, but that doesn't mean they shouldn't talk to each other.",

It isn't just meeting with Sinn Fein and his support of a United Ireland despite the majority having been against it for decades, it's his protesting at trials of terrorists like the Brighton Bomber, it's attending events honoring fallen IRA terrorists, it's the fact that despite this supposedly being justified with talk of it being about peaceful negotiation (even though I don't think that applies to the latter charges), he didn't to my knowledge do the same with the UVF or Red Hand Commandos and the like. Why? I think it's pretty clear why, it's because he did have clear sympathy for the IRA and their cause. Some fellow Corbynistas attempt to turn this argument into the idea that his opponents are saying he directly supported attacking British civilians, which is something different altogether and something I haven't personally seen anyone suggesting.",

Personally I feel context is important.\n* [Ken Livingstone](http://www.haaretz.com/world-news/europe/.premium-1.782242?v=E7BE67A431C2E80FB3DC1459C6F9A4DC) - who repeated the myth that Hitler supported zionism. In my opinion horrifically misjudged, but, as Hareetz puts it:\n\n> Livingstone, even in his dotage, is no anti-Semite in any traditional sense. He once had strong ties with many Jewish groups in London...The key to his peculiar brand of the ancient hatred can be found in the claim he has repeated over the past year that in all his decades of Labour Party activism he has never come across a single instance of anti-Semitism. Given the circles he has traveled in all his political life, this can only mean that for Livingstone, bias against Jews in a left-wing setting is simply inconceivable.\n\nI worry about the precedent that sets. If a person claims they haven't personally encountered anti-semitism, they must be lying and therefore anti-semitic? Still, Livingstone has been suspended since last April, with a full enquiry underway. I'm not sure what else is expected of them? A full internal review of the entire party, based on one member? That sounds a little too much like a witch hunt to me. The implication seems to be they are anti-semitic until proven innocent, which again sets a very dangerous precedent.",

Do you reckon Jeremy was playing the 20 year long game and thought \"if I pretend like I'm in the peace process now, I can go for the party leadership later and trick the electorate\", rather than just actually being part of the peace process. The only things I've seen that even come close to saying that Corbyn wasn't a part of the peace process seem to think he's suggesting he was a key player, which I've never seen him say. He always is acting as a spokes person for labour saying that the peace process that the Labour Party worked on was a great success",

Also, Israel isn't the only one holding a blockade of the territory.  Egypt also does, and Egypt is far more severe about its side of the blockade than Israel is.  Egypt basically leaves Gazans to rot.\n\nIt's Israel that feeds and clothes Gazans through the Kerem Shalom crossing every day.  It's Israel that makes sure that Gazans are not starving to death.  I think Israel is too indulgent of Gazans, and that pressure should be put on them to renounce their extremist worldview.  The elected government of Gaza will not even pay the bills!\n\n> I have read the charter.\n\nOh, good.  These are Corbyn's \"friends\".\n\nAlso, Hezbollah, who said in 1992:\n\n> *\"It is an open war until the elimination of Israel and until the death of the last Jew on earth.\"*\n\nNice people.\n\nThey can burn in Hell.\n\n> Firstly, it was created during the violence of the first intifada.\n\nYou mean they created it during a time when they were, erm, murdering and bombing Israelis?\n\n>  Even though it has been quoted 'relic of history' by subsequent Hamas leaders.\n\nThey have never disavowed the Charter.  They are proud of it.\n\n> Even if Hamas managed to change its charter, I still believe its prior incarnation would be used as an excuse not to talk about peace.\n\nIf I were Israel, I wouldn't trust genocidal antisemites either.\n\nHamas needs to completely disappear from the face of the Earth.  As do all the present Palestinian factions, because none of them promote peace, tolerance and coexistence.  They all either have their own terrorist organisations, or support terrorism.  In fact, the few Palestinians that *do* promote coexistence and peace with Jews have to keep such a fact secret, otherwise they could be murdered for Zionist sympathies.\n\n> Hamas has softened its stance in recent years vis a vis accepting a Palestinian state within the borders of 1967 (effectively accepting the existence of Israel).\n\nUntil they can destroy Israel, that is.\n\nMay I quote the Charter again?\n\n> *\"Israel will exist and will continue to exist until Islam will obliterate it, just as it obliterated others before it\"\"\n\nThey make gestures of peace in English to gullible Westerners, but read their statements in Arabic to their real audience.  They're so extreme that even other Arabs are beginning to really hate them these days.\n\nIf Hamas were given the West Bank and Gaza, they would not recognise Israel.  They would use the new territory as a staging post to finish Israel off.\n\nIsraelis aren't stupid.  They may be many things, but they are not stupid.\n\n> Hamas was elected by the Palestinian after Israel murdered Yasser Arafat in his compound\n\nThis is an anti-Israel libel spread by the Palestinian Authority.  More than likely, it was someone close to him.  I don't see what Israel would have to gain by murdering Arafat.\n\nAlso, it connects rather nicely with the idea that Jews poisoned Muhammad, no?\n\n> Let's also remember Israel murdered Hamas' blind and disabled cleric\n\nAnd also founder and spiritual leader.\n\nI'm not terribly bothered about it.  He was a senior figure in Hamas, known as the \"Palestinian Bin Laden\".  You are a senior member of a terror organisation that wants to wipe out Jews, don't be surprised when you get your comeuppance.\n\nOh, and Hamas loved the guy so much [they opened up a terror shrine to him](http://elderofziyon.blogspot.com/2011/05/hamas-opening-terror-shrine.html).\n\n> Why is it Fatah is somehow acceptable after their military committed acts of terror?\n\nI don't think Fatah *is* acceptable.  They share the same ideology as Hamas, but they are slightly more savvy about appearing moderate to gullible Westerners.\n\n> They were, and still is, a litany of crimes between Republicans and Unionists, but that doesn't mean they shouldn't talk to each other.\n\nThe IRA movement, as evil as it was, did not and do not want to murder all the Protestants in Northern Ireland.  They did not set out a Charter calling for the death of every British person on Earth, the annexing of Britain to Ireland and its repopulating with Irish people.  The Unionists did not advocate the murder of every Irish person on Earth (they were and are Irish!) and the retaking of the island of Ireland.\n\nThe problem I have with the Palestinian terrorist organisations is that they do not, fundamentally, believe in reason in the way that normal people see it.  For them, it is the continuation of the war on Jews since Muhammad's time.",

It's like saying \"if you can't understand why Trump's comments about Mexico and Mexicans offended Mexicans and cost him Mexican American votes, try substituting your own country and nationality and see if you can then understand the offence it caused\".\n\nBut to address your \"the IRA are heroes\" comment, if you are serious and not trolling I'm going to guess that you do not live in Britain or Ireland as very few people who live there would write that in 2017 without including clarifications and caveats to define exactly to what they referring. If that is correct (you're not from Britain or Ireland), and/or you are interested in knowing more about why people in Ireland and Britain tend to have a less romanticised view of the modern IRA(s) than people in say Boston or Chicago or the internet, then these two questions give a good overview on how attitudes to the IRA have evolved for people in the Republic of Ireland over time (and of course in the UK where Corbyn was standing, attitudes tend to be even harder, especially amongst those who were alive at the time):\n\n* [Quora- Did The Republic of Ireland support the IRA?](https://www.quora.com/Did-The-Republic-of-Ireland-support-the-IRA)\n\n* [Yahoo Answers -Why dont you guys in the republic of ireland support the IRA?](https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20110617065631AATCw83)",

There is a wealth of historical record putting Corbyn at rallies supporting IRA terrorists including the man who tried to blow up the government, meetings calling for the bomb and bullet as the only way of bringing about a united Ireland,  events where he sat on platform with bombers and butchers even though he claimed never to have met with members of the IRA. \n\nAny decent person who wanted to support a United Ireland had a massive moral and upstanding group they could join in the SDLP, Corbyn and his friends did not do that and instead justified the violence of the IRA, called for the immediate dismantling of the police and security forces in Northern Ireland and commemorated the deaths of bombers and gunmen. Nothing Corbyn and his friends did contributed to the peace process, if anything they made things worse by giving the bombers and the people who  backed them false political legitimacy, and if what they called for had happened there would have been ten times as much blood, maimings and death.",

It does not condemn either the IRA of the UVF.\n\n**Let's look at a parallel situation:**\n\n1) The Conservative Party carries out electoral fraud, campaigning, standing for election, etc. \n\n2) The Labour Party carries out electoral fraud, campaigning, standing for election, etc. \n\n3) I condemn all acts of electoral fraud.\n\nSo, in this case, have I condemned electoral fraud, or have I condemned the Conservative Party?

I also haven't condemned *all* acts carried out by the Conservative party, because I haven't condemned 'campaigning' or 'standing for election'.\n\nI can't put this any plainer, I'm afraid.

I wonder why?\n\nBecause he was implementing social programmes which improved many peoples lives.\n\n'[When he assumed the presidency in 1998, Hugo Ch\u00e1vez launched his so-called \u201cRevoluci\u00f3n bolivariana,\u201d making sweeping changes to the cultural, social, and political norms of Venezuela. These changes began with his attention to Venezuela\u2019s lower classes. Under Ch\u00e1vez, Venezuela expanded low-income housing, made healthcare and medicine accessible to much of the population, and subsidized food distribution for those in need. These programs, especially in rural areas, made social services and government jobs available to large swaths of the population, resulting in a drop in the poverty rate from 48.6 percent in 2002 to 29.5 percent in 2011. The infant mortality rate also declined while literacy rates and access to free public education increased, according to data aggregated by Index Mundi. As Harvard professor Steve Levitsky explained to the HPR, \u201cCh\u00e1vez took social policies seriously. Even with cronyism, corruption, and inefficiency, he implemented policies that truly helped the poor.\u201d](http://harvardpolitics.com/world/the-legacy-of-hugo-chavez/)'\n\n>Just to be clear, we mean the people who are starving and rioting right now? Or can everyone afford prophylactics yet?\n\nJust be clear again, Chevez died in 2013.\n\n>The ones who had horrific lack of core human rights?\n\nYes, those ones. I never claimed Chavez was a perfect human being, I said he did a lot of good for the poor which he quite clearly did. Why should he not be praised for that? That is documented historical fact.\n\n>It's undeniable there was a short period where things got better but the wrting was on the wall by 2013.\n\nIn other words, Venezuela got a lot better under Chavez and got worse when he died.",

He was a sweet old man who never harmed a fly and who always believed in peace.  When I found out for myself who he actually was, you suddenly don't want to talk about it.\n\nAs I said, you might as well get me to feel sorry for the killing by Israel of Ahmed Jabari or Mazen Fuqaha - literally the leader of Hamas' armed wing.  Do you want me to feel sorry for Israel killing these people too?\n\nIt's like getting me to feel upset if Anjem Choudary was killed if he was actively involved in a terror organisation that kills Brits.\n\n> Even when they negotiate with the PLO, they actively stall, provide no concessions\n\nIsrael provides endless concessions to the PLO.  They take them and say \"thank you very much, Israel!\"  They have done for many years.\n\nThere have been different forms of Israeli government, both right and left.  Even the most dovish, left-wing Israeli government could not bring peace.  Endless Israeli leaders (Haim, Ramon, Sharon, Olmert, Barak, Peres) have made it clear that they are willing to make painful concessions for peace by Israel.  The PA and Abbas have given the Israelis zilch.  After every concession by Israel, the Palestinians have come back with more demands.\n\nOne of the major Palestinian Authority demands to Israel is the \"right of return\", and Abbas regularly talks about it in Arab media.  They are considered to be a central part of the wishlist of the Palestinian Authority, as much as the idea of a state on the 1967 borders.\n\nDo you know what \"right of return\" actually means?  It's code again for one thing: the destruction of Israel.  They tell their people that part of a deal with Israel will include the destruction of Israel, by flooding the Jewish state with millions of Arabs.\n\n> Pretending to talk about a supposed peace, but murdering people and expanding settlements at the same time. \n\nI've seen what \"expanding settlements\" actually means.  It means building an extra house or two in a settlement bloc near the Green Line.\n\nAs for \"murdering people\"?  Like whom?  Is it people like Ahmed Yassin, Ahmed Jabari and other terrorists?\n\nIf an Israeli Jew murders an Arab or a Palestinian, he will go to jail for a very long time.  Look at the uproar there was when an Israeli soldier killed an injured Palestinian terrorist recently.\n\nWhen a Palestinian Arab murders an Israeli Jew... what happens?\n\nThat's the crucial difference between Israel and the Palestinians.  One side promotes peace, tolerance, coexistence and love of life - there are children's shows with Arab and Jewish kids, where they talk about their hopes for the future; the other side extols violence, hatred, supremacism, Islamic terrorism, homophobia, Jew-hatred, misogyny, martyrdom, etc etc.\n\nInterestingly, I once spoke to an Arab Muslim (who himself wants Israel to not exist).  I showed him clips from Palestinian and Arab TV where they call for Muslims to kill Jews for Allah.  Arabs and Muslims often say that the translation does not reflect the content of what is actually said.  He told me: \"MEMRI's translation of the footage is more or less completely correct.  MEMRI may be Zionists, but they aren't telling lies.\"\n\n> The fact is Israel was born of war\n\nIt didn't have to be.  Israel did not offer violence at its founding.  It was the Arab armies that went to war with Israel in 1948 in order to destroy it.  The new Israeli state literally was fighting for its very survival.  If they had lost, it probably would have meant a second Holocaust in the Middle East.",
