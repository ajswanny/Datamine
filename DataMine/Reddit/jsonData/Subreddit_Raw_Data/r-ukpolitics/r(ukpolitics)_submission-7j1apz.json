Our 'Jihadi Johns'. \n\nA few experts had to bring up the inbreeding issue and talk about what could be significantly lower-IQs. It turns out, Low IQ can also make some young people highly vulnerable to suggestion, easily influenced and lured, seduced etc. It had been suggested that this could be part of the explanation for the recruitment successes. \n\nEither way, its a very real problem. It's actually a significant problem in some predominantly Muslim middle-eastern countries but it can become very serious when they are put in enclave abroad. \n\nOther groups are in similar positions like for example Jews in New York who are part of the strict adherence groups. But, they seemed to avoid it by having just 1 wife rules and then they seem to keep very careful genealogy and then import/export matches carefully. Likewise, Mormons actually can have 4 wives but avoided it by keeping extremely strict genealogy which allowed them to make sure cousins aren't marrying cousins. \n\nBut if you care about people, care about minorities and care about Muslims you won't help them much by laughing at 'Britain First' people when instead you should be trying to solve the Muslim Inbreeding problem in the UK. Because THAT will definitely hurt Muslims more than anything!",
