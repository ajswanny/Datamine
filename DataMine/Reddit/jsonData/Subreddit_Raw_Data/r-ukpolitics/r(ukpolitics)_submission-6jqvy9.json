The supporting party won't do this out of the goodness of their hearts; they need an incentive and their constituents would expect them to get something out of the situation. Much of what the government does involves allocating and spending the income from taxes so deals between parties will have some sort of financial component \u2013 either explicitly giving money for a particular purpose, or agreeing on policies which later have to be backed up with budget allocations.\n\nThat's how deals work between parties. That's how politics in general works. Lots of campaigning in the election was about promising blocks of voters that money would be spent on things which benefit them. I suspect what people are upset about isn't the allocation of money (that's normal politics), but rather the identity of the parties that benefit. Lots of people hate the Tories, so they wouldn't want a deal to be reached. Lots of people dislike the views of the DUP (or what they've been told about them), so they don't want them to benefit.\n\nIf it was instead Labour and the Lim Dems making a deal which involved spending billions of reducing tuition fees then I suspect many of the shrill voices would be quite happy.",

Whether you folk on the mainland realize it or not, Northern Ireland is part of your society. And the money is going to do exactly what you say it isn't. NI people pay taxes!!! It's their money too. \n\nNI has been overlooked by the UK government for fucking decades. NI has the worst unemployment rate in the UK. EU funding helped NI get its shit together a bit. And then thanks to mainland England and Brexit they lost that too \ud83d\ude02 \n\nWhilst you may not agree with how this money was handed over, it absolutely is going to improve roads, NHS services and education in NI...",

Very odd.\n\nI think the outrage is they are seemingly doing both, along with May's claims of magic money trees. That money wasn't the only thing the DUP got, they've undone some of Tory's policies (admittedly some of the more unpopular ones, so for now its a good thing but could easily turn into a bad one) and this isn't a one off thing. DUP haven't agreed to back everything and this money sets a precedent. I think what people are really worried about isn't just the payout, it's what it means for the future. What are the DUP's next demands. If May is willing to chuck them \u00a31bn that her own narrative claims we don't have, then what next.\n\nNI getting money isn't the bad thing, NI being shown favouritism is. Scotland and Wales are already upset. Ireland aren't happy about it either and the situation in Ireland was already dire to begin with. The other problem is where is this money coming from? Labour claimed theirs was through the reversing of the corp tax cut mostly. Tories aren't planning on doing that as far as I am aware, so that money is either going to be an increase in taxes or pulled from budgets elsewhere. Budgets that are already dire to begin with. What are we going to agree to next time we need the DUP to agree, when the public wont stand the idea of another tax rise, or funding being pulled out of sectors that need it. This is only the start, DUP get more and more power as we go.\n\nThat's my problem with it anyway. I am by no means an expert on these matters though.",

If they can magically find money for NI then the rest of us can have increased public funding too. If we really are as hard up as a nation as the conservatives continually claim then they should have more cuts in NI and take it like the rest of us have to. \n\nAnd yes I agree that the DUP have a shit reputation. The only bright side with that side though is they'll be under much greater media scrutiny, so hopefully they'll either be caught sooner or the fear of getting caught will make them think twice.",

The alternative is probably another general election which they might lose outright. This deal gets them something that looks a bit like a workable majority and she gets to pass whatever legislation she would like for the next 5 years.\n\nI would like to hope though that we could expect rather more from our leaders than clinging on to power at any cost. This election (and the other recent elections) has shown a fundamental weakness in our electoral and governmental systems. First past the post does tend to produce single party majority governments but it also leads to those parties gaming the system, rewarding the groups that vote for them and ignoring the ones that don't. All the parties are guilty of playing the game to a greater or lesser extent but recently I feel the Tories have been going too far and it's split the country. May is now taking the game playing to a whole new level by using tax payers money to buy the DUP votes and force through legislation that only about half the country wants.\n\nWe have a long history of government through compromise, it feels like we've forgotten why that was a good thing. With the country as split as it is at the moment we shouldn't be making big decisions. We need to collectively take a step back, make friends again and then decide what the best way forward for all of us is.\n\nAnd if I was in charge, I'd move us over to some form of proportional representation. That would produce a parliament that better represented the feelings of the people and would mean the parties wold be used to forming coalitions that had to work together.\n",

May could just about rule without a deal with the DUP as a minority government, but she would be gambling that the DUP would either abstain or vote with her on every important vote which is not very strong and stable.
