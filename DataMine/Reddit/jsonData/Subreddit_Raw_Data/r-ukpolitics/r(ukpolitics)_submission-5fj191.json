The people that didn't vote for Hillary didn't see that story about the Pope, nor were they swayed by it. This \"Fake News\" discussion is face-saving, probably mostly unconsciously as they seek to blame everything but themselves. Their over-confidence alone probably cost them a few points with people being uninspired to go stand in a queue for about an hour (like, WTF America?) to vote for what they were told was a sure thing. \n\nThose of us with longer memories may remember Bush/Gore where the R's were slated at every opportunity for them putting forward Bush II. To try the same shtick just a decade or so later with Clinton II was just insane. They did it to themselves. Hell, they even had their friendly media outlets focus on Trump purposely, thinking him as an *outsider* would poison the Republican campaign. They fucked up real good by trying the usual \"shit on your opponent\" US election crap against someone with no boundaries, morals or qualms about saying any old shit in response.

If news stations are just blindly copying each other without checking the facts for themselves then they are just as bad as those who make up the news in the first place. \n\nMany pro-trump sources claimed that the polls were wrong and gave a lot of evidence to back up their claims such as over sampling and pollsters bias. Trump even stood in front of a crowd of tens of thousands of his supporters and asked them if any of them had been polled? Silence. Why weren't Trump supporters being polled? \n\nInstead of taking these claims seriously they were branded 'fake news' and dismissed and even banned from certain subreddits. When it turns out they were right, no apologies were given and Fake news was instead doubly blamed even though we can see that some of the supposed 'fake news' was correct. A good journalistic news source would take arguements from both sides and give a balances response. A good journalistic news source would be sceptical and always challenging the consensus instead of blinding following and lastly a good journalistic news sources does it's own research and comes to a correct assumption and the assumption that most fits their bias.\n\n Huffington post is not a good news source. \n\n",

Puts a lot on paper that I've been seeing IRL and reddit lately on a whole range of subjects. \n\n>  I mean if the people, the quotes, the places, the names, the dates, the statistics and the responses are all made up any way, then why not have a made-up publication print the story in the first place?\n\nI've seen them go further than that. One of the newer round of fakes I saw threw me for a minute due to a sneaky URL, it looked like a legit site but the interesting thing was that about halfway through the story devolved into random gibberish, looked a bit autogenerated e.g. markov algorithm. At first I thought they were maybe hacked or it was some in-page url re-direction thing to external content until the penny dropped and I noticed the URL. All of the stories were like that, headline, bold leader, one or two paras then 21st century lorem ipsum. \n\nOn a related note, we got a classic popping up on /r/Scotland  recently, the old \"broke down, fell in love with the place, moved here\" tabloid shitpost, [this time with Tom Cruise](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scotland/comments/5f1whq/tom_cruise_contemplates_move_to_inverness/).
