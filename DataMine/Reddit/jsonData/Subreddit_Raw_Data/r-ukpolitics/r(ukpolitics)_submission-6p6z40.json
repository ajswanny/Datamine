Hence the small time people are out of work between jobs, which may exist even in full employment (depending on your definition) ought not to be counted. Anyway, a debate over how unemployment should be defined and measured is great, and it is happening in academia all the time.

People who ahve given up looking for work can count as either 'taking time off' or as housewives/husbands. These types of people do not need to be included in the figures. Including them artificially increases the unemployment rate.\n\n>Wages in the private sector have not started to rise. Public-sector wage rises are capped at 1%. There has been a little uptick in new-hire rates, but the overall trend is flat. This is part of the proof that shows real unemployment can't be just 4.5%:\n\nThis is not proof that unemployment is not at 4.5%. There are many economical reason why wages havent increased. Also, looking at wage increases in general when saying they havent increased is dishonest. In skilled work, wages have been increasing, and at a rather rapid rate. I work in IT, and at my previous job I got a 5% pay increase 3 years running.\n\nEngineering, Science, maths, history, geography, Tech/IT and other academic and technical sectors are seeing wage rises. Some of those rises are large and/or rapid. However, not everyone is a worker in those sectors, and many sectors are seeing minor wage increases, stagnant wage increase or even wage decrease.\n\nLooking at public sector pay as evidence is also misleading and dishonest, as public pay is dependent on the amount of money the Government has to spend on pay. The government isnt going to give large pay increases when it cant afford to do so. Every pay increase for public sector workers means less money for other things.\n\n>In reality, about 21.5% of British workers are either officially unemployed, inactive, or employed part time even though they really want full-time work\n\nThere is no source for this figure. Also, inactive people need to be taken out of the equation as their either dont want a job, or have a 'job' as a housewife/househusband, carer for a family member or they are otherwise indisposed. Also, part time employment means someone is not unemployed. Unemployed means they are without a job even though they want one. If someone is working part time, they are not unemployed.\n\n>parents with newborns, university students\n\nWhy are they including people in full time education and people on maternity/paternity leave as 'unemployed'? This is wrong and skews the figures. Its almost like business insider is trying to push a narrative....\n\nThe article then shows a chart that proves that the unemployment rate is in fact at 4.5%. It only gets as high as they claim if you include part time workers (who due to the fact they are *part time WORKERS*, are not unemployed) and people who are inactive yet 'want a job'. If they are inactive, they arent looking for work or they are doing something else instead of working. So they can be discarded as they are for all intents and purposes outside of the system.\n\nSo the unemployment rate is in fact 4.5%.\n\n",

    "body": "TFA is using the statistics unsoundly IMO. From TFA:\n\n> In reality, about 21.5% of British workers are either officially unemployed, inactive, or employed part-time even though they really want full-time work. (The ONS has a chapter on that here.) Some of those people \u2014 parents with newborns, university students \u2014 may not want jobs right now, but they will want jobs soon.\n\nScroll down through the ONS statistics they cite and you'll find of 8.8m ``inactive'' people:\n\n  * 2.29m are students\n  * 2.17m are home-makers\n  * 1.99m are ``long term ill''\n  * 1.22m are retired\n\nAccording to TFA's assumptions they'll ``want jobs soon'', however\n\n * When one generation of students graduate, another starts.\n * Similarly, home-makers roll over time.\n * Those retired explicitly aren't seeking work.\n\nSo while the specific people will want work, it's not true that within a few years no-one will be a student / home-maker / retired, and so it's unfair to consider them all ``hidden unemployed'' IMO. That leaves long-term ill, which is more difficult to judge, particularly as there is government pressure to get people off it.\n\nFinally there's the question of their graph, citing from ``Pantheon Macroeconomics'', which states roughly 6.5% of the population are inactive but would like a job. Presumably that's roughly a quarter of the people in those categories above. I think [this](http://www.pantheonmacro.com/cmsfiles/pantheon/docs/Samples/UK_Chartbook_1115.pdf) might be part of the source (see graph 24), but I would be hesitant to draw conclusions from that without knowing sample sizes and the actual question asked. Perhaps business insider have access to more information.\n\nIt's probably fair to say that many part time employees want more work, and many inactive might work if they could. But none of them are liquid assets, as it were, in that they can't immediately relocate and start an arbitrary job if they were offered one. Measuring that difference is what TFA dances around.\n\nEdits: lots.\n\nEdit 2: Cited graph from Pantheon shows no apparent effect of the credit crunch on \"inactive, would like job\" (note their right-hand scale isn't zero based), which pushes me further towards ``TFA is rubbish'' territory.",

If the company has already given away all its profits in pay rises, then the workers could just refuse to work any extra.\n\nIts a liquidity issue, the companies that my employer uses occasionally has these problems.

So I stopped claiming JSA.\n\nOn paper, I was no longer \"actively seeking work\" so case closed. Another success story for JSA! I had never been at a lower point in my life.

You'd get on, sign a form reserving your spot and that you consent to be charged \u00a35 from your salary for the 10-15 mile trip, and you're on your way.\n\nThose days didn't happen very often. The bus could be late, sometimes more than an hour, and when it did arrive there would be a good chance there is not enough spaces. In which case you'd wait for another hour or so as it makes the round trip. Sometimes they'd just send you home.\n\nIt wasn't unusual for the warehouse to just not have enough for work for the agency people once they arrived. I've worked many \"shifts\" where I did 2 hours of work, which at minimum wage barely covered the \u00a35 you'd pay the agency for transport, and I'd get sent home again.\n\nThe bus service was horrendously unreliable. I'd say there is a 1 in 3 chance we'd have to wait for over an hour for the bus to arrive at the end of the day (the most I waited was about 2.5 hours). \n\nThe work itself was very hard and somewhat degrading. I don't think English people quiet appreciate how shitty warehouse work is in England. I was handling returned clothing items. We were told to look over the items in search for signs of wear and damage, as well as to smell them for body odour and deodorant. Mostly dresses and underwear. You'd spend the entire shift on your legs working towards really high targets. No one there, even people who have done this job for years, could feasibly take breather or distract themselves with chatter to alleviate the skull-pounding boredom or they'd start missing targets and have a supervisor asking why. It's both mentally and physically exhausting.\n \nI know for a fact there are worse warehouses than that one to work in. I also get there might be harder jobs out there, but the ones I can think of don't leave you with a pay-cheque that doesn't cover basic needs. They'd give you the satisfaction of creating something or being a part of a productive team.  Warehouse workers are machines and they know it.\n\nAs for the \"foreigner stealing our work\" argument? I've worked for 3 warehouses in my life, which combined employed people in tens of thousands. I'd say approximately one in thirty were from the UK and hardly any lasted long.",

You don't use the NHS, or send your kids to state schools?  Ok, but you live in a country where neither the state, nor the populace driven to desperation rip you out of your bed in the dark of night and take everything from you.\n\nIf you don't share some fragment of the wealth, eventually the poor will become desperate enough to, if not eat the rich, then to even the score.\n\nAnd, even without going too far down that rather bleak path, if you actually earned your wealth, rather than merely inherited it, you benefited from a workforce educated and kept fit, by the state and operated within its infrastructure.\n\nI have a lot of fondness for this quote from Elizabeth Warren, which would later be reworked into Obama's famous, \"You didn't build that!\" speech:\n\n>\u201cThere is nobody in this country who got rich on their own. Nobody. You built a factory out there - good for you. But I want to be clear. You moved your goods to market on roads the rest of us paid for. You hired workers the rest of us paid to educate. You were safe in your factory because of police forces and fire forces that the rest of us paid for. You didn't have to worry that marauding bands would come and seize everything at your factory... Now look. You built a factory and it turned into something terrific or a great idea - God bless! Keep a hunk of it.

    "body": "Disclaimer: American\n\nI agree with the social aspects of Libertarianism as I feel it's the closest political ideology to *classical* liberalism.\n\nThe economic policies, however, are a chaotic mess. You can usually end up ending a conversation with an ardent Libertarian by simply asking them if they use the roads (all US roads are public for the most part) and if they'd enjoy paying a toll instead of subsidizing them with tax money. Bearing in mind all goods (that are transported by 18-wheelers) would be inordinately expensive due to higher cost of transport. \n\nThere is a fitting saying: A lone wolf dies, a wolfpack survives. We're at a state in technological advance that simply requires some level of government centralization and history has proven again and again that, if left alone, private companies will end up destroying not only themselves but the surrounding environment. What US coal companies did to the Appalachians and the people that lived there is proof positive of that. ",

If they'd offered overtime, this wouldn't be a problem.\n\nIts easy to say that liquidity isn't an issue, but it was only a a decade ago that the credit crunch came about and thousands of otherwise viable firms went to the wall because banks called in their loans or wouldn't release new loans, and all the businesses that didn't have cash reserves on hand to pay suppliers and their staff went bust.\n\nI was there, I saw it happen, I lost my job.

    "body": "> I don't think the figures I quoted includes pension spending!\n\nYour \u00a3111bn is broken down as follows:\n\nWelfare\t113.6\t    \nFamily and children (CKSFC)\t15.7\t    \nUnemployment (CKSUE)\t2.7\t    \nemployment policies (capital) (LCEEP)\t0.0\t    \nHousing (CKSHO)\t0.6\t    \nHousing Revenue Account (PCCHR)\t2.6\t    \nNorthern Ireland Housing Executive (PCNHE)\t-0.0\t    \nHousing Revenue Account (PCSHR)\t0.6\t    \nWales Housing Revenue Account (PCWHR)\t0.2    \nSocial exclusion n.e.c (CKSSE)\t31.6\t    \nR&D social protection (CKSRD)\t0.0\t    \nSocial protection n.e.c. (CKSNE)\t4.0\t    \nSocial protection (capital) (LCSOP)\t0.2\t    \nSocial protection (current) (LKSOP)\t55.5\t\n\nSo, this tells us that almost the whole of the spend is on three areas:\n\nFamily and children (CKSFC)\t15.7\t\nSocial exclusion n.e.c (CKSSE)\t31.6\t\nSocial protection (current) (LKSOP)\t55.5\t\n\nFamily and children seems sufficiently self-explanatory, but Social exclusion and Social protection eat \u00a387/111bn.  \n\n**[This](http://www.economicshelp.org/blog/12164/economics/benefit-spending-in-the-uk/)** states that, \"Secondly, by far the biggest level of social protection spending is pension spending. This includes both state pension payments and (I believe) state occupational pensions to retired public sector workers.\" and subsequently also shows:\n\n>The HM Treasury actually split \u2018income support benefits\u2019 into two different groups.\n\n>They have sections for: \n\n>10.4 Family and Children (\u00a324bn)    \n>\u2013 Income support, tax credits\n\n>10.7 Social exclusion (\u00a329bn)    \n>\u2013 Income support, tax credits\n\nThis is purely speculation on my part, but I might hazard a guess that the Social Exclusion piece is Pension Credit.  (A benefit given to pensioners to top up their pension income.)\n\nSo, in short, it looks like the majority of welfare spending is going to pensioners.  The next largest chunk then goes on topping up people's incomes.\n\nEdit:  Tidied up the spending figures, which turned to gibberish.",

If because of the overtime, the cost of the labour has increased, like if the supplier is offering time-and-half or double-time to his staff, that doesn't affect how much I'm going to pay for the parts. I just pay for the quantity, their staffing arrangements don't concern me.\n\nIn contracts like this, there is a bit of flexibility in terms of calling up orders sooner than originally requested. For example if our customer has made the mistake and needs stuff earlier, and we can't supply in time, then the customer might go away and find another supplier who can meet his time scales, so we would lose the business, and our supplier would lose the business too.\n\nWe're an ethical business, we like to share profits and savings with our suppliers so that each part of the supply chain makes enough profit margin to be able to handle me cocking up and forgetting to order stuff.",

Jobseekers -- who are typically the ones demonised -- are receiving a tiny amount of the spend.    \nb. The vast majority of spending goes into the pockets of pensioners.\n\nOne of the things that always grates on me when government spending comes up is that there's always someone chirping in that if you don't pay over \u00a310,000 in tax and NICs you're not a net taxpayer anyway.  And yeah, on an aggregated national level, sure.  However, when you want to say to me, \"You're not a net taxpayer, we gave \u00a35,000 to pensioners, the NHS and education on your behalf, so you more than had your money's worth...\"  Well now, pretty obviously I didn't get the pension, half the NHS spend when on the over 65s and, I don't have any kids.  The whole, 'net tax payer' argument makes no sense at all.  Ok, slightly angry detour over...\n\nAnother thing is that I believe that tax credits have done a great deal to destroy incomes.  Here's the thing...  It's self-evident that employers want to pay the lowest wages that still retains staff and productivity.  If you're eligible for tax credits and your income won't rise past the upper limit for tax credits, there's no incentive to seek a higher wage.  That is, if your income goes up by 50p per hour, but your tax credits drop by the same, you're no better off.  If you're no better off, who cares?\n\nGetting a fifth of households onto tax credits puts a huge number of people in a position where minimum wage as maximum wage is acceptable to them.  In the end it becomes circular.  Bad wages are ok, because it's topped up.  Top ups are needed, because wages are poor.",

It seems like payment on completion causes a lot of problems since it means there's a big lag between the suppliers providing goods and the cash flowing back up the supply chain from the final customer. Is that just 'how things are done' or are you dealing with large organisations that can throw their weight around when it comes to credit terms? (I know Tesco's has a bad rep for slow payment).\n\n>Thirdly, we've negotiated a fixed price for a quantity of parts from the supplier, this includes the materials and labour. \n\nIs there any reason why your supplier contract couldn't include a surcharge for short notice work? Could that work in the context of your industry? I suppose in a sense this just passes the buck to you to retain cash reserves, but ideally you would in turn surcharge your customers on the same basis. Of course, bargaining power matters, and I suppose whichever part of the supply chain has least clout has to eat it on this kind of stuff and just take the hit on overtime. \n\nI guess it's easy to talk at cross terms. With regard to your previous post about the supplier being unable to get overtime if he's already maxed out on wages, I would say his real maximum is whatever he can pay and still be able keep your business by delivering rushed orders as required. So in that sense his maximum wage already takes account of leaving that bit of breathing space for overtime. ",

Finally, if they have such limited cash flow that they are one week's pay away from going out of business, then we wouldn't want to do business with them at all, because of the supply risk, they could go under for any reason and we wouldn't get any of our parts.\n\nA local authority has a contract out for tender for 40,000 units, we compete with similar firms supplying a relatively similar product (but ours is better than the rest, naturally) they're all at a similar price point, but we managed to knock \u00a31 of the unit price because we negotiated with our suppliers slightly better*. Although we make a small profit margin, we can't go any lower because of the liquidity risk. So we win the contract, it will take about six months, to build and the customer takes weekly deliveries.
