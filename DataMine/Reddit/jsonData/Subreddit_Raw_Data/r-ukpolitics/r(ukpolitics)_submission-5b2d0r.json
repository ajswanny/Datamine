    "body": "American here (shoot me now, but also educate me)\n\nFrom a constitutional perspective, the way the U.K. government is set up, the average person has much less political power than the person in America or Germany. The power in the UK is much more centralized - your prime minister yields much more political power than the America's president, and they aren't even voted on directly by the people, like in the US, but appointed by parliament, correct? \n\nSecondly, the cabinet of the prime minister consists only of the prime minister's party, centralizing the opinion and power of government, correct? In the US, there has been a history of cabinet appointments [across party lines](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_political_appointments_across_party_lines) in our executive branch. Does this hold true for Britain? \n\nAdditionally, while both houses in the US legislature yield significant political power, only the House of Commons holds significant legislative power - doesn't the House of Lords consist of hereditary inheritance or appointments, rather than being elected? From what I gather, the House of Lords can delay or propose bill amendments, but they can't actually prevent a bill from passing, e.g. they can't vote a bill down - little political power relatively, but still some say. \n\nFurthermore, the UK constitution is not really an enumerated, single document like the U.S. Constitution, but rather a sum of all English Law, making the UK's process of judicial review much more weak than America's.\n\nMy point is, the U.K. Government is one of _less_ individual voter choice than the US. Federally, you can't vote directly for a Prime Minister, you can't vote directly for an entire chamber of the legislature, \nyour government can't exercise the process of judicial review as strongly as in the United States. . .I'm asking where you think choice is in the matter for the people that isn't already marginalized and centralized within the government, who has great authority to unilaterally decide things for itself without direct voter input?\n\nWhy is it wrong for people to want more of a say in government, as many of you seem to be suggesting?  Given power in the U.K. is centralized relative to other western countries, do people not have a right to demand a the government do what they want at times when it doesn't do what the people want, but instead, refers to a law that isn't listed explicitly in an enumerated constitution, as justification for spurning the people? It's a treaty provision of the EU, not part a U.K. constitution in the same way it is of the American Constitution.\n\nAs an American, I can see why these Brexit people are mad - they wanted change, a treaty law is preventing it, of which they have no direct vote to influence the government about it.

I listened to the 5-Live phone in this morning and there was a guy there literally in tears because he thought the \"Leave he voted for\" was being subverted.\n\nA few people tried gamely to explain that this doesn't change the result of the referendum and that we are still 99.9% likely to be submitting Article 50... but it was no use.\n\nThis whole thing is *very simple to explain*. It's not even a complicated or controversial issue. We can't submit Article 50 without a vote in the house due to long standing *British Law*. That vote will only depend on some additional detail around the governments intent for the future negotiations. It will pass in a landslide assuming May doesn't put \"Whatever I fucking feel like, losers\" in the proposal.\n\nThe goddamn media is **again** responsible for fanning the flames of fear and anger and they are using artificial ignorance to keep people in that state of uncertainty. That is much more useful to them than taking 10 lines of text to explain that this just a procedural matter - and that we will still be exiting the EU. Even the BBC are reluctant to air any reassurance at this point. Meanwhile, the rhetoric has escalated in hostility to the point where real, actual violence is all but guaranteed. ",

That's why it was never looked into properly. \n\nI personally voted remain for personal reasons. But even I could see before the election it was a serious matter to discuss and take seriously. I could see around me a gaining majority wanting to leave. Yet Cameron still harped on rubbish even I couldn't believe. Democracy spoke.

So, some of those horrible laws from the EU won't apply any more. Which laws specifically? Nobody knows.\n* We can sign our own trade deals! We'll lose existing trade deals with about 100 countries, and each trade deal takes anything from 2-10 years, and we have no experienced trade negotiators, but eventually we might have one or more new trade deals with countries the EU doesn't have trade deals with.\n* \"Sovereignty\", whatever that means. Nobody seems to know, but everyone seems very confident we'll have more of it.\n* And finally, the Turkish won't be able to move here, we won't have to join the Euro, we won't have to join a United States of Europe, and we won't have to contribute to the EU army. But, respectively ... that wasn't realistic in the next few decades, Cameron had secured several protections against that eventuality, joining couldn't happen without direct consent anyway, and we could (and would) have blocked the creation of an EU army anyway.",

This is due to an old, but still necessary law passed in The 1600s which effectively reduced the power of the crown. The government are executors of the crown, so therefor they do not have this power, although they thought they did. This is important because the referendum was not legally binding, i.e. Just because we as a country voted a majority leave, May does not have the legal basis or powers to invoke article 50 without parliamentary consent. If the referendum had been voted as being legally binding by parliament in the first place she probably could have. \nAll in all it is a good thing, there is no precedent for an event of this scale in modern politics, and this ruling states that the prime minister/ current government do not have the power alone to make such massive decisions without the consent of parliament first. \nIt's a bit more complicated but ELI5 and all.... hope this helps",

So the judges ruled the referendum result can be ignored by the Commons (lower house), as only MPs can invoke Article 50 (Leaving EU).

This is due to FPTP voting in MPs, the is Commons heavily pro-EU, so they'd have to vote against their own wishes, or unleash the wrath of the nation.  What you'll probably get is pro-EU MPs including endless amendments, blocking at every turn.  This is what the people who brought the court case want, hoping that buying time will possibly enable the UK to stay in the EU.  \n\nWe also have the Lords (upper house), who nobodies voted for, who could also block it.

The unelected Lords blocking it would really piss people off.\n\nEssentially the judges ruling has laid bare democratic deficits in the UK.

If we wanted to just follow the exact will of the people, we would just have votes (referendums) on everything. Or we would do something like [sortition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sortition). \n\nThe whole point of having MPs is exactly FOR things like \"should we leave the EU or not\" - things that really, the public knows literally almost nothing about, and MPs are likely to know a lot more about. \n\nThis isn't to say anything about the current situation. IMO, we should never have had a referendum. But now that we are in this situation, it's kind of fucked up. It's very possible people will *feel* democracy is being \"subverted\" by going against the will of the people, so that might make it unviable.

The Government is made up from the majority party/coalition in the Commons, or failing that, simply the largest (minority government).

Generally there are about 32ish Ministers, and they each have on average 2-3 junior ministers, with large departments like the Treasury and Foreign Office having a couple more. So in fact the Government is about 50-100 MPs from the largest grouping that sit in Cabinet (or answer to a Cabinet Minister), and the MPs without a ministry are known as the Party Backbenchers or the Government backbenchers. New laws, and many executive actiony bits, need to be passed by a vote in Parliament.\n\nCabinet/Junior Ministers can also come from the Lords, incidentally, but no majority is required there as it isn't an elected chamber.\n\nThe government has most of the propositional opportunities in terms of legislation, but you still get motions proposed by people outside the government too. Meanwhile the government has access to a whole range of powers that once belonged to The Crown that allows them to not use Parliament, and tools such as the Privy Council. This gets complicated, so wiki that shit. The government was hoping to basically use a lot of sovereign sort of powers to drive through Brexit, but the courts just said \"that don't apply to this shit fam, go to Parliament\".

There really is no chance of Brexit not happening... eventually. It's just a question of when and how. May is concerned that parliament will want to scrutinise her plans, which is bad in and of itself because they're probably not very good and won't please anyone but also because it might delay invoking Article 50, which will annoy the more zealous Brexiteers, who want out ASAP no matter the consequences and seethe at the slightest suspicion that their glorious victory might be taken from them.  \nThere is a real possibility of a Brexit Bill being rejected by the commons or the lords because of it being shoddily prepared and vague. That would just mean the government would have to draft a new bill and go through the process again, which would delay Brexit by many months.  \nThat would annoy all involved (including the EU) as nobody wants the period of uncertainty to drag out.

Now it seems we prefer to kneejerk and feel the need to get pushy.\n\nThe British way to deal with adversity is to tut in annoyance and set about making it a non-issue. It is highly unbecoming to make so much noise about 'freedom'. When freedom is truly at stake, we quietly and politely dispatch the threat by putting aside our disdain for everyone around us and working together without actually making it clear we're doing so.",

Immigrants aren't being kicked out, so there's no real change to the existing job or housing markets on that front. Future housing depends on building, which we're not doing nearly enough of, and curbing of foreign investment, which isn't EU-related. We need more immigrants to build enough houses, and we're not going to be able to attract them as easily now. \n\nAnd as for jobs - right now we have record unemployment, and the experts agree that leaving the EU will almost certainly result in large job losses. So, no, it doesn't mean more jobs for British people either.\n\n> they will be able to decide their own regulations and not have the EU give them regulations.\n\nAlmost certainly not. If we do leave, we'll be hoping to get a deal that includes minimal non-tariff barriers. That means regulatory harmony - the same regulations applying here as in the EU. The upshot of that is that we'll almost certainly have to obey at least some EU regulations, but won't have a say in what they are.\n\nAnd which of those EU regulations specifically is it that's worth doing ourselves so much damage over?

When we leave, we are no longer party to those deals.\n\nWe might well go to each country and ask for the same deal, but there's less in it for them - the UK is a smaller market (and now one with significantly less buying power than it had in June) than the EU. A country might be willing to allow EU financial services to sell inside their borders, in return for being able to sell to 300 million people. They might be much less interested in doing so for 70 million. \n\nThat's not to say it won't happen. But I would have thought it would be the exception, rather than the rule, that countries would just agree to the same deal with the UK as with the EU.\n\nAnd don't forget, it was a key message of the Leave campaign that the EU doesn't do great trade deals. Why would we want to keep the same ones if the majority have voted and said we can make better ones by ourselves?",

This requires 1-2 h of \"work\" once every 4 years.\n\nAnd barring huge legal frameworks like CETA, most bills are relatively short, with multiple pages dedicated to definitions and lots of white space.
