    "body": "I read an analysis of terrorism several years ago that I thought was really helpful, but I forget the context and have no hope of finding the original article.  The basic gist of it was this:\n\nEffective terrorism cannot significantly damage the civilization that it targets.  Generally speaking, terrorism is perpetrated by those who would wage war more directly, since it has a greater ability to inflict damage, but they lack the organization and weaponry to do so.  Terrorism might kill some people and cause some damage, sure, but it has no hope of defeating the enemy.\n\nBut with smart terrorists, their aim isn't to cause significant damage to their enemy.  The goal is to instill panic in their enemy, which will cause the enemy to overreact and damage itself.  What they're trying to cause is almost like an allergic reaction, where a bee sting might cause a person's immune system to overreact, and the systems designed to protect the body are turned on themselves, causing far more damage than the bee sting itself.\n\nSo you take an organization like ISIS.  They can't do much to harm the US or UK on a systemic level.  The most they can achieve is to kill a handful of people in a random attack.  With a lot of work, planning, and preparation, maybe they can kill a few hundred, or maybe a few thousand.  It's horrific, but it's not really enough to cause serious damage to the US or UK as a whole.\n\nBut that's not the point.  The point is to cause an overreaction.  People think they're thwarting the terrorists by instituting draconian security and preventing their next attack, but they have it backwards.  For a smart terrorist, pushing us toward ever-increasing security crackdowns is the point, and the attacks are just a means to that end.  The increased security has the following effects:\n\n* It's expensive, harming our country's economy and inhibiting our ability to accomplish other things.\n* It causes the government to restrict and harm our own citizens, which in turn causes dissatisfaction, inefficiency, and disfunction within our country.\n* It causes distrust and antagonistic behavior among citizens\n* It causes use to treat immigrants and foreigners as suspicious or evil, which amplifies the \"us vs. them\" mentality, furthering the terrorist agenda and hurting our standing in the world.\n* It causes fatigue in dealing with international problems, increasing the likelihood that our government will eventually retreat from the venue where the terrorists operate.\n\nIIRC, the original article provided other, more detailed explanations and included examples, but I think that was the general idea.  Basically, when confronted with a terrorist attack, our instinct is to lock everything down, which makes some degree of sense.  It makes sense in the same way that it makes sense for a person's throat to swell shut while eating a food they're allergic to.  It helps to prevent entry to a foreign body that may be dangerous.  However, it also cuts off your air supply.",

In addition to the lib dem's stance on snooping and bulk data collection as mentioned in the op, the lib dems are rolling back a range of benefit cuts that labour haven't committed to doing so, as they presumably need the money for free university. Tim farron mentioned on question time last night that the new regime, especially with a planned raise to maintenance grants from our manifesto, has resulted in high application numbers, particularly from disadvantaged students. The IFS also noted that our planned tax regime is in effect, the fairest, hitting  the income of low earners the least, with a more balanced distribution elsewhere.\n\n\nFor me, one of the key success stories of the coalition was the British business bank, and we're looking to expand its role, provide start up funding working with banks, and make large capital investment, including an extensive infrastructure and broadband programme, as well as tqx incentives for tech firms. Ideally this will help spread the benefits of economic growth across the country. We have also committed to maintaining our membership of various European partnerships in both business and science, one of the key ones being euratom. We're also planning on raising the science budget at least in line with inflation and have a goal of doubling research spending. Essentially it boils down to trying to guide and support a modern, forward looking economy with the uk's world class tech sector. \n\n\nOn the note of partnerships, we are also commited to maintaining membership of horizon 2020, and have an air quality commitment in our manifesto. A key concern for me is that environmental issues fall by the wayside, and the libs look to maintain European cooperation, and also combine environmental policy with uk-wide investment - an immediate go ahead on Swansea tidal lagoon, expansion of regional airports and intercity infrastructure rather than further expansion of the London airports, moving north east Scotland away from oil, etc. \n\n\nI am talking for far too long now, so if you have any more questions do ask, or our [online manifesto](http://www.libdems.org.uk/manifesto) has various breakdowns so you can look at sectors that are important to you ",

And the legislature was trying to tax the Penn family lands to pay for frontier defense during the French and Indian War. And the Penn family kept instructing the governor to veto. Franklin felt that this was a great affront to the ability of the legislature to govern. And so he actually meant purchase a little temporary safety very literally. The Penn family was trying to give a lump sum of money in exchange for the General Assembly's acknowledging that it did not have the authority to tax it.\n\nAlthough it's worth clarifying,\n\n> It is a quotation that defends the authority of a legislature to govern in the interests of collective security. It means, in context, not quite the opposite of what it's almost always quoted as saying but much closer to the opposite than to the thing that people think it means.\n\n[Source](http://www.npr.org/2015/03/02/390245038/ben-franklins-famous-liberty-safety-quote-lost-its-context-in-21st-century)\n\nI think Franklin's \"liberty\" maybe a little different in the proper context than the liberty we're suggesting today.

If so, then let him explain to us why we don't strike for example - Sweden? And we know that freedom-haters don't possess defiant spirits like those of the 19 hijackers. No, we fight because we are free men who don't sleep under oppression. We want to restore freedom to our nation, just as you lay waste to our nation. \n\n#\n\n> I say to you, God knows that it had never occurred to us to strike the towers. But after it became unbearable and we witnessed the oppression and tyranny of the American/Israeli coalition against our people in Palestine and Lebanon, it came to my mind.\n\n>...\n\n\n>In those difficult moments many hard-to-describe ideas bubbled in my soul, but in the end they produced an intense feeling of rejection of tyranny, and gave birth to a strong resolve to punish the oppressors.\n",

    "body": "> The words appear originally in a 1755 letter that Franklin is presumed to have written on behalf of the Pennsylvania Assembly to the colonial governor during the French and Indian War. The letter was a salvo in a power struggle between the governor and the Assembly over funding for security on the frontier, one in which the Assembly wished to tax the lands of the Penn family, which ruled Pennsylvania from afar, to raise money for defense against French and Indian attacks. The governor kept vetoing the Assembly\u2019s efforts at the behest of the family, which had appointed him. So to start matters, Franklin was writing not as a subject being asked to cede his liberty to government, but in his capacity as a legislator being asked to renounce his power to tax lands notionally under his jurisdiction. In other words, the \u201cessential liberty\u201d to which Franklin referred was thus not what we would think of today as civil liberties but, rather, the right of self-governance of a legislature in the interests of collective security.\n\n> What's more the \u201cpurchase [of] a little temporary safety\u201d of which Franklin complains was not the ceding of power to a government Leviathan in exchange for some promise of protection from external threat; for in Franklin\u2019s letter, the word \u201cpurchase\u201d does not appear to have been a metaphor. The governor was accusing the Assembly of stalling on appropriating money for frontier defense by insisting on including the Penn lands in its taxes--and thus triggering his intervention. And the Penn family later offered cash to fund defense of the frontier--as long as the Assembly would acknowledge that it lacked the power to tax the family\u2019s lands. Franklin was thus complaining of the choice facing the legislature between being able to make funds available for frontier defense and maintaining its right of self-governance--and he was criticizing the governor for suggesting it should be willing to give up the latter to ensure the former.",

The original meaning, without context, escapes us but instead the quote on it's own takes with it new thinking and meaning.\n\nBetter to do that I think than just slap the original quote on a fancy background in a posh font. :P",

It'll mask your IP address, so the location data will be far coarser (infered from context rather than geolookup), but they will get all the rest of the data on you they would otherwise get.\n\nYou are also making the gamble that the VPN isn't also a bad actor, given that they see exactly as much traffic as your ISP/network administrator (far more than Facebook/Google). That's a lot of trust to put in a company that I know nothing about (take PIA for instance - there is little information about their parent org. available online) - they could, for instance, easily inject malware into returned webpages. At least with your ISP, it's possible to hold them to account for overtly malicious actions, but that is not the case for a company in an overseas jurisdiction whose's owners may be impossible to track down. \n\nA better solution is to insist on end-to-end encryption, then you aren't reliant on the quality of the underlying network (so the VPN question is moot for protecting the _content_ you browse [not sources, domains would still be visible]), and locally blocking known tracking beacons (to limit the information Facebook/Google etc. can acquire). That way, any ISP/government surveillance is (largely) limited to the domains you visit, but none of the content. That would make a VPN _significantly_ less necessary for private Internet usage, and would make the decision to use one much safer (even if the provider is a bad actor, they are limited in what they can see and can't tamper with your traffic if it is end-to-end encrypted).",

The root of this is the self-imposed insulation of the particularly devout community. The only way to tackle that is to erode the influence of the fundamentalist preachers. \n\nI don't buy that overseas military intervention is reasonable cause for home-grown jihadism. I don't believe that the Muslim community has been 'condemned' by the British public to the extent that it would encourage radicalism. I also don't believe it relates to immigration. \n\nI can tell you via the experience of friends of mine that it is difficult to find a mosque in the UK that does not have fundamentalist influences from the Saudi Wahhabi/Salafi schools. I've seen similar reports from cities like Berlin, where Syrian immigrants end up going to Turkish mosques because they are free from this influence. \n\nIslamic fundamentalism drives a huge wedge between the Muslim population of the UK and the rest. The result of that is thousands of Muslims who feel lost and marginalised, have no connection with their nationality, and are desperate for a purpose in life. It is at that point where they become vulnerable to radicalisation. ",

I don't want us to leave NATO, and we won't. As long as we're in NATO, our own leaders views on \"nuclear deterrent\" don't matter. \n2. PR would result in extremists on both sides. I don't want to see an seats given to UKIP or Greens, or nationalist parties. Those parties all weaken our society. PR only works when \"the plebs\" are switched on about politics. As we've seen, the majority of our country is going to vote against their own best interests. (See, JAMs currently going Tory or UKIP). I don't want people to be proportionally represented by stupidity and granting seats to those parties whilst it may be \"democratic\", I care less about \"democracy\" than I do about a strong government. It's all well and good saying everyones opinion is equal but that's fundamentally untrue (See, Brexit). \n\n3. Lib Dems generally support privatisation. Whilst I don't think al energy companies need to be fully nationalised, I believe we should have A publicly owned energy company, and the railways & NHS must remain in public ownership to me. I don't believe free uni education is necessary, people should be expected to invest in their future. I don't believe in free market ideology, the market needs some regulation or intervention lest we turn into America. \n\nThe biggest failing for the LD was to back the Torys in 2010. Under FPTP I can eventually see a Labour/Lib Dem coalition happening which would be A) representative and B) socially & economically secure.",

I think Corbyn genuinely wants the best for Britian, it's just I happen to disagree with many of his stances.\n\n2. I don't see silencing \"extremists\" as a reason for breaking democracy. My vote should be as heard as anyone elses, regardless of where I live. Telling anyone otherwise is patronising and holier-than-thou. I would argue that strength of government is not as important as it's accountability to the people. If you want a \"representative\" (because more often than not, the MPs aren't representative of their own population) state rather than an actual democracy, that's fine, but I'll going to fundamentally disagree with you simply because I believe in democracy and liberal values. Also, speaking of \"stability\" and \"strong government\", consider that the SNP, a party that wants to break away, is overly represented as a result of FPTP, and could lead to the death of the UK as we know it.\n\nPeople genuinely wanted to leave the EU. You may not like it, and you may not see their reasons for it, but their reasons are varied and can *not* be universally attributed to stupidity. Also, we aren't talking about *direct democracy* for every issue, we are talking about a *genuinely representative democracy*. Representatives often, but not always, have more of a clue what they are talking about and voting about that the average Joe who you seem to have a problem with having a vote.\n\nI don't really know enough about economics to have an opinion on privatisation of stuff. My gut says it works better in some cases (like energy) but not in others (like the NHS) but I'd trust economists over me. \n\nI agree, we probably shouldn't have backed the Tories, a coalition with the Brown government would have made for a socially liberal government to govern with, but the past is the past and Mr Farron says we won't form a coalition with the Tories this time.",

It's this \"no deal is better than a bad deal\" mentality that works well in a boardroom but not well on the international stage. The status quo is very much in the EU's favour.\n\nWe simply cannot leave with \"no deal\" due to the fact we'd be turning back on 40 some odd years worth of legislation and trade agreements and so on. I believe it was the Financial Times who said that after Brexit we'd have to renegotiate somewhere around 750 odd trade deals with over 100 countries. An absolutely monumental task.\n\nThis is why the Lib Dems believe a referendum on the terms is fair.
