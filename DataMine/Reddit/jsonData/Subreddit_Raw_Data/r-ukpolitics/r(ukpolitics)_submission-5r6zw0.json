It's not that people are silent about things which are now history, but rather at the time of, say, Obama, there wasn't the same frenzy that we're seeing currently.\n\nIt undermines the ability to effectively attack Trump if every single story about him you see in any paper is negative, as that becomes \"the norm\". Meaning, when he does do something truly awful, it won't have the same impact when it's reported on. This has already worked for him during the campaign, meaning he has been able to say truly awful things but the impact has been tiny (on the population as a whole) because he always sounds so evil in the media constantly anyway. It also plays into the narrative Trump has of being the \"victim\" of an \"evil media\".",

Trump's a nasty racist sure, but he didn't make this law up from scratch - the protests should have come at the first stages of this type of law. \n\nSo yes, protests should be judged on the merits of that particular cause as opposed to what the protesters have previously done or not done, but by selectively protesting and ignoring certain issues, the left opens itself up for criticism and their protests are somewhat diminished in effect.

So when his foreign policy was business as usual (drone striking willy-nilly and throwing out \"collateral damage\" as a excuse) we often criticized it and passed it off as the military complex pushing on rather than a personal action of Obama. While Trump is an unlikable cunt rag, who's personally setting into motion a string of high profile, controversial orders within his first two weeks of power and is riding on a mounting wave of outrage.

People's attention spans are sporadic and unreliable, and there isn't always a one-to-one correlation between the severity of an injustice and its response. It's not hard to find a Tory who gets more worked up about the fox-hunting ban than the recent rise in homelessness, and it's not hard to find a labour supporter who gets more worked up over recycling than mental health provision. Unless we're dealing with the actual holocaust, there's always going to be some injustice you can point to and say \"well what about x?\".\n\nWhich means that proportionality in relation to reactions to previous injustices isn't a very good metric at all for evaluating the validity or appropriateness of a given protest or reaction. Rather, the more obvious metric would be whether the injustice being protested is worthy of opposition in its own right. If you think Trump's muslim ban is worth opposing, you can safely support the opposition without referring to a graph of all your reactions to previous situations. If you don't, you need to think of a proper counter-argument rather than just repeating the same reactionary \"what-about?\" argument.",
