Not to mention our NATO allies would have a thing or two to say about our actions. We would be cut adrift, alone, with a target painted on our backs by far superior militaries in terms of numbers and technology.\n\nThe lack of geopolitical insight by the questioners was really quite disturbing.\n\nI think Corbyn didn't answer this particularly well. However, I would like to see Theresa May subjected to the same scrutiny. \"Prime Minister would you launch a first strike against Iran or North Korea?\" Obviously she would not say yes, if she did it would be mental, and this would hopefully put the issue to bed.",

He's not willing to lie, even if it is in the national interest, and would rather say how he really feels so that everyone knows how moral he is. It's pride and ego.\n\nNo one wants to start/end a nuclear war. But it's important to pretend that you would retaliate, because it decreases the risk of anyone ever starting one. Pretending you might be a potential vengeful sociopathic mass murderer, decreases the risk of nuclear escalation. Without it, small scale tactical use of nukes would have been quite likely. The only thing that is damaged by the lie, is Corbyn's ego.\n\nSame goes for the Falklands. I don't disagree with Corbyn's position on the Falkland's. However, suggesting you might not defend the Falklands increases the risk of an invasion. Better to lie that you might send troops in in the event of an invasion, even if you won't and would prefer a negotiated solution.\n\nInternational politics isn't like national politics. There is no social contract to fall back on, no law of the land, police or democratic mandate.\n\nInternational politics is the continuation of war by other means.",

What credible threats to the UK have the Russians posed in the last 4 decades, where the response could plausibly have been use of our nuclear deterrent?\n\nThe only things the nuclear deterrent deters against are a large-scale land invasion of Europe by the Russians, or a nuclear first strike. Neither of those are terribly likely, for the following reasons:\n\n* It would provoke a (nuclear and/or conventional) response by NATO\n* There is no domestic political advantage to the Russians by doing so\n* There would be significant economic damage to Russian interests\n* It would annoy the Chinese\n\nRussia's interests are more effectively furthered by smaller scale regional meddling which is easier to portray to the domestic audience as a struggle against terrorism and/or western interference in their sphere of influence, and by soft-power intervention/interference in the political discourse of other nations. Neither of these are effectively curtailed by the presence of the nuclear deterrent.\n\nRussia (and China) is no longer a nation entirely closed off to the outside world. It has significant economic and strategic interests in other countries which would be adversely impacted by a large-scale war of aggression. It holds nuclear weapons because having them provides an advantage in deterring other nations from intervening in small-scale regional conflicts it is involved in. However there is no such comparable advantage for the west because we are geographically distant from weak states where these conflicts occur and activating a nuclear first strike policy is politically non-viable.\n\nThat is why, despite our having nuclear weapons, NATO has failed to effectively defend Ukraine and also one of the reasons why Russia has a free hand in Syria.\n\n**Edit:**\n\nThink about it this way: *The Russians have managed to successfully rig the outcome of the US presidential election, despite the US having a massive nuclear arsenal.* **Nuclear weapons are totally ineffective**.",

The superpowers (Russia, America, China) hold arsenals strong enough to deter each of the others.\n\nThe mad cunts (NK, supposedly Iran, and any terror grouphypothetically armed) could only use nukes from an already under-armed position, and would be have to be willing to accept mass destruction of their own territories before they struck.\n\nAnd then theres everyone else. The UK, France, Pakistan etc. Regional powers with interests which out value the potential ideological benefits of a limited exchange. With the exception of Pakistan vs India there is only a limited deterrent factor in keeping these arsenals online, as more conventional political and economic factors provide disincentives which are at least as strong as thst provided by these weapons. \n\nThe Pakistan vs India exception only exists as a consequence of routine border scuffles, which sometimes escalate scarily quick. The presence of roughly equaly arsenals creates a regional MAD which does bring stability.\n\nBut France doesnt need to see trident before it decides not to nuke us. We have no similar enemies, apart from the Mad Cunts I mentioned before and they arent deterred by MAD situations. \n\nNobody who wants to nuke us is deterred by our weapons and the superpowers see us as a possible target in an exchange purely because of our nukes.\n\nTrident does not keep us safe, because its not powerful enough to act as a real deterrent to mad cunts. The superpowers wont attack us with nukes if we dont have any nukes, and our regional nuclear peers are our fucking allies.\n\nIf youre still thinking favourably about this red herring, think about this. If Russia launched a unilateral nuclear strike on this country, we would be completely destroyed. Russia, no matter how many hits we got in on her, would barely be scratched in comparison. Thats the difference in size of our active arsenals. \n\nNow given that fact, would a petty revenge strike to kill a couple of million russians be satisfying let alone effective?\n\nThere is no deterrence. At the moment we just have nuclear peace, but if that ever changed we'd bite it fucking hard.\n\nTrident needs to be scrapped or we need to invest in an arsenal the size of the US, Rus, and China.

Obviously this is a pretty unique case given my degree is Urban Planning, which is a tiny cohort of people compared to most uni degrees and we all got forced to do this Economics module but it did highlight to me how few people have a basic economic understanding.

But by not being able to commit to using it (or even just saying he would) in certain cases, then not necessarily everyone will have lost, just us. The only reason everyone loses in nuclear war is because both sides sustain huge casualties. If one side doesn't at least say that they'll use them then there isn't really a deterrent.\n\nYou mention that the closest the world has come to nuclear war was the cold war. The biggest reason that there wasn't a full scale war between the two countries was MAD. Kennedy/Truman thought that if they used any military force then the soviets would respond with an overwhelming nuclear assault, and the soviets thought the US would do the same if they acted first.\nIf JFK or Truman had not been able to say that he would respond to a nuclear assault with nuclear weapons then the soviets would have had a huge leverage as they would have felt at less risk.",

Although if Trump was still in power I could see him leaving Europe to defend itself but it's unlikely he will be in power, but you never know in this crazy world. France have nukes so they would possibly nuke Russia to defend against an invasion and then it has escalated anyway and the world as we know it is over. \n\nAlso, we would not know if a hostile nation is about to launch a nuke so the 'hit them before they hit us' thing is nonsense. We cant even suss out that some twisted bastard on our own soil is about to walk into a concert and blow himself up. Despite being warned that he's twisted, so figuring out where on their own soil they have nuclear missile silos is likely beyond us. (That aside it would be interesting to know how advanced our satellite surveillance is).\nTo know about an imminent first strike would require having someone undercover at the highest level. Maybe we do in some countries but I very much doubt it. We would also have to know where their nuclear subs are and secondly be able to tell if those subs are about to launch a nuke. Again, highly unlikely but interested to hear solid evidence to the contrary.\n\nWhat about second strike? Retaliation with nuclear bombs is simply a bloodlust revenge that some people may want to do. \n\nI'm not sure if we have tactical nuclear capability, we probably do, that does raise more questions because like someone else said localised nuclear blasts give a huge battlefield advantage and could destroy an invasion force. I don't know anything about the range and launch requirements, vehicles, ships? I don't know. Would be interesting to find out.\n\nTl;dr Corbyn saying he wouldn't make a first strike doesn't mean our nuclear deterrent is null and void. The situation would be way way waaaay more complicated than the tubby simpleton on TV was making out it out to be.\n",

    "body": "As I understood it and after skim reading https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_winter now: not quite.  \nThere are differing opinions (it's complicated). Most models predict a nuclear winter (some catastrophic) but probably valid criticisms abound about these models (their assumptions and methods) but not to the point of producing better ones that categorically show no winter.  \nThe wiki page is long and certainly doesn't conclude that the idea is a myth or read as the idea is a historical one.   \nApparently  \n\n> William R. Cotton, Professor of Atmospheric Science at Colorado State University,...[said] in 2007... \"We must wait for a new generation of GCMs [Global Climate Models] to be implemented to examine potential consequences quantitatively\" and ...that in his experience \"nuclear winter was largely politically motivated from the beginning\"  \n\nI think it's important to note 'largely' is not completely and if it happens to be true it doesn't matter what the motivation for suspecting it is but it should make us a little more sceptical about whether it is true.  \nBut in my opinion, the idea that we need further evidence that nuclear war should be avoided at all costs beyond the megadeath and megainjury then means there's something deeply wrong with us.  \nI suppose the fear is that there are psychopaths in government that might actually consider initiating it under the assumption that they could stay safe in a bunker for a few weeks and then emerge to rule a new world. I wouldn't put that past some people. If that's the case (or even just to mitigate the possibility) then I think this would be one good myth for the world to believe in.",

Not only that, France and Britain and Poland would reject Germany embarking on a Nuclear Weapons Programme.\n\nJapan have fell under the TMCS since 1950 when the allied occupation ended, whereby they agree to maintain only a defence sized military in exchange for guaranteed US defence if attacked.

I'm not questioning your ideology here, just your logic. \n\nWe'll use Putin as an example. Putin (or any other despotic leader) wants power or economic wealth or to exert some form of political ideology on their opponent. If Putin launched a nuclear strike on NATO, he would not have a country left to govern, to extract wealth from, or to exert his political ideology on, there will be nothing left.

Additionally with nuclear weapons you can perform this kind of erasure with strategic resources and natural features, you can take out electronic and space infrastructure with the EMP etc. etc.",

However, the closest the planet ever came to nuclear war was the Cuban Missile Crisis (which, again, nobody predicted.)  *No-one* wanted a nuclear confrontation to break out, but things were very close to spiralling out of control. tension + escalation = danger.  I would argue the only reason a war between Russia and the US didn't break out is because of the Mutually Assured Destruction dynamic that had appeared.\n\n>And the UK is also not a superpower.
