And you do realise that it's completely asinine to play the \"commie\" card when you're trying to convince an age group that were mostly born AFTER the soviet union fell.. The commie card isn't going to work because to them it's just empty words with no substance. It's the same reason why the IRA card didn't work either. If it seems straw-clutching and not even in living memory then it loses all its impact.\n\nThe young want change, not a continuation of a system that they widely regard as failed. They will vote for anyone who promises a radically different system. Corbyn promises a wildly different system, while the Tories simply parrot Clinton's mantra of \"the UK is already a great place and doesn't need any change\" which unsurprisingly didn't resonate at all.

Now Corbyn is an old fashioned Socialist, and last time his sort were in charge of it, the Labour party was absolutely against British membership of what was then the Common Market for exactly this reason, that competition in the free market undermines the old Labour model of secure well paid union jobs in protected nationalised industries.

If someone defaults on personal loans or credit cards, there is no way to recoup that money. So obviously unsecured loans are going to have higher interest rate. \n\nAlso the likelihood of default is higher for people who take on personal loans vs those who don't. So obviously that also plays a role.",

Say you're \u00a325 over your limit without permission; Lloyds charge _ten pounds a day_. That's not interest, you'll note; that's a fee for their service in providing this loan. Interest is _extra_.\n\nSuddenly Wonga and chums don't look quite so evil, don't you think?\n\nThose of us who have gilt-edged credit ratings can easily deal with such a situation. Ring up and ask for an overdraft extension, you'll get it. Or carry a balance on your credit card for a few weeks - you're getting offered 0% for a year cards every other week, after all. It's easy. But if you're a bad rating then one way or another lenders have to cover the default risk, and that either means high interest rates or vicious fees or both. If lenders aren't allowed to do that then you'll have to do without. Except you won't do without, because you can't do without. You'll go to Big Dave down at the Dog and Shark, who charges an arm and a leg in the event of default and we're not quite sure that's even a metaphor.",

Computers that replaced a lot of manual labour in factories has led to the growth of software development jobs and IT jobs, for example.\n\nSure, eventually the net total number of jobs will decrease, but the notion that automation will remove jobs at a huge rate and nothing will replace them isn't factual and hasn't panned out over the centuries that automation has occured.",
