However, the rivals caught up quickly and in terms of quality, it didn't even have a chance against the French. Over time, it stagnated in terms of comfort, technology and safety, whereas the competition, both domestic and foreign, moved on and got better and better. By 1989, when Ford released the groundbreaking new Fiesta, it was hopelessly obsolete, yet they continued to build this unsafe, unreliable and more and more undesirable little car until 1998, by which point it had completely transitioned from national pride to national embarrassment.",

As the Japanese showed it was very possible to make reliable cars with the technology of the time, it was just not as financially lucrative for the domestic manufacturers to do so.\n\nDomestic manufacturers at the time were happy to let a car leave the factory with a relatively high defect rate compared to the Asian counterparts.  I did a study on this years ago for a college paper and while I forget the exact numbers it was something like a domestic car would leave the factory with an average of 10 deficits vs an Asian one with only 2.\n\nSo right off the bat a domestic car was not going to be as reliable but that was ok to the manufacturers because spending less money on quality control == moar profits.  And then it was a double whammy since then you had to bring your car in to be fixed with parts from...those manufacturers!  To them it was a win win, until there was a double whammy to them of the gas crisis and Asian manufacturers showed the market that you could in fact have a reliable car.\n\nThe domestic market did eventually get a clue and started making cars that were much more in line with the Asian market defect rate but to this day they still are typically not as reliable.",

I will never forget Scottish independence being explained in the value of bags of chips a week Scots will have if they remain [one, one bag of chips, my kingdom for the weekly chippy]. I'd have voted yes to independence on principle, and imo it seems that the Scots went for the original 'project fear' whereas when it was tried during the Brexit debate, it floundered.\n\nI'm not invested in the ideology of Brexit either way [apparently the last person in the country], I just found it deeply frustrating to what degree neither side was prepared to actually give a proper argument. Watching footage from the first Common Market referendum and seeing hour-long debates with positions established and points, arguments, ideology, and counter-points put out by leading figures... honestly it's deeply embarrassing that in this supposed enlightened digital age they talk to us like a bunch of mugs, whereas two generations ago at this point they trusted people to sit and follow a debate between Castle and Heath, or Benn and Jenkins, all actually arguing the toss. I have a lot of faith in people's ability to follow actual arguments, and zero faith in politicians to do anything as vulgar as present an argument that is honest and meaningful, but that could be described as 'ideological'.\n\nanyway tl;dr I agree and I hate them muggy westminster chaps",

Just because we agreed to things, doesn't mean it was forced on us or that we couldn't back out.\n\nMost things can't be vetoed in the EU, and you only get one chance to veto, no do overs. Since the previous British governments didn't veto, against the will of the people, we had no power to undo it. For example the EU does not allow member states to be kicked out. Once you vote to let them in, they can stay as long as they like. Every time a new EU member was added, British power was proportionately greatly reduced. The people would have vetoed if we had referendums, but parliament voted unanimously to accept Croatia in the last enlargement. It's extremely undemocratic. We had almost no power in the EU.\n\nThen there's the fact that the EU allows each member state its own foreign policy and immigration policy. So when the defense minister of Greece in 2015 said he'd flood Europe with migrants from the middle east including ISIS members, there was nothing we could do to stop it except leave the EU. The fact the media barely reported this rigged the referendum in favour of remain and we were lucky leave managed to win narrowly. ",

This is of course assuming that the company in question exports enough to us to care one way or the other. Admittedly companies of German origin might feel inclined, as according to [this](http://www.worldstopexports.com/united-kingdoms-top-import-partners/) Germany exports just over 40 billion dollars worth of stuff to the UK. Other countries, like Sweden, might be less inclined to bother given their exports to us are about 6 billion dollars. I imagine this will come down to the political attitude taken in the aftermath of Brexit among European politicians (and spoiler alert: if Davis, Mogg, Gove, Johnson et al continue to hog the limelight then by the time we're out of the EU then everyone from Angela Merkel to Pepe LePew is going to hate our guts) and on the abilities of each company doing the exporting.  \n  \nThen again, maybe someone will wave a magic wand and at the last minute someone will throw their hands up, say \"oh for fuck sake\" and just slap down an EEA agreement onto the table and say \"sign this and fuck off\" and while we're discussing such possibilities, I might end up shitting glitter.",

I'm just applying that logic to the context of Brexit. Truth be told if I -am- wrong then that's great because it might mean some half-decent news economically for us.
