So, for example, the UK was a country in which 'possession of any amount of a controlled drug is treated as a criminal offence'.\n\nWhile true on paper, this statement does not describe the actual state of UK drug laws with respect to how they are actually enforced. The police have effectively replaced the legal penalties for cannabis with their own invention of a 'cannabis warning', and in recent years even the number of cannabis arrests has begun to fall dramatically.\n\nThe claim in the report which people tend to cite:\n\n >Looking across different countries, there is no apparent correlation between the \u2018toughness\u2019 of a country\u2019s approach and the prevalence of adult drug use.\n\nis therefore deeply misleading.

Aren't there plenty of people in privileged, contented lives who get caught up in drugs? How is this explained? How Plenty of 'facts' in this presentation are really opinions or hypotheses not sufficiently justified. If this were presented as an opinion piece it wouldn't matter so much, but to set the tone that this is some kind of objective explanation of scientific fact (as other videos on the channel) is misleading.\n\nThe video then moves from the psychology of addiction rapidly to drug policy. There is the simple point, always neglected, that the best protection against drug addiction is to make sure it doesn't begin in the first place. The way existing addicts are treated is only one outcome that must be considered in conjunction with outcomes for potential addicts. If the result of a soft approach to drugs is that more people are undeterred from using them and, as a result, take up destructive drug habits, then it's easy to see how a kind and understanding policy on the surface can do more harm than good. Yet the video simply takes it as given that the existing addicts are the only ones whose wellbeing needs to be taken into account.\n\nThis is without getting into the always-overlooked problem that the 'war on drugs' is something of a myth, and that 'prohibition' is rarely enforced on the ground in the places where it allegedly operates. Where it is enforced in free societies under the rule of law, e.g. cannabis in [Japan (0.3%) and Korea (0.1%)](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annual_cannabis_use_by_country), the prevalence of use is much lower. I'm not aware that either of them is any more a 'rat park' than the developed Western countries such as ours which practice *de facto* decriminalisation of cannabis. This would suggest that there are other approaches with better outcomes than our's besides the one we're steered towards by Kurzgezagt.",

Apologies if this is not the case, but that's how it comes across.\n\n\nI've known / know many 'druggies' who are perfectly-functioning members of society that happen to enjoy using cocaine, MDMA, LSD, ketamine, amphetamine, cannabis, meow, mushrooms etc at the weekend. I've known heroin addicts who worked by day and sat there in a haze after work (incredibly sad and realistically not an accurate portrayal of most heroin addicts). The point I'm trying to make is that calling people who use drugs 'druggies' is divisive and dehumanising; and that not all 'druggies' are created equal. \n\n\nShould we call someone a 'boozie' for enjoying a few pints at the weekend?\n\n\nThe whole point of decriminilisation is that it *offers routes to treatment* rather than *routes to criminilisation*. Portugal has gone this route, and unsurprisingly when you offer addicts of hard drugs treatment rather than immersing them in criminality via a stint at HMP, many of them go back to being functional members of society.\n\n\nIt's also important imo not to oversell this. Iirc Portugal has seen hard drug use drop by around 50%, but not everyone gets better. Some people don't want to get better and can't be helped. I'm also not advocating a free pass for crime... violent crime, burglarly etc should be punished. I think it's ludicrous though that in this day and age, with so much data out there on the reality, that we're locked into this \"herp-derp, tough on crime tough on causes of crime tough on drugs\" rhetoric. It's like a political arms race; the war on drugs is an abject failure and can never be won. We need a different approach.\n\n\nOr I guess we could just keep banging our head against the bloody head-print on the wall.",

The problem is the substances they're bulked up with range from baking ingredients right through to fucking rat poison. \n\nSecondly, users aren't educated on the substances beyond being told no. Which results in misuse and abuse which runs a dangerously high risk of things like water toxicity which are fatal. \n\nIn the case of harder drugs like Heroin, purity is an even bigger fucking problem.

You might be enjoying being off the booze but then you sit down to watch a football game and it reminds you that you always used to drink when you watched football so you start craving one etc. This happens with all habits - it's one of the reasons people struggle on diets. My brother is currently struggling with Dry September. He doesn't drink that much and is far from being an alcoholic, but just having to change habits can be very difficult in and of itself.",

Violent crime in Denver went down by 2.2% in the first 11 months of 2014, compared with the first 11 months of 2013. In the same period, burglaries in Denver decreased by 9.5% and overall property crime decreased by 8.9%.\n\nNow I admit these sentences don't explicitly make mention of the fact they are using per capita figures, but the same percentages are seen again later.\n\n> Denver saw a 2.2 percent drop in violent crime **rates** in the year after the first legal recreational cannabis sales in Colorado. Overall property crime dropped by 8.9 percent in the same period there, according to figures from the Drug Policy Alliance.\n\n\n> After recreational use became legal in Colorado, MSNBC reported on crime statistics out of Denver, specifically for the first quarter of 2014. **Rates** of violent crime were 6.9% lower than the first quarter of the previous year; **rates** of property crimes dropped 11.1%\n\nNote the use of the word 'rates'.

They had a serious problem with Methamphetamines after the Second World War before a stricter law enforcement was introduced in 1951 (Stimulant Control Law). Arrests for Methamphetamine subsequently fell from 55,664 in 1954 to 271 in 1958.

Perhaps economic recovery also played a part.\n\nAnd if, by the way, you want to demand complete rigour in extracting the effect of drug laws alone, then your point about 'zealous prohibition policies' doesn't really stand either.",

Naruse says the country\u2019s famous catch phrase, \u201cDame. Zettai.\u201d (similar to the \u201cJust Say No\u201d campaign in the U.S. in the 1980s) simply doesn\u2019t work anymore.\n\nYou seem to have the mindset of the Japanese police on this issue. You don't really care about the harm caused by drug misuse - you simply don't want people doing something you personally disapprove of. \n\nYou claim that you don't want decriminalisation because you are worried about the public ills caused by drug use. Yet here you say:\n\n> No suggestion that system for non-addict criminals should be reformed - because it's effective in keeping drug use down in general.\n\nBut it is a system that is massively harmful to addicts and society - which is why it's being changed. Non-addict \"criminals\" are not really an issue and all harm caused by the drug industry/non-addicts would largely be removed by regulation/legalisation. Funding of criminals, dangers from drugs being cut with various other substances. Addiction and criminalisation is the cause of everything you say you have an issue with regarding drug misuse. All the problems of families being ruined, the damage to society generally etc. that you claim you care about and yet you are willing to sacrifice addicts on the altar of keeping 20-somethings from smoking cannabis by having strict and harsh laws.\n",

So they don't become slaves to their habit, even if it sometimes does define their lifestyle. i.e it's not that difficult for a drug dealer to manipulate and exploit drug addicts because they are desperate for the product and often incapable of sustaining jobs, relationships, life etc and the drug dealers themselves are not typically in the position to manufacture their own product, so an unavoidable hierarchy is created with nearly all the money funneling upwards.",

My concern is for the people who will be more relaxed about *becoming* drug users because they no longer fear the legal consequences, and are naive about the personal consequences.\n\n\nAnd this is the crux of the issue. You can't treat addicts whilst maintaining the deterrent. Because addicts and non-addicts have committed exactly the same crime. \n\nYou throw a once a week cannabis smoking student in prison for years - and he comes out a hardened criminal whom will likely re-offend. Bright, young, ambitious people will still take drugs even when the punishment is harsh (as we saw in the UK back in the 50s/60s and indeed, as we see in Japan - despite the yes, far lower rates) and we will throw their lives away in the hope of deterring others and - similar to the idea that the death penalty is a deterrent - it won't.\n\nYou throw a long-term hard drug addict in prison for years and he comes out with a huge chance of recidivism, no community links, ostracised by society. \n\nBeing a responsible drug user is not a problem for an adult in the same way being a responsible drinker is not a problem for an adult. The problem is addiction - and like we see with alcohol - addiction is multi-faceted. Drinking a couple of beers once or twice a week will not cause addiction in the same way smoking one or two joints a couple of times a week will not cause addiction. Addiction can be treated - but not - as we've seen in Japan, America, the UK, and many other countries - when addiction is a crime.\n\nIf drug use is a crime so is drug addiction. It can be no other way. And it is not only addicts who will suffer from that choice.\n\nI'd like to remind you once again of that article you linked me.\n\n> \u201cNot everyone becomes an addict,\u201d Naruse says. \u201cIt is the lonely, people with low self-esteem and have a strong sense of anxiety about being disliked by others who typically become addicted. Publicly attacking people such as Aska is not going to help at all. \u2026 These types of people have already lost so much along the way.\u201d\n\n",

Certainly on the right, deterrence efficacy is treated as virtually self-evident. The logic is appealing but studies on deterrence of capital punishment generally show the opposite association.\n\nBut I'm also skeptical of the idea that drug use (particularly hard drug use) is identical in effect to other types of crime wrt deterrence. For example, deciding whether to rob someone may largely be a cost/benefit risk assessment. In that case, perhaps deterrence is effective. But drug abuse is at its core an act of self harm. To assert that you can protect someone from self-harm by making their act *even more* self harming would seem nonsense to me, yet that's the underlying logic of criminalising drug users. \n\nNow, if you want to maintain that deterrence does work, you have to argue that the users are rational to some degree (at least they must respond to deterrence). But then you're in a catch-22 because if they don't self harm, then if they choose to do drugs, drugs must make them better off. So why do we need to criminalize it? \n\nAnd that's before we get to the question of whether imprisonment is likely to lead to a better adjusted or worse adjusted person, and what that means for their chances of relapse to drug use and violent crime. \n\nI'd argue things like drink driving have come down because of greater awareness of non-judicial consequences and development of social norms. Most drive aware ads don't feature explanations of the sentence you will face, they show an 8 year old getting killed by a drunk driver. I still think drink-driving prosecution is worthwhile by the way, but that's because the victims of such behavior are so often someone other than the perpetrator. ",
