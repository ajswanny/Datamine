Let's see if anything she announced would help those 'Just About Managing' shall we?  \n  \nThink it's safe to conclude what she announced did absolutely JACK SHIT to help those just about managing. The only thing I can say she stands for at this point, is that JAM means JAM... Not marmalade.",

    "body": "> Theresa May\u2019s first speech on the steps of No 10 a year ago, in which she pledged to tackle the \u201cburning injustices\u201d of modern Britain, put a bold and unexpected emphasis on social wellbeing in the first moments of her government.\n\n> The newly minted prime minister identified the neglected \u201cJams\u201d (just about managing) families, \u201cordinary working class\u201d households who were doing their best but struggled with job insecurity, mortgage repayments, and the ever-rising cost of living.\n\n> \u201cThe government I lead,\u201d May promised the Jam families, \u201cwill be driven not by the interests of the privileged few, but by yours\u201d.\n\n> [...]For their part, the Jams might be forgiven for believing that May has objectively failed to deliver much at all to them over the past 12 months. For many, the household economic outlook remains grindingly flat: static or falling wages, painful gas and electricity bills (though May has promised to reform the energy market), eye-watering rents (for many younger Jams home owning is a distant pipe dream) and rising food prices fuelled by post-Brexit inflation.\n\nThe article goes on to list more broken May promises.",

Out of the \u00a312 Billion worth of social security cuts they are keeping in place the vast majority of them and are dedicated to keeping the benefits cap in place.\n\n[The only people who are better off under Labour's plans are the upper-middle class](https://i.imgur.com/LM9uf6Z.png)\n\n>While the level of the government\u2019s \u201cnational minimum wage\u201d has risen from \u00a37.20 to \u00a37.50, this gain has been offset by the freeze in tax credits and reduced housing benefits\n\nThe minimum wage is rising even more soon and will rise to around \u00a39 by 2020 for those 21 and over. Compare this to Corbyn's policy of an equalised \u00a310 minimum wage for those of all ages which will decimate youth employment, why would anyone want to pay the same wage for a child as for an experienced adult and how will the young gain experience in work?",

Under the current rules - introduced by the Labour Party, a person needing care has to give up their home while still alive and the state will take all of its value except \u00a310k. It may also mean the partner of the person needing it becomes homeless. \n\nUnder what was proposed, the house would not be needed until after death, it couldn't be taken if a surviving partner was still living in it and the state would have to leave the estate \u00a3100k - ten times more than the current rules. \n\nNow, look at in work benefits. These are one of the most stupid things ever introduced by any government on the planet. All it has meant is companies have cut pay, made jobs that were never minimum wage, minimum wage. The tax payer is now subsiding companies and their shareholders. We are subsiding McDonald's. \n\nNext, housing. Housing is not unaffordable. It is unaffordable in the south east and always has been. It was expensive in the 1800's. But, people want to live there and then complain it is expensive. Most of the rest of the U.K. outside the south east isn't. There isn't a job in the SE that can't be found in other places. But people are morons. For example, I live in a picture postcard village, my rent is \u00a3400 a month for a stunning cottage. I am 18 miles from Glasgow where I work. In the SE I would earn maybe an extra \u00a35k a year, but pay about \u00a33k a month in rent. ",

I certainly have personal evidence of that but I'd be interested in research.\n\nCould you also source the graph you've linked? I see the IFS logo but I'd be interested in more context. It seems like your claim that only the upper middle class would benefit under Labour is a little off. The graph seems to show that the net decrease in income for the lower deciles is smaller for the Labour manifesto than for the Conservative manifesto. I appreciate this indicates there will still be a net loss of income in absolute terms, but comparatively the Labour manifesto has better projections for the poorest group than the Conservative manifesto (and the LibDem manifesto appears better still.) Perhaps I'm misunderstanding your graph?\n\nI find your last point difficult to understand. Firstly, a 20 year old is not a \"child\". A differential wage for a 20 year old and a 21 year old, all other things being equal, doing the same job is clearly non-sensical. I appreciate older people tend to have more experience, but this is certainly not always the case. Secondly, and this is only my opinion, a person should be paid for the value of their labour, not for how long they've been alive or for their assumed experience. If a person has honed skills or had training and their labour results in greater value produced in the same period of time, then by all means pay them more. But simply saying \"You are young, therefore you deserve less\" is insulting and alienating. I wonder whether this is part of what's driving many young people into the arms of Corbyn. Lastly, young people will gain experience by working, as all of us do. But let's be realistic, most people spend the first few years of their working lives in menial jobs in which \"experience\" is unimportant contemporaneously and to their later lives. This \"experience\" argument seems like it may be true in some jobs, but is mostly used as a cover for paying less for the same work done. If my employer garnished my wages and told me they were being supplemented by \"experience\" that would benefit me in he vague future I'd take them to court.",

    "body": "Disclaimer: I'm an American too, so none of this is firsthand knowledge and I've only started following UK politics recently myself. I may have no idea what I'm talking about.\n\n**Tories/Conservatives**: The conservative party. They seem similar to pre-Obama Republicans, but minus most of the religious baggage. Back when Republicans were all-around pretty awful but hadn't gone completely insane yet.\n\n**Labour**: The liberal/progressive party. Kind of like the Democratic Party, up to and including the intraparty fighting. They're currently led by Jeremy Corbyn, whose closest American counterpart is Bernie Sanders, so basically imagine a Democratic Party if it aligned a lot more closely with the Sanders wing. \n\n**Liberal Democrats**: the centrist party. To be honest I'm not totally sure what they're all about, but I know not too long ago they formed a coalition with the Tories to keep Cameron in power, and that left them with a lot of baggage resulting from Tory policy they helped enact, and they subsequently lost most of their seats.\n\n**The Scottish National Party**: I think they're a generally left-leaning (since Scotland appears to be left-leaning) party whose foremost agenda item is Scottish independence. Some people are kinda pissed at them right now, since the left splitting votes between Labour and SNP led to the Tories taking a bunch of seats in Scotland. Which I guess would be sort of like a third party splitting votes with the Democrats all over the northeast, thus allowing a Republican to take a bunch of electoral votes in blue states in order to stay in power, even as the Democratic candidate won Ohio and Arizona\n\n**Democratic Unionist Party**: a bunch of religious nuts based out of Northern Ireland. This is the one party that appears to be actually as crazy as our tea party Republicans. They only have a handful of seats, but since the last election left Theresa May unable to form a sufficient majority with just the Conservatives, she formed a coalition with the DUP. Which means that, despite their few seats, they now have a weird position of prominence in national politics since if they stop playing ball with the conservatives they'll be left with a hung parliament. \n\n**Sinn Fein**: another party from Northern Ireland~~, but their primary issue is independence for Northern Ireland~~. They refuse to take an oath of service to the the UK, and as a result they do not take their seats in parliament. The practical effect of this is that it lowers the threshold required to form a majority. **EDIT:** correction by /u/passionfruitwriter: Also Sinn Fein don't want independence for Northern Ireland but rather unification with the Republic of Ireland.\n\n\nIf I've got any of this wrong, someone please correct me.",

On average, someone on a \u201czero-hours contract\u201d usually works 25 hours a week. Around one in three people (32%) on a \u201czero-hours contract\u201d want more hours, with most wanting them in their current job, as opposed to a different job which offers more hours. In comparison 9% of other people in employment wanted more hours.\"\n\n\n\"Around a third (32%) of people on \u201czero-hours contracts\u201d want more hours compared with 9% of people in employment not on a zero-hours contract, though this could be linked to a higher proportion of \u201czero-hours contract\u201d jobs being part-time. Looking in more detail, 9% of people on \u201czero-hours contracts\u201d would like a different job with more hours compared with 1% for other people in employment (the remainder would like more hours in their current job or an additional job) (Figure 9).\"\n\nhttps://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/earningsandworkinghours/articles/contractsthatdonotguaranteeaminimumnumberofhours/may2017\n\nSo if anything, it suggests that the majority (68%) are \"content\" at the least in the amount of hours they are receiving and thus not looking for more hours or a different job. Whether this is an endorsement for Zero Hours contracts on the whole, or just among the very specificpart of the workforce, for who it appears to be a good fit, is still very much up for debate.",

It's silly that a test at this age should determine their future, and unlikely that it provides a true measure of their academic potential \n* You can always tutor for any test. Parents with money will spend it to get their children into the grammar school, so the wealth divide doesn't go away - if anything, it's made worse since most of these parents wouldn't pay for a private school \n* Grammar schools tend to be in more affluent areas, so (at present) don't help with the \"postcode lottery\"\n* Grammar schools are seen as more desirable places to work, and as more deserving of good teachers, so they will tend to increase in quality at the expense of nearby comprehensives, deepening the divide \n* Creating a two-tiered system of more academic and less academic (read: vocational) schools will tend to result in grammar school students being pushed to go to uni, and students at comps being pushed into less academic jobs, even if this isn't what the student really wants or is capable of \n\nGrammar school students are already disproportionately represented at Russell Group universities, and I also know a lot of former grammar school students who suffer from anxiety and low self-esteem due to the high-achiever culture. \n\nNone of these problems are insurmountable, but I think that on the whole grammar schools exacerbate the divisions in our education system and aren't the way to fix it.

We will never know if he truly wanted to stay in the EU as we are not mind readers. \n\nRegardless of his *personal* like or dislike of the EU, his voting/personal record supports the theory that he wants what is best for the country/world, as a whole.

This a clear example of your voting/personal record not matching your words. \n\nI don't expect my prime minister to *personally* support/agree with everything they advocate for, but I DO expect everything they advocate for to be for our best interests, and for them to be as honest as they possibly can, where appropriate. \n\nIs this clearer for you now?",

    "body": "Went to a grammar school in North London, half white middle class and a half a mix of middle class and poor Asians. Real reason it was full of middle class kids was that there are basically only 3 for miles in north London meaning there's about 10 applicants to a place. Literally more competitive than some oxbridge courses. The current problems with the grammars exist due to the fact there's barely any of them so the upper middle classes use them as cut rate private schools (and then prop up their finances with donations because they've been deliberately starved by successive governments).\n\nThen again if the middle class kids failed to get in they'd just go to the selection-by-house price comps where you could rent a flat for 6 months for a cushy school place. The poor kids got left in the god awful comprehensives nearby if they failed.\n\nMore grammar schools and a requirement for some free school meal places would have fixed the situation. Abolishing grammars entirely would have just led to total apartheid where good teachers go to good schools in nice areas that you can only get into by having money. At least with grammars, truly bright kids can bridge the gap. In comprehensives it is impossible.\n\nAlso the reason they're over represented at Russell groups is because they're smarter. That's kind of the point. If this wasn't happening then the grammar schools would be a bit pointless.",

    "body": ">Children take the 11-plus when they're ten years old. It's silly that a test at this age should determine their future, and unlikely that it provides a true measure of their academic potential \n\nDon't test the intelligence of children, God damn it! Anything but that! Actually I don't think children can consent to tests, we should take our first tests at 18 and tentatively work from there.\n\n>You can always tutor for any test. Parents with money will spend it to get their children into the grammar school, so the wealth divide doesn't go away - if anything, it's made worse since most of these parents wouldn't pay for a private school \n\nMy mother paid for tutoring for me and she has had no paid work since about 2005. If parents really care about the school they they will pay for tutoring regardless of their social background. It's just that the proles have no interest in spending cigarette money on their children's future. With the advent of the internet it's even easier to access said services than it was at the time.\n\n>Grammar schools tend to be in more affluent areas, so (at present) don't help with the \"postcode lottery\"\n\nThis is true and it's a crying shame that Labour seem to prefer keeping it that way rather than spreading the ability for students everywhere to excel. For example in my area there was no Grammar School and no option to take the 11+ so I ended up going to a private school who only agreed to pay most of my fees and attending it wasn't based on merit unlike grammar schools but on whether you could pay the fees. Clearly having grammar schools available is the superior option.\n\n>Grammar schools are seen as more desirable places to work, and as more deserving of good teachers, so they will tend to increase in quality at the expense of nearby comprehensives, deepening the divide \n\nRich children learn how to behave from their well-educated parents. I'd tend to suggest that if teachers are exceptional then they deserve to teach children who are far less likely to misbehave. The divide to me is completely necessary - children who are destined to become bankers, lawyers, managers etc would have no recourse in a system where there were only regular secondaries. I went to a state primary school before my private secondary: the children are disruptive, sometimes deeply troubled - at least 3 of my classmates had one or more of their parents in prison. And that was a tiny village primary with relatively small classes once ranked in the top 10 in the county for state primaries. Because of the severe lack of grammar schools these children are already being punished by our system. We need more grammars to ensure the future of our services sector.\n\nThere is some social division as there always has been and always will be. Fucking over kids who excel is not the way to change this.  \n\n>Creating a two-tiered system of more academic and less academic (read: vocational) schools will tend to result in grammar school students being pushed to go to uni, and students at comps being pushed into less academic jobs, even if this isn't what the student really wants or is capable of \n\nDon't disagree with this. The solution is to provide grammar schools in all areas. Children with great marks go to great schools. Children who show no potential are given lesser opportunity to excel because they are not exceptional. It must be hard to understand but I'm sure you'll get it eventually when your children are forced to the local scummy secondary and you're desperately looking for private schools because the government was backed into a corner where they couldn't fund more grammars.\n\n>Grammar school students are already disproportionately represented at Russell Group universities, and I also know a lot of former grammar school students who suffer from anxiety and low self-esteem due to the high-achiever culture.\n\n>None of these problems are insurmountable, but I think that on the whole grammar schools exacerbate the divisions in our education system and aren't the way to fix it. \n\nIt would be wonderful to live in a society without challenges, right? Children should *clearly* not be ranked based on merit in order to better them and our own society. We can't hurt their *feelings*. ",

I'm not saying that's why your system costs more as a whole but it is part of the reason. Also you do not heavily subsidise nurse training through general taxation therefore, nurses get more in the long term as they have taken on more of a burden to become nurses in the first place.\n\nIt is also true that if we increased starting nurse pay (long term staff actually do get higher increases than 1%) to your level then our debt, which is already higher than yours, would reach unmanageable levels.\n\nOur systems are so different that comparing pay between the two just doesn't make sense.",

I'm actually in favour of testing, in order to ensure that schools meet standards and no child is let down by poor teaching.

Today it seems the PM can, if they choose, lead the government in an almost presidential fashion. They appoint the Cabinet, and then the PM and members of that Cabinet can set policy and make major executive decisions with relatively little input from and oversight by Parliament as a whole.\n\nConsequently a lot of people choose how to vote for their constituency MP not based on the candidates but based on which party they belong to and who the current leader is. The last general election was obviously all about Corbyn for Labour, and the Tory campaign hardly even seemed to mention being the Conservatives on a lot of their propaganda, only Theresa May. However, if that leader then changes mid-term, much of what people chose to vote for potentially disappears, and they might even get someone they were explicitly promised they weren't voting for.\n\nSo I agree that severing the implicit link between choosing the PM and choosing a local MP would be a good thing. I think it would improve the accountability of the PM and executive, ensure that anyone becoming PM did have an explicit popular mandate, and mean voters could also choose a good local representative based on more than the colour of their flyers.",

It benefits the country as a whole to put more resources into more intelligent children and not to spread resources for children who have no interest in education or no special talent. \n\n>We don't take other tests with similar consequences until we're 16, and hopefully much more mature. \n\nHow mature you are has no real bearing on how well you do in a test when compared relatively to other young children. With the same line of argument you could say that testing at 16 is unfair because some children are far more mature at 16 than others (girls specifically). Testing is always going to massively screw children who aren't clever. But lack of adequate testing at 10-11 massively screws over children who show levels of promise above their peers, and these children who show promise should be first on the agenda.",

Nor is it the fault of said children for being disruptive rather than cooperative. It's mostly upbringing and children of that age usually haven't made many independent choices yet. But punishing high achievers with mediocre teaching, mediocre resources, mediocre classmates who might damage the learning environment etc is not the answer. Intelligent children of all backgrounds need access to free grammars.",
