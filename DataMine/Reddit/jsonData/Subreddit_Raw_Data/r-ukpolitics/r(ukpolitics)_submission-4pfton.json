He reckons Ronny got hammered off the big lads every lunch break cos he had big fucking skidmarks in his yfronts when he got changed for swimming !! .. So that sort of explains his infamous dark side .. also the Pickerings were in hiding for years after that carry on with the dog video.. People from Hull wil know what I mean\ufeff",
