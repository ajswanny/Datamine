I don't feel comfortable telling others how they should be governed. I may regret it...\n\nSo, when the British PM announced the general election I thought I'd read up on who is eligibile to vote. I was lucky enough to be born in the UK and even though I haven't lived there for over 7 years and I have no intention of ever living in the UK again I am still allowed to have a say in the future govt. Meanwhile, millions of people who have made the UK their home aren't given the same privilege. \n\nI didn't believe it, either, so I applied for my voting papers and yes, I received them. BUT, after much soul searching, I've chosen not to vote. I don't think I'm up with the play of who/where/what when it comes to the various parties; but I also don't feel right having a say in the lives of people half a world away. \n\nBy contrast, all permanent residents living in NZ can vote while citizens who have been away for more than three years cannot. Citizens of other countries that have lived in NZ for 12 months or more like Cook Islanders Maori, Australians, Niueans and Tokelauans are also eligible to vote, and they don't need a visa to be here - they live in NZ in a similar way that EU citizens live in the UK - they've chosen to make NZ their home so they get a say in how that home is run. Seems far more civilised, to me. \n\nI wish the British public well. I may regret not voting, but for now it seems the more moral thing to do.",

Mr Rahman was voted as Mayor of Tower Hamlets back in 2015. He was prosecuted for several offences (the 'treating' offence wasn't proved). \n\nClosing statement from the judge:\n\n> 685 On past form, it appears inevitable that Mr Rahman will denounce this judgment as yet another example of the racism and Islamophobia that have hounded him throughout his political life. It is nothing of the sort. Mr Rahman has made a successful career by ignoring or flouting the law (as this Petition demonstrates) and has relied on silencing his critics by accusations of racism and Islamophobia. But his critics have not been silenced and neither has this court.\n\n> 686 Events of recent months in contexts very different from electoral malpractice have starkly demonstrated what happens when those in authority are afraid to confront wrongdoing for fear of allegations of racism and Islamophobia. Even in the multicultural society which is 21st century Britain, the law must be applied fairly and equally to everyone. Otherwise we are lost. \n\n(I haven't got a particular agenda! Just thought it was interesting given recent events and topics of conversation, and this was a coincidence!)\n\nEdit: BTW, your knowledge of obscure election laws is pub-quiz winning level! ",

(or don't... probably going to be banned) You're absolutely right!\n\nI was going to reply back to you saying 'oh no, you're mistaken! The only requirement is to put an age filter on the service!'\n\nBut I'm wrong... The law is plain - 'extreme pornographic content' is identified by the commission, and then a notice is sent to the ISP who has to ban access to *all UK residents* to the content.\n\nBear in mind, however, **this is not yet in force!** There is no commencement order for it yet.\n\nSaying that, it isn't actually inconsistent with current law. It is *already* an offence to posses 'extreme pornographic content' in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland (Scotland must have a slightly different law).\n\n**S.63 Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008** describes 'extreme' in relation to pornographic images as:\n \n> (7) An image falls within this subsection if it portrays, in an explicit and realistic way, any of the following\u2014\n\n> (a) an act which threatens a person's life,\n\n> (b) an act which results, or is likely to result, in serious injury to a person's anus, breasts or genitals,\n\n> (c) an act which involves sexual interference with a human corpse, or\n\n> (d) a person performing an act of intercourse or oral sex with an animal (whether dead or alive),\n\n> and a reasonable person looking at the image would think that any such person or animal was real.\n\n> (7A) An image falls within this subsection if it portrays, in an explicit and realistic way, either of the following\u2014\n\n> (a) an act which involves the non-consensual penetration of a person's vagina, anus or mouth by another with the other person's penis, or\n\n> (b) an act which involves the non-consensual sexual penetration of a person's vagina or anus by another with a part of the other person's body or anything else,\n\n> and a reasonable person looking at the image would think that the persons were real.\n\n >(7B) For the purposes of subsection (7A)\u2014\n\n> (a) penetration is a continuing act from entry to withdrawal;\n \n>(b) \u201cvagina\u201d includes vulva.\n \nI.e. 'rape' porn (even if acted) is illegal, as is bestiality and extreme BDSM. However, you currently have to 'own' these images. \n\nThe new law would make it so that ISPs would have to stop access to this material at source.\n\nAlso, N.B. S. 5A (b)\n\nAs well as the list above, there's a 'catch-all' definition of any content that **\"is grossly offensive, disgusting or otherwise of an obscene character\".**\n\nA nice broad-brush rule! I wonder who's going to decide when *that* rule applies!? \n\nLiberal thinkers with a love for personal freedom and sexual expression I presume!",
