Now they dislike her, and probably think they can push her around due to gaffs on the campaign trail that have undermined her authority (the social care U-turn and sending a proxy to debates being the key two).\n\nHonestly I hope Corbyn gets in over her as I don't think he has had his authority undermined in quite the same way, and I don't think the EU leaders have so much of a personal bias against him. While you would hope EU leaders would be able to rise above a dislike of May, I still imagine it would factor in and we'll get a worse deal under May than we would do Corbyn.",

    "body": "I don't really see what the point of this post is. It has a lot of upvotes because it's anti-conservative and that seems to be the prevailing mood on this subreddit at the moment... but the point of the GE was never to 'intimidate' other global leaders with the magnitude of Theresa May's big throbbing mandate or her domestic political expertise. To cast it in some perspective, do you care that Donald Trump has an electoral mandate when you criticize him? - of course you don't. \n\nI think the EU should probably learn a few things from this GE;\n\n* The highest point of the entire campaign for May was when Juncker clumsily leaked that meeting to a German newspaper and thought he could outplay May using the British press (who were obviously going to pick up the story). What he didn't appreciate was that the British press are incredibly bloodthirsty and they aren't exactly sympathetic to him (indeed most of the papers have been vilifying Juncker for some time now). The lesson there was that you don't wade cock deep into someone elses political arena (in this case the British press) and expect to out-play them at it. The government very smoothly turned the story around and used it as evidence of the EU's intransigence to accept Brexit.\n\n* Brexit hasn't really dominated this election in the way most people assumed it would... and that is because the two parties that can win the election both back Brexit. Indeed the difference on their EU policy is outwardly miniscule - May argues we should be strong and stable, whilst Corbyn argues we need to be stable and strong. This is backed up by domestic polling data which shows the public continue to support Brexit... in effect Brexit has become 'old news' because people have accepted that it has to happen and it is going to happen. \n\n* A broader lesson for politicians around the world is to remember a political fundamental lesson: domestic political issues generally trump global issues. The reason the Conservatives and Lib dems have suffered is because they have tried to fight a GE on an international issue of Brexit whereas Corbyn has exceeded expectations because he has fought on a domestic political agenda of public sector reforms and an end to the deeply unpopular period of austerity.\n\nIt might also be worth pointing one small detail out: **Theresa May is almost certainly still going to win this election**. So how well Corbyn did is likely to become pretty moot other than in the ensuing labour leadership challenge.",

If anything I think the various gaffes and fiascos of this election will embolden them to squeeze her on various terms. \n\nIf she walks away the EU will be hurt, this is true. However, they understand from the outset that their leverage is much heavier than hers. Without any kind of deal at all the UK will be under WTO trade standards and our goods will get squeezed with tarriffs where before there were none. Air traffic will come to a halt as previous agreements on unrestricted air access are torn up. The absense of border agreements will strangle trade with not only the 27 countries of the EU, but further abroad too. Japan has voiced their grievances, threatening a sharp loss of investment if Britain cannot retain access to the single market. America has already shown it's priorities in favouring a deal with the EU over Britain, for whom it's off to the back of the queue again. The question of security is also one where they hold all the cards, with Macron suggesting that moving border controls currently in place at Calais over to the UK may become a condition to any border deal.\n\nWanna know the best part of all? EU countries have a convenient patsy for any damage caused to their economies by brexit. Theresa May has repeatedly gone on record saying no deal is better than a bad deal and that she'll be \"a bloody difficult woman\". She's lined herself up for taking on all the blame for whatever consequences come from negotiations whether she walks away from the negotiating table or not.",

EU citizens will get a reciprocal deal, I don't see the EU bending over backwards for this.\n\nAs for the last two points - The UK banking establishment will be devestated by Brexit, not that I think that is necessarily too bad.

So whilst she might have spaffed a 22 point lead up the wall, she's very politically astute because this was always a win-win election for the conservatives and people have forgotten that. It has also given the conservatives an opportunity to gain a new electoral mandate under May for reforms to areas like social care and the implementation of Brexit - this way labour cannot use it as a stick to beat the conservatives in 2020.

    "body": "If you're talking about the Cameron talks pre the referendum then it's significant even if people didn't pay much attention to them because they were what swung Boris to campaign for leave. (He was still on the fence till those talks). Many would argue that he was the key player in securing that slim leave majority. If he'd decided to campaign for Remain I doubt Gove and IDS would have been able to carry the leave campaign to victory. I'm pretty sure the Big Red NHS Bus was a Johnson idea.\n\nIn terms of the upcoming talks we don't really know what to expect from May. \"The best deal for britain\" is a pretty vague statement. I think a lot of the hard brexiteers pushing to give her a \"strong hand in the negotiations\" might be surprised to learn that what she considers to be the \"best deal\" is nothing like what they insisted they voted for last June. (Even though the ballot paper didn't have any of those things on it.) I wouldn't be surprised if the vagueness of that \"best deal\" statement sees UKIP pick up more votes than the polls are suggesting. As much as I disagree with Nuttel I think he's actually campaigned well and kept his composure during the main media events. ",

That the world would inexorably merge into a European Union, and an African Union, and an Islamic Caliphate. It would be like Huntingdon's Clash of Civilizations.\n\nBut I now see this as a bit far-fetched. Let's face it - the British Isles are full of tubby, pasty, gingery men standing in pubs, playing snooker, and talking earnestly about how they're too different from the English/Irish/Scots/Welsh to live under the same government.\n\nIf people who are essentially identical can feel so different from one another, then how is a European Union, or an Asian Union, or an African Union ever going to work? \n\nWhat we'll find is that these unions are weak and dysfunctional, because they can only move very tentatively, particularly when confronted by big homogeneous countries like Russia. An American from Seattle can meet an American from Miami and there's immediate mutual recognition as Americans. A person from Ireland is unlikely ever to feel the same way about someone from Greece or Estonia. \n\nDefence-wise, Britain is an island stuck in the Atlantic, far from Russia, North Korea or Iran. Our only major military threat would be if the EU united against us, for some reason, but nuclear weapons and global alliances have made this a lot less concerning than it would have been a century ago. \n\nAs for the bankers, I agree that the City of London is likely to get smaller, though it won't be devastated - it predates the EU by many centuries. But this shrinkage is really the only way the rest of the British economy can grow - the City creates a Dutch Disease that keeps Sterling too high for our other exports to be competitive. \n\nAnd I disagree that fish are worthless. On the contrary, cod are quite valuable objects. Iceland's GDP per capita is not far below's Britain's, even though fish is virtually all they have. ",

As you can see, Jaguar sits above VW, BMW-MINI, Audi, and Mercedes, all of which are in the bottom half of the table. How does that make them \"better\"\n\n http://www.autoexpress.co.uk/car-news/consumer-news/91220/the-most-and-least-reliable-car-manufacturers-2016\n\nTariffs act as a stupidity tax on people who don't bother to check this information.",

But the requirements to do so are far, far too high for me to hope so.\n\nTo start, we'd need a PM willing to say 'actually, we're going to ignore the referendum and stay in the EU' - legally possible, it was only an advisory referendum, but politically... challenging (no doubt Sir Humphrey Appelby would describe it as 'courageous')\n\nThen you would (almost certainly) need an act of Parliament to revoke the notification, which would need a majority of MPs to agree to ignore the referendum result - again, legal but politically difficult for them, especially given how all the tabloids will be screaming their heads off to the large portion of voters that for some reason believes what they read in them.\n\nThen you'd need every single member state to agree to allow the UK to stay, either unconditionally or with additional terms. I don't see, for example, Spain allowing it without at least attempting to get some sort of concession regarding Gibraltar. And as I said before, we've dragged our heels for decades; demanding exceptions and opt-outs to otherwise universal rules like the Euro, or the Schengen Area, or the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, or the area of freedom, security and justice (AFSJ).\n\nTL;DR: would love to stay, but there's a whopping huge mountain of tangled politics standing between us and the goal.",

The last time labour tried to hammer home the same candidate (Kinnock) despite him losing elections it kept them out of power for a decade. As soon as labour changed candidate (first to Smith who unexpectedly died before the next GE, and then to Blair) they won... and they won by a landslide.  \n\nIf Corbyn has a chance, then his chance is now. If Corbyn fucks this up the left of the labour party should seriously consider rethinking their approach. His ideas have been popular but he has been unpopular - they need to decide what is more important; seeing their policies implemented or retaining their party leader in opposition.",

It provides no guarantee that voters will be given a new say if their MP changes allegiance or, crucially, if the PM steps down and someone new and potentially very different takes control of what is effectively our executive branch.\n\nWhen someone like Gordon Brown or Theresa May reaches such high office without a vote, there is always a complaint from those who don't like them that it's undemocratic. There is always a response from their supporters that of course it's democratic because people voted for their MP, invariably ignoring details like the MP running on the platform of a certain party whose leader was known at that time and expected to serve for the full length of the next parliament.
