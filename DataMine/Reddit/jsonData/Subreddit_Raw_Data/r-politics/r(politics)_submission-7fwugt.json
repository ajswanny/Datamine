    "body": "Figuring out the best way to act can be difficult. Here's a nice concise look at the FCC as well as who you can contact about net neutrality:\n\n\nHere is the information to contact your representatives in congress about it. You can find them and their contact information at this website: https://www.congress.gov/members.\nYou can find your senate members here: https://www.senate.gov/senators/contact/.\nThis vote isn't entirely up to Ajit Pai. It takes a 3 vote majority of the 5 member committee to go through.\n\nYou can find those 5 members here: https://www.fcc.gov/about/leadership.\n\n\nA quick breakdown:\n\nAjit Pai: His vote will be to approve the repeal.\n\nMignon Clyburn. One of the people who first voted to approve net neutrality.\n\nJessica Rosenworcel is a Democrat, and the other person currently on the council who voted for net neutrality.\n\nMichael O'Rielly. One of the people who first voted against net neutrality when it was passed. He's the key and has the highest likelihood of being swayed. His contact information is on the website. It\u2019s worth taking the time to email, fax, and call his offices. Here is a direct link to his email: https://www.fcc.gov/about/leadership/mike-orielly?qt-leadership_tabs=6&status=1.\n\nBrendan Carr. Hand picked by Trump to back up Pai in repealing net neutrality. He's also worked for ISPs in the past. Smaller chance of him voting against the repeal, but it wouldn't hurt to contact him as well. Here is a direct link to his email: https://www.fcc.gov/about/leadership/brendan-carr?qt-leadership_tabs=6&status=1.\n\n\nSome people aren't aware of what it means if net neutrality goes away. ISPs (Comcast, AT&T, etc.) will be able to do three things:\n\n1. charge you for internet packages on top of your monthly fee. If you want social media, that's $5.00 more. News sites are $5.00 more. This is what that looks like: https://imgur.com/gallery/9LEUP.\n\n2. charge content providers (website owners) extra to use a fast lane. If they don't pay in, their content will feel slower. Think loading content on a slow cell phone vs. on your laptop/desktop on your home wifi.\n\n3. decide what you see and how quickly you see it. If Comcast launches it's own search engine, they can prevent you from seeing Google. If they launch their own chat app, they can slow down iMessages, Skype, Google Chat, Slack, etc. The one that is most likely and would have a greater impact: if they choose to, they can slow down Netflix, Hulu, etc., and even charge you more for streaming movies and TV.",

The non-payers will be relegated to baths and waiting for the water to drip out to boil the noodles. First you have to boil the water to make sure it's clean because you can't afford the cleanness service, so you have to boil it first to make it clean, then boil the noodles in it.\n\nAnd you have to do this because the other water company doesn't service your area, and even if they did, they have the same fee model as the one you currently have.\n\nWhy do they do this? It isn't good for the community?\n\nWell Dick WaterWiggler is making tons of money by doing this, and the executives immediately below him get a share. So why would they stop? They have good, clean water, hot water, and good water pressure, and they can afford it. And if you pull yourself up by the bootstraps, you can have clean water, hot and cold, and any pressure you want!

That meant that Comcast wouldn't block or throttle lawful Internet traffic and that it wouldn't create fast lanes in order to collect tolls from Web companies that want priority access over the Comcast network.\n\nThis was one of the ways in which Comcast argued that the Federal Communications Commission should not reclassify broadband providers as common carriers, a designation that forces ISPs to treat customers fairly in other ways. The Title II common carrier classification that makes net neutrality rules enforceable isn't necessary because ISPs won't violate net neutrality principles anyway, Comcast and other ISPs have claimed.\n\nBut with Republican Ajit Pai now in charge at the Federal Communications Commission, Comcast's stance has changed. While the company still says it won't block or throttle Internet content, it has dropped its promise about not instituting paid prioritization.",

People continue to point out the Net Neutrality aspect of this, which is very important, but they fail to understand that the major item at hand is Title II itself.\n\n>Title II enables the FCC to enact price controls in the event of gouging and the forcing of Open Access Networks (OANs) among other things. OANs are how AOL and other dial-up internet services formed in the 90s as phone lines fall under this regulation and thus AOL did not need to own its own phone lines, it was allowed to piggyback off of infrastructure already existing. The FCC could decide to at some point enact this over broadband home internet to increase competition, as various European countries have, to drop prices and increase speeds/offerings.\n\n>The item of price controls could come into play as Muricans are already charged the highest prices in the modern world for internet on a $/Mb (dollar per megabit) scale. Again, at some point (after enough complaints, maybe) the FCC could decide to start regulating what ISPs are allowed to charge us to stop the gouging. Prices are already destined and set to continually increase on home broadband due to the vast numbers of people cutting the cord. These companies all typically have cable TV offerings and even channels, and they need to make up for the lost revenue. Price gouging will only get worse.\n\n>The telecoms / ISPs despise these possibilities and they want to nip it in the butt before it can actually happen once progressives start running the gubberment / FCC. This is exactly why the corrupt Repubelican FCC (Ashit Pie) is dismantling Title II. This is why this FCC is also preempting state privacy laws, it is the ISPs getting ahead of legitimate future governments in the event they actually want to stand up for and protect the citizens of this country.\n\n",

There will be boycotts, cancellations, and social movements started in protest of the change.\n\nBut none of that will happen to the consumer.  No, the media companies are too clever for that.  Short term profits wouldn't nearly be as good as longterm ones.  They'll charge the companies to keep their bandwidth the same, which has been their plan all along.  Once the other companies, who are much more profitable than Comcast or Time Werner, start having to pay collection fees to the big telcoms, then those companies will start passing the buck onto their consumers.\n\nSpotify will increase to $12 a month\n\nPandora will match them\n\nNetflix will go from $7.99 to $9.99.\n\nAnd the ads will be even worse than how.  Ad agencies, knowing that companies will have an even harder time turning a profit, will buy adspace from these content providers who will be eager to keep themselves out of the red without upsetting their customers.\n\nAnd sure, people might be disgruntled at Comcast for lobbying against net neutrality, but they'll totally forget it if they can complain about the cost of all their services go up, which they'll grudgingly admit that its just \"inflation\" or that the content providers really did need to raise prices to meet demand.\n\nAnd nobody will be the wiser.

The problem isn't the size of the government, in my opinion; it's the inefficiency and corruption that has become pervasive. We need more oversight and accountability. I think we need a referendum option for leaders who we find are working against public interest. \n\nThe government being big isn't such a problem if they're more accountable to their constituents. At the moment, the only thing they seem to fear is losing the next election, but if they're also at risk of being removed while in office for demonstrably working against public interest they might think twice before screwing us over. In other words, I think making a large government more accountable preserves the benefits of having it while addressing a lot of the problems we're having. \n\nHopefully this stream-of-thought comment makes sense.
