Second, it implicates the president himself.

I truly believe at this point it isn't if Trump gets impeached it's how many will go down with him.  How many GOP reps knew and/or are involved in at least covering up.  How many business deals did he do that involved Russian money.  Who else did those Russians deal with.  How many lawyers or tax firms are involved.  If worst case is Trump was actively involved with illegal Russian money for years its likely other top real estate firms will get caught up in this.  The final outcome could take a decade it could potentially be the largest legal case in US history.  It is likely much bigger than Enron.

No one other than the reporters and Trump had been in the office. And Trump never signaled the drink request to anyone outside the office.\n\nSounds like at least several important parts of Trump Tower are bugged by Trump. I would be shocked if he hadn't at least heard the meeting.",

Cutting off funding to those clinics can mean that people with no resources have to travel hundreds of miles for basic health care.  Fortunately other countries are trying to pick up the slack in funding this time, to keep clinics running in those areas.  \n\nBut every time the administration changes, the news on this issue is either \"new president wants to kill poor women!\" or \"new president paying for abortion with your tax dollars!\" It's a ping pong match that's been going on for at least twenty years.\n\n",

    "body": "I'm not sure anyone's actually answered your question yet.\n\nFranks is talking about the [Mexico City policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico_City_policy), also known as the global gag rule.\n\nThe policy blocks federal funding for NGOs that provide abortion services, counseling, or referrals overseas. So not just abortions themselves, but counseling about abortion or referrals to other NGOs that perform abortions.\n\nThe policy has some wideranging and harmful global health effects, but before I get into that, I want to provide a little more context for Franks's remarks.\n\nFederal funding of abortion domestically is prevented by [the Hyde Amendment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyde_Amendment) and federal funding of abortion overseas is prevented by [the Helms Amendment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helms_Amendment). The Helms Amendment has been in effect since 1973. The Mexico City policy was instituted in 1984 not to prevent federal funding of abortions (because the Helms Amendment already did that) but to prevent federally funded NGOs from even *talking* about abortions, hence why the Mexico City policy is often referred to as the global gag rule.\n\nSince Reagan instituted the policy in 1984, it has become normal for presidents to rescind or reinstate it as one of their first acts in office. So Clinton rescinded it in January 1993, Bush reinstated it in January 2001, Obama rescinded it in January 2009, and Trump reinstated it in January 2017.\n\nIt's political football, but there are real stakes for women overseas.\n\nFirst, [the Mexico City policy has actually been linked to an increase in abortions](http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/89/12/11-091660/en/). This seems counter-intuitive, but what happens is that when NGOs lose federal funding because they talk about abortions, it affects the other services they provide, like contraception. NGOs have fewer resources to devote to contraception, which in turn increases unwanted pregnancies, which results in an increase in abortions that the contraception would have prevented.\n\nThe increase in abortions is ironic, but the second issue with the Mexico City policy is pretty horrific. Because the policy increases unwanted pregnancy while removing scarce reproductive resources, women have fewer options, and under those circumstances they often opt for unsafe abortions. Marie Stopes International estimates that [the reinstatement of the Mexico City policy during Trump's first term will result in 6.5 million unwanted pregnancies and 2.2 million abortions, of which 2.1 million will be unsafe. As a result of the spike in unsafe abortions, Marie Stopes International estimates that 21,700 women will die](https://www.mariestopes.org/what-we-do/our-approach/policy-and-advocacy/the-mexico-city-policy-a-world-without-choice/).\n\nThe Mexico City policy has other unintended consequences as well, such as [limiting funding for HIV prevention](https://www.allure.com/story/anti-abortion-global-gag-rule-expansion-consequences).\n\nAs we've seen with Planned Parenthood funding in the United States, if you defund organizations that talk about abortion, it doesn't just affect their ability to talk about abortion. It affects their entire budget, including all of the other health care services they provide. It hurts women and their children, which is the opposite of pro-life.",

Extreme religious people take the Bible as completely true, and shape their world that they see to fit the \"truth\" that they see in it, mastering mental gymnastics. This differs from people who are more middle ground religious, or not religious at all, especially scientists in the sense that the latter groups would often try to take nothing to be set as true, and only look to observe and question every part.\n\nIf you have a group that has established that they will fight tooth and nail to bend logic to make the world fit a book, you can use that same trait and take advantage of it to have them believe whatever gets you more power and money, and not only believe it but use the same evangelism to force others to believe it",

    "body": ">How could that change the circumstances of her husband's death?\n\nJury trials are all about sympathy, because inherent in any jury trial is some version of the Plaintiff's argument \"Mr. Smith deserves justice, we can't give him his life back, that's impossible, all the law allows is for us to come to court and ask you to award compensation, so we ask you to award Mr. Smith $1 million from the defendant.\"   \n\nThe defendant always has in their pocket \"this is all about money.\"  Sometimes it makes you look tacky and horrible, but sometimes it's a good argument. \n\nI'll give you a snippet from a closing argument a senior partner gave in one of my first trials. \n\nIt was a wrongful death case against a grocery store and the company that manufactured its automatic doors. An old lady had been walking into the store and triggered the automatic doors they opened, she started walking through, and they started to close, it scared her and she fell. She broke her hip and died in the hospital less than a week later.  \n\nExcept the proof that came out was that she was virtually estranged from her family.  The adult son that would be the beneficiary of her estate couldn't even be bothered to come to the trial. \n\nThe partner that tried this case structured his closing argument like this:  (paraphrased). \n\n\"Ladies and gentlemen, Ms. Smith death is a tragedy.  I profoundly wish it hadn't happened. But just because she slipped and fell, does not mean it's anyone's fault.   The proof shows you...(blah blah, the door had safety mechanisms, it wouldn't have closed, it had clearance per all standards etc.) \n\nWhile you consider this case, there's something else I want you to think about.  Who is the Plaintiff in this case?  The Plaintiff is the estate of Ethel Smith. That means that if you give them any money, it will go to Ms. Smith's estate.  Have you seen anyone here on behalf of the estate?  Because when I look at that counsel table, I see a banker and a lawyer.  *(at this point I just about lost my shit, but apparently plaintiff' counsel was distracted and didn't object).*",

But what about situations where attorneys are *clearly* spinning something they know has to be utterly false? In your experience are those a situation of a lawyer who's compromising his own ethics by telling his client something to the effect of \"I don't want to hear about it, I'm stepping out of the room\" a la Saul Goodman, or do some of those situations involve the attorney and client actively working together to push a lie? I'm trying to think of relevant current examples, but I guess the Casey Anthony trial comes to mind (maybe even the OJ case but that had an octupus of other factors of the era). Basically, I never bought Jose Baez believed what he was saying. You think Anthony told him she did it and he constructed the bizarre theory around it, or he actually believed her story, or somewhere in the middle?\n\nApologies I know this isn't an AMA.

    "body": "> I cannot, for the love of me understand how could people vote for that piece of shit.\n\nI wasn't following politics too closely at the time.\n\nThe FBI was still investigating Clinton.  From my POV both candidates sucked and the less shitty one had an ongoing federal case which was enough (at the time, for what I knew) for me to rule her out.\n\nThis was my third presidential election, and the first in which **I did not vote for a president**.  (I voted on everything else on the ballot, researched the state/county propositions, a cursory glance over the state representatives was all that was required, etc.)\n\nI can personally understand someone going for a more drastic swing decision \"holy shit my choices are being investigated by the FBI, or this crazy guy.\"  I chose to not make a decision between the two at all. \n\n\nI can understand how people could begrudgingly vote for that piece of shit.\n\n----\n\n\n\n\nThings I've learned since then:\n\n* The president alone has way too much fucking power.\n* The president alone has *way too much fucking power.*\n* Congress majority can be corrupt and is not a reliable check on the president.\n* The president alone has **way too much fucking power.**\n* (As a \"cord cutter\" with no cable or broadcast news, my politics information was extremely limited because I was not specifically seeking it out.  I'm not on facebook, or twitter, or exposed to \"fake news\" and all that crap that would have piqued my attention.)\n\nI had the thought that, oh, he's saying stupid shit, but whatever, checks and balances, a cabinet of people that have a clue.  His dumb shit (the wall etc.) will get checked by congress.  Maybe he'll spew some nonsense and people around him that have a clue will form some sort of interesting but reasonable change out of what was said.\n\n\nI've learned a lot since November.  I'm lucky that I'm not forced to work two jobs with kids etc. and have time to stay up with the news and educate myself now.  I feel fortunate I have time to learn and observe about how stuff works in the real world now, and not just what I was taught formally.  My state went blue by a decent margin, and this was a (thankfully safe) wakeup call for me.\n\nAlso, hindsight is 20/20.  What we're learning on a daily basis is progressively worse than the day before.  Which is to say we knew little to none of this prior to the election.  People may have expected a shitshow, but I don't think anyone could *honestly* say that they fully expected that it would truly turn out to be *this* bad.\n\nSo there is my true \"confession.\"  I can understand why people voted for Trump.",
