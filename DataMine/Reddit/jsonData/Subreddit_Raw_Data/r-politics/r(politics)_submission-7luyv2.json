Those in the room at the signing of the Declaration of Independence were far wealthier than the \"common man.\" And what we really declared independence over was the enforcement of existing taxes from Britain, which paid for a war that the American people started with Western expansion, and were levied at a much lower rate than on the people of Britain proper. At least, I assume that's what revolution you are referring to. The better comparison would be the French Revolution.",

When he ran his numbers he was going to be saving about $150/year. I told him I'd rather the government keep my $3k and put it to good use in rebuilding out infrastructure, ensuring social programs we're funded to work well, or to even give lower income earners like him a bigger tax break as $3k would mean a lot more to someone in a lower tax bracket that it means to me, but the party he voted for determined that I already pay my fair share and clearly he hasn't been pulling his weight. This did not make him happy and he said that he was told this tax break would help the middle class. I lol'd and told him according to his party *I am* the middle class and he is the lower class that doesn't pay their fair share but not too worry because I'm sure it will trickle down to him when the stock buybacks and mergers start happening due to this tax savings for businesses and the high income earners.",

It is in fact a crime for an American to be poor, even though America is a nation of poor. \n\n>Every other nation has folk traditions of men who were poor but extremely wise and virtuous, and therefore more estimable than anyone with power and gold. No such tales are told by the American poor. They mock themselves and glorify their betters.\n\n>The meanest eating or drinking establishment, owned by a man who is himself poor, is very likely to have a sign on its wall asking this cruel question: 'if you\u2019re so smart, why ain\u2019t you rich?' There will also be an American flag no larger than a child\u2019s hand \u2013 glued to a lollipop stick and flying from the cash register.\n\n>Americans, like human beings everywhere, believe many things that are obviously untrue. Their most destructive untruth is that it is very easy for any American to make money. They will not acknowledge how in fact hard money is to come by, and, therefore, those who have no money blame and blame and blame themselves.\n\n>This inward blame has been a treasure for the rich and powerful, who have had to do less for their poor, publicly and privately, than any other ruling class since, say Napoleonic times. Many novelties have come from America. The most startling of these, a thing without precedent, is a mass of undignified poor. They do not love one another because they do not love themselves.",

    "body": "Daily reminder: [Trump\u2019s Russian Laundromat story from The New Republic](https://newrepublic.com/article/143586/trumps-russian-laundromat-trump-tower-luxury-high-rises-dirty-money-international-crime-syndicate). Pretty much lists all the evidence needed to think the entire Trump Org is a front for Russians.  \n  \nedit: I'll add in some excerpts:  \n  \nedit 2: Rybolovlev  \n\n>If the transaction seemed suspicious\u2014**multiple apartments for a single buyer who appeared to have no legitimate way to put his hands on that much money\u2014there may have been a reason. At the time, Russian mobsters were beginning to invest in high-end real estate, which offered an ideal vehicle to launder money from their criminal enterprises.** \u201cDuring the \u201980s and \u201990s, we in the U.S. government repeatedly saw a pattern by which criminals would use condos and high-rises to launder money,\u201d says Jonathan Winer, a deputy assistant secretary of state for international law enforcement in the Clinton administration. \u201cIt didn\u2019t matter that you paid too much, because the real estate values would rise, and it was a way of turning dirty money into clean money. It was done very systematically, and it explained why there are so many high-rises where the units were sold but no one is living in them.\u201d **When Trump Tower was built, as David Cay Johnston reports in The Making of Donald Trump, it was only the second high-rise in New York that accepted anonymous buyers**.  \n  \nReferring to Russian gangster David Bogatin, who purchased 5 condos in Trump Tower with illegally earned money. Also keep in mind, Trump's [record sale of Palm Beach property Maison de l'Amitie to Dmitry Rybolovlev for double Trump's purchase price](http://www.chicagotribune.com/classified/realestate/ct-donald-trump-mansion-and-the-russian-fertilizer-king-20170306-story.html) in the middle of the 2008 housing crisis. Which Rybolovlev had promptly bulldozed and resold without ever stepping foot on said property. The amount that Trump sold the property for is also nearly the [same amount that he owed Deutsche Bank](http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/12/guide-donald-trump-debt/). Rybolovlev is now being investigated [in his current home state Monaco](https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-dollar450-million-da-vinci-and-the-dollar1-billion-art-fraud) for fraud over that DaVinci painting he sold a few months ago that everyone freaked out about. And mind you, Monaco is one of those states notorious for money laundering, like Luxembourg, the Channel Islands, Panama, Ireland, etc. \n  \n>Trump had found his market. After Trump World Tower opened, Sotheby\u2019s International Realty teamed up with a Russian real estate company to make a big sales push for the property in Russia. The \u201ctower full of oligarchs,\u201d as Bloomberg called it, became a model for Trump\u2019s projects going forward. All he needed to do, it seemed, was slap the Trump name on a big building, and high-dollar customers from Russia and the former Soviet republics were guaranteed to come rushing in. Dolly Lenz, a New York real estate broker, told USA Today that she sold some 65 units in Trump World Tower to Russians. \u201cI had contacts in Moscow looking to invest in the United States,\u201d Lenz said. \u201cThey all wanted to meet Donald.\u201d\n\n>To capitalize on his new business model, Trump struck a deal with a Florida developer to attach his name to six high-rises in Sunny Isles, just outside Miami. **Without having to put up a dime of his own money, Trump would receive a cut of the profits. \u201cRussians love the Trump brand,\u201d Gil Dezer, the Sunny Isles developer, told Bloomberg. A local broker told The Washington Post that one-third of the 500 apartments he\u2019d sold went to \u201cRussian-speakers.\u201d So many bought the Trump-branded apartments, in fact, that the area became known as \u201cLittle Moscow.**\u201d  \n  \nIt's so out there in the open. No wonder why Trump is such a nervous wreck.  \n  \n>**Trump promoted and celebrated the properties**. His organization continues to advertise the units; in 2011, when they first turned a profit, he attended a ceremonial mortgage-burning in Sunny Isles to toast their success. **Last October, an investigation by the Miami Herald found that at least 13 buyers in the Florida complex have been the target of government investigations, either personally or through their companies, including \u201cmembers of a Russian-American organized crime group.\u201d Two buyers in Sunny Isles, Anatoly Golubchik and Michael Sall, were convicted for taking part in a massive international gambling and money-laundering syndicate that was run out of Trump Tower in New York. The ring, according to the FBI, was operating under the protection of the Russian mafia.**  \n  \nLooks like money laundering, quacks like money laundering...  \n  \n>In April 2013, a little more than two years before Trump rode the escalator to the ground floor of Trump Tower to kick off his presidential campaign, police burst into Unit 63A of the high-rise and rounded up 29 suspects in two gambling rings. **The operation, which prosecutors called \u201cthe world\u2019s largest sports book,\u201d was run out of condos in Trump Tower\u2014including the entire fifty-first floor of the building. In addition, unit 63A\u2014a condo directly below one owned by Trump\u2014served as the headquarters for a \u201csophisticated money-laundering scheme\u201d that moved an estimated $100 million out of the former Soviet Union, through shell companies in Cyprus, and into investments in the United States. The entire operation, prosecutors say, was working under the protection of Alimzhan Tokhtakhounov, whom the FBI identified as a top Russian vor closely allied with Semion Mogilevich. In a single two-month stretch, according to the federal indictment, the money launderers paid Tokhtakhounov $10 million**.\n\n>Tokhtakhounov, who had been indicted a decade earlier for conspiring to fix the ice-skating competition at the 2002 Winter Olympics, was the only suspect to elude arrest. For the next seven months, the Russian crime boss fell off the radar of Interpol, which had issued a red alert. **Then, in November 2013, he suddenly appeared live on international television\u2014sitting in the audience at the Miss Universe pageant in Moscow. Tokhtakhounov was in the VIP section, just a few seats away from the pageant owner, Donald Trump.**  \n  \nA major operation run a single floor underneath Donny's personal unit... Hmm...  \n  \n>After the pageant, **Trump bragged about all the powerful Russians who had turned out that night, just to see him. \u201cAlmost all of the oligarchs were in the room,\u201d he told Real Estate Weekly**. Contacted by Mother Jones, Tokhtakhounov insisted that he had bought his own ticket and was not a VIP. He also denied being a mobster, telling The New York Times that he had been indicted in the gambling ring because FBI agents \u201cmisinterpreted his Russian slang\u201d **on their Trump Tower wiretaps**, when he was merely placing $20,000 bets on soccer games.  \n  \nYep. Also, could those be the \"Obama/Comey wiretaps\" Trump tweeted about before?  \n  \n>But even if Trump has no memory of the many deals that he and his business made with Russian investors, he certainly did not \u201cstay away\u201d from Russia. For decades, he and his organization have aggressively promoted his business there, seeking to entice investors and buyers for some of his most high-profile developments. **Whether Trump knew it or not, Russian mobsters and corrupt oligarchs used his properties not only to launder vast sums of money from extortion, drugs, gambling, and racketeering, but even as a base of operations for their criminal activities. In the process, they propped up Trump\u2019s business and enabled him to reinvent his image. Without the Russian mafia, it is fair to say, Donald Trump would not be president of the United States.**  \n  \nI rest my case.",

But to a poor person in a swing state living paycheck to paycheck, the extra $50 a month or whatever that they're going to see in their paycheck is going to be a gamechanger.    \n\nThe average poor person, at least in my state, either doesn't have health insurance at all, or has their health insurance covered by their employer, some subsidy, or a combination of the two.  They're not very likely to see a significant increase in their health insurance costs.  Many of them either won't know about the effects of the tax plan on Obamacare, won't understand it, or won't care.  And part of the reason they won't care is directly because of the increase in their take-home pay.  \n\nMost of the pain that the poor will feel will come either after the 2018 or 2020 elections.  And by then, this group of GOP candidates won't care.  That's the whole point of how the plan is structured -- make it so by the time most people realize that they took it up the ass, it'll be too late to matter.  \n\nAnd at some point, the Democrats are going to have to campaign on a platform that will undo all of this.  And try telling a bunch of poor people in swing states that you're campaigning on a platform that is going to take back that $50 every month.    Try explaining to some swing state voters that a Democratic health care program is collapsing because of some provision buried deep in a complicated tax code released years earlier, and you'll be lucky to get a blank stare.  All they'll hear is that the GOP put extra money in their pocket, the Democratic health care program is collapsing, and the Democrats want to take that $50 bucks back.  Watch how quickly the GOP gets voted right back into power.\n\nAnd keep in mind....some of these swing states are *VERY* anti-abortion, and love the fact that the GOP is stacking the courts with conservative judges, giving them even more reason to vote GOP.\n\nThe GOP is winning.  Whether or not they're winning because of Trump or in spite of him is irrelevant.  They're winning.\n\n",

He got elected using the Southern Strategy, which introduced racist dog whistles into our politics and never allowed the country to heal from the Jim Crow era and the eras before that. \n\n2. Roger Ailes, founder of Fox News, working in the Nixon White House. The lessons he learned from his media strategy for Nixon led him to pursue the creation of Fox News. \n\n3. 6 month\u2019s after George Powell sent a memo to the US Chamber of Commerce saying that business must take an extremely influential role in American politics, Nixon hired him to be his Supreme Court justice. A few years later, Justice Powell presided over *First National Bank vs. Belotti*. This case ruled that corporations could fund elections because money = free speech, and Powell, Nixon\u2019s justice, wrote the majority opinion. Oh and FYI, his majority opinion was cited as case precedent in Citizens United. \n\n4. This Belotti case led, a few years later, to the implementation of supply side economics, aka trickle down economics. I don\u2019t have to even go into too much detail on how much this has hurt our economy and exploded income inequality. (If you look at inequality graphs, starting in 1978\u2013aka the year of the Belotti case\u2014is precisely when income inequality explodes. It\u2019s uncanny.)\n\n5. The racist drug war, which started out as treatment-based (and was effective!) but quickly turned to profiling, arrests, and imprisonment. This shift to punishment happened because his racist rhetoric, his southern strategy approach to associating black drug users with horrible filth, whipped the American people into a frenzy and they demanded it. \n\nThe worst part of all of this is that his administration led to Fox News which straight fucked us. Any changes we want to make to revert actions of the Nixon administration will not gain bipartisan support because Fox News and their similar stations will just lie to their audience. They can convince their viewers to literally vote against their best interests. They can convince their viewers that supply side economics will finally work for them \u2014 that America\u2019s problems in the past 40 years was because we didn\u2019t embrace trickle down economics ***enough***. \n\nFuck Nixon.

    "body": "Yes.\n\nMarty is the only person who isn\u2019t an alternate self by the end. Doc has been altered at least twice (first the Doc who put on a bulletproof vest and was changed in his personality by knowing Marty for a few days, the Doc who meets Marty again after the DeLorean gets zapped, and the Doc who is actually in the old west, Remember that the Doc who became a smith sent his instructions to Future Marty, but *that* Doc never had the experience of Marty showing up after he went back to the future in front of he clock tower, nor did he ever receive the instructions that he sent himself.\n\nThere\u2019s several Docs: Doc who invented the time machine, Doc who invented the time machine and met Marty and went to/from 2015 with him, Doc who exists in 2015 but never went there himself, Doc who went to the Old West, Doc who knew he went to the Old West but didn\u2019t, and Doc who was shot by Mad Dog Tannen.\n\nThere\u2019s also at least three Jennifers: One who went to the future, one who never went to the future, one who was left in Biff World, one who was on her own porch when Marty got back, and maybe more that I\u2019m missing.\n\nThere\u2019s also multiple versions of Marty, but we only ever meet one and the quirks of all the time travel events means we follow him and the others ones are only briefly seen or implied- there is probably a Marty who is actually in Europe in Biff World and there is a Marty who occupies a world where his dad is a successful author and he has no memory of any time travel. We don\u2019t meet that one, we follow one Marty through a universe that has a time loop in it.\n\nThe hitch in all this is that I. BTTF Pt 1 \u201cour\u201d Marty starts to cease to exist and it\u2019s never touched on again exactly how that works. Other things in BTTF change, like the match pack and tombstone photo, but they change into other things that make sense: a pack of matches from a gas station and a photo of an empty field. The last one is difficult to explain.\n\nThe strange way these objects behave probably has something to do with the oddity of their existence at all. Marty is the only person/thing that seems unaffected. The photo in his pocket changes, but his memories don\u2019t, which is odd. \n\nThe changing objects have one thing in common, though: 1955. Maybe Doc is right and there is a time nexus in that specific period and if things are disturbed a bunch of universes suddenly have zero probability of existing and just vanish.\n\nThe photos and match pack, like Marty, went through the time machine so they still exist, but the changes to their *own past* are now reflected in physical changes.\n\nTime travel in BTTF never makes any sense and just exists to serve the characters and adventure plot so it\u2019s best not to think about it too much.\n\nI don\u2019t know why I typed all this on my phone in /r/politics on Christmas Eve, but there it is.
