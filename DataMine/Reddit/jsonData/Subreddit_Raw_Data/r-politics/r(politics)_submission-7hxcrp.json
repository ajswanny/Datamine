As a result, many companies won\u2019t be able to use tax breaks that were supposed to be preserved in the legislation, including the extremely popular credit for research and development costs. Corporate accountants started freaking out about this over the weekend, but the situation reached high farce when a group of lawyers from Davis Polk pointed out that, by leaving the AMT intact, Republicans had essentially undermined their bill\u2019s most important changes to the international tax code.\n\nOops!!",

While job *benefits* go up (which includes wages, medical insurance, other insurance and perks), wages have been losing to increased out-of-pocket medical expenses and inflation for about 20 years. In 10 years I've had only 3 raises, and two of them were around 0.2%. That hardly keeps up with inflation, and medical premiums I have to pay which have increased 500% in my case in that time.\n\n\nI can't blame the younger generations for being pissed as they haven't even had a chance to get real experience at a job to make themselves more stable, job-wise, in their degreed area. \n",

This AMT blunder will blow a $300 billion hole in the calculations when it is removed. So other things are going to have to be shuffled around to meet the deficit and revenue requirements. If some of those things were the ~~bribes~~ parts that got a Senator to vote yes, then removing or changing them could change their vote for the reconciled bill.\n\nThis is why it is a bad idea to try and rush major tax legislation, unilaterally, using the reconciliation process.

Now they can get to 20% without the R&D credit because that's the new base tax rate (provided the bill actually passes - remember it isn't actually law yet). If a company can get a 20% tax rate without the R&D credit and at the same time can't take advantage of the the R&D credit, they might decide to fire all of the people that were basically being subsidized by the R&D credit as having them on will now cost more money than not.
