    "body": "From the [whitehouse.gov page on DT's \"energy plan\"] (https://www.whitehouse.gov/america-first-energy):  \n>Energy is an essential part of American life and a staple of the world economy. The Trump Administration is committed to energy policies that lower costs for hardworking Americans and maximize the use of American resources, freeing us from dependence on foreign oil.  \n  \nYou know what else would do that? Continuing progress on *clean energy* and working to make oil obsolete.  \n  \n>For too long, we\u2019ve been held back by burdensome regulations on our energy industry. President Trump is committed to eliminating harmful and unnecessary policies such as the Climate Action Plan and the Waters of the U.S. rule. Lifting these restrictions will greatly help American workers, increasing wages by more than $30 billion over the next 7 years.  \n  \nThose \"burdensome regulations\" are there to protect public health and save lives. Eliminating these \"harmful policies\" will cause unimaginable harm to our people and planet.  \n  \n>Sound energy policy begins with the recognition that we have vast untapped domestic energy reserves right here in America. The Trump Administration will embrace the shale oil and gas revolution to bring jobs and prosperity to millions of Americans. We must take advantage of the estimated $50 trillion in untapped shale, oil, and natural gas reserves, especially those on federal lands that the American people own. We will use the revenues from energy production to rebuild our roads, schools, bridges and public infrastructure. Less expensive energy will be a big boost to American agriculture, as well.  \n  \nYes, let's get busy fracking all over the place. Nevermind all those earthquakes!  \n  \n>The Trump Administration is also committed to clean coal technology, and to reviving America\u2019s coal industry, which has been hurting for too long.  \n  \nCOAL ISN'T COMING BACK THIS IS A LIE LIE LIE.\n  \n>In addition to being good for our economy, boosting domestic energy production is in America\u2019s national security interest. President Trump is committed to achieving energy independence from the OPEC cartel and any nations hostile to our interests. At the same time, we will work with our Gulf allies to develop a positive energy relationship as part of our anti-terrorism strategy.  \n  \nWe can boost domestic energy production AND move away from oil at the same time. In a few years China will be leading the clean energy revolution, making massive profits selling their technology around the globe, while we're sitting here in the old USofA, finding new and better ways to suck dead dinosaur juice out of the ground while more and more people are dying from cancer.  \n  \n>Lastly, our need for energy must go hand-in-hand with responsible stewardship of the environment. Protecting clean air and clean water, conserving our natural habitats, and preserving our natural reserves and resources will remain a high priority. President Trump will refocus the EPA on its essential mission of protecting our air and water.  \n  \nBWAHAHAHAHA OMG WTF all of THAT above talking about scrapping regulations which aim to improve our air and water quality and then THIS? **REFOCUS THE EPA???** FFS, how? By putting in charge a bought-and-paid-for shill for the fossil fuel industry? A man who only recently grudgingly stated that he kinda thinks climate change might be a thing maybe but he's not even sure if humans really have much to do with it. A man who as Oklahoma AG, has sued the EPA repeatedly over, among other things, laws requiring lower mercury emissions from power plants. Seriously?  \n  \n>A brighter future depends on energy policies that stimulate our economy, ensure our security, and protect our health. Under the Trump Administration\u2019s energy policies, that future can become a reality.  \n\nThese policies will do none of the above. Our economy will stagnate and fall behind as the rest of the world gets over its addiction to oil. Our security will suffer as climate change accelerates - our own military has said as much. And our health, fuck me... Destroying regulations which are intended to reduce pollution and hold accountable those who spew toxic waste into the water and air will have no positive effects on the health of Americans.  ",

The problem lies in the very concept of being renewable. Coal, gas, oil all of those are limited resources. Only so much is collected and only so much exists. You have much more power over controlling price when the supply is limited. In turn greater margins. Renewable energy lacks the ability to imply scarcity and thusly you cannot manipulate price as easily.\n\nThis will change. Eventually energy will be so abundant that it won't be a sector of extreme profit. Sadly American business people want to milk every dollar of dirty energy they can before it's exhausted. I just hope we see this changed before clean energy becomes so abundant, or America will come late to the party with an even worse environment and economy.",
