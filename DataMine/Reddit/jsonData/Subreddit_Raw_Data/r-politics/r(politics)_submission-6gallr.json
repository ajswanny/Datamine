He's gas-lighting the entire country.\n\n------------------------------------\n\nEdit:\n\n>Someone correctly pointed out that Trump said - he will let us know soon if there are tapes, and 'you all will be very disappointed,' IIRC. meaning that disappointment could come from no tapes existing at all...\n\nIf there were no \"tapes\" (real tapes or digital recordings), but Trump still tweeted that Comey better hope there are no \"tapes\", that goes into the territory of witness intimidation. That's a crime. I would hope that the White House Press Corps would bring that up to Sean Spicer or Sara Huckabee if they tried to play the spin game.\n\n------------------------------------\n\nEdit 2:\n\nJust to clear up why I think this is going into the territory of witness intimidation, I would point to [18 U.S. Code \u00a7 1512](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1512) and specifically part (b)(2)(A).\n\nTrump's tweet says: [James Comey better hope that there are no \"tapes\" of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press!](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/863007411132649473)\n\nThe intent is spelled out in the text of the tweet itself. He is explicitly cautioning/warning Comey *against* releasing the memos of the conversations.\n\nIf the tapes don't exist, then Trump \"engaged in misleading conduct toward another person\" (i.e.: James Comey) \"with intent to cause or induce any person\" (i.e.: again, James Comey) \"to withhold a record, document\" (i.e.: the memos) \"from an official proceeding\"(i.e.: Congressional hearings and investigations). I am directly quoting the matching parts of the statue here.\n\nThe \"misleading conduct\" part of the statue is critical. If the tapes exist, then the tweet was not misleading. It would be argued that Trump was simply confronting Comey with the truth, and that's not tampering. But it is the tapes not being real that causes this tweet to potentially flirt with illegality.",

Yeah, probably the more appropriate term is 'conservative' before Republican. But I voted for McCain, begrudgingly. I voted for Romney, excitedly. And I was a Rubio supporter before I ended up voting for Clinton. Conservatives didn't vote for her because we liked her politics. We voted for her to save the country from Trump and to kill his cancerous movement within our party.\n\n3. I'd rather act as a force of good in the party as it is now, and to shine a light on the hypocrisies of our party. If I 'become' a Democrat, it carries far less weight to try and change opinions of those around me.\n\nMost people knock on us for that, which is very insulting IMO. So I appreciate the honest approach in questioning. Many of the things I believe match up with what Democrats currently support, but I (in the minority, I know) think a lot of those things are based in conservative thinking. The greater we can grow the anti-Trump resistance within our party, the better chance we have at ridding ourselves of not just Trump, but the Trumpism that will likely continue should he be chased out of office.",

It seems to me every stance the GOP has is meant to bring us to back to a policy that has been proven to fail. They want to eliminate the banking regulations that helped get us into the finical crisis, they want to bring back a healthcare system where many more will once again be uninsured, and they want to try trickle down economics for the third time. I'm not saying the Democrats have it completely figured out by any means, but at least they aren't harping on ideas that have already failed time and time again. \n\nI guess my big question is, what GOP stances do you agree with?\n\n(for the record, I am wildly progressive if not for the sole reason that automation will devastate the economy if we don't make some drastic changes)",

I'd say I'm a democrat, but the right still has some good talking points (or at least I'd like to think the GOP's ideals have some merit to them). The way their party is run right now is terrible. \n\n\nI also hope their eventual rebirth does away with the religious right, because that nonsense also needs to go away. I'm a christian too, but that shouldn't have any say in what laws should be passed. Some of these Republicans still oppose gay marriage because the Bible told them to, and it's their only defense. This isn't a Theocracy. ",
