What the article should be asking is the threats of jihadist attacks and white supremacist attacks. Today jihadist attacks pose a much greater threat. Jihadists were able to kill roughly the same amount of a Americans in one day then the KKK has in its entire existence. What I am trying to get at is this article seems to brush off the threat of jihadist terrorism by hiding behind the fact that refugees in America don't commit them and cites the SPLC's list of hate crimes (that is unreliable at best) to prove white supremacist attacks are somehow more prevalent.",

America is the furthest western country from the middle-east with far stricter immigration controls than the countries of say...Europe. You know the region where a pop concert just got bombed. \n\nI feel like this is an effort to pretend like there is no risk to taking in refugees. Even the title of this post is an attempt at narrative crafting. For 30 of the 40 years terrorist attacks weren't happening at anywhere near the scale they are today. There's absolutely no reason to talk about any time period longer than maybe 15 years in regards to refugees other than to just try to make it sound more extreme. \n\nI think if we're going to talk about loosening those restrictions which has kept us relatively safe from such attacks (which was one goal of the candidate that lost) shouldn't we instead of crafting the narrative that terrorists aren't a threat maybe consider the ramifications? \n\nOr better yet, why don't we, as a country, just stop interfering in the middle east and stirring up wars and arming people and then we wouldn't even need to take in refugees who might harbor hatred against us.\n\nObviously, Trump hasn't stuck to this, but I think one of the main reasons Trump got the support he did is because he promised a very non-interventional approach to the middle-east.

    "body": "When I first joined the Navy, after training a few of us we were on our way to our first ship, which was on deployment in the Gulf at the time. We landed in Bahrain, and were there for 3 days waiting to get picked up and flown to the ship via helo. So we spent 3 days sight-seeing around Manama, Bahrain. Everyone there was so lovely and incredibly friendly, which was a real surprise to a few of the guys I was with. They had been nervous the whole time walking around, being white guys in the Middle East. Not sure what they expected to happen, but i guess if you spend enough time growing up being told simply that \"Muslims want to kill you because you're a white Christian\" it can make you a little nervous walking around a place like that. But the real shock was at the Grand Mosque. The Grand Mosque is an incredibly beautiful structure and we were outside taking a couple pictures, when a guy came out and asked if we'd like a tour. A couple of us were all for it, but the other guys were hesitant at first. Anyway, we go in, and the tour guide tells us a little about himself, shows us the building (which is even more beautiful on the inside) and points out things we might want a picture of. He also explains their religious beliefs to us, why they pray 5 times a day, the importance of washing hands/feet, the concept of their one-on-one relationship with God rather than talking to Him through a priest, etc. At the end as we're getting ready to leave he gives us each a copy of the Quran and says, \"I'm not trying to convert anyone, you have your faith and I have mine. All faith is a wonderful thing. But if even one of you takes a moment to read this, it is one step closer to our cultures better understanding each other, that we may all live in harmony someday.\"\n\nFrom that day forth we all had a lot more respect for Muslims and those that were nervous around Muslims going in, were a lot less so from then on. I was already a pretty progressive guy, and it was an eye-opener even for me.",

All you have to do is look at the facts, what evidence is there of a rigged election and 3 million illegal votes?

If a citizen cannot think critically, they are actually mentally incapable of questioning reports, examining motivations, making inferences, or formulating a 'devils advocate' theory of the point of view of the other side. On *anything.* They can't do it about religion, politics, policy, nothing. And they desperately psychologically *need* someone to tell them what point of view to take. Or they are unmoored. \n\nI was horrified. I still am. But the studies we were reading bore it out. It's a failure of home, school, society, everything. It is a systemic mutual failure. \n\nInability to engage in critical thinking, and the refusal to recognize this as the mental disability it is (one that can be taught and overcome), is at the center of the failing of our society. \n\nIf you take away, or fail to develop, the citizenry's ability to actually think, well, you can do whatever you want, because they will believe anything.",

There's also Lee Jordan, who has dreads, he's pretty obviously meant to be black.
