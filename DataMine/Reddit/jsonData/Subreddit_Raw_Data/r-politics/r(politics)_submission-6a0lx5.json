Maybe because he associated here with Obama and he just hates anyone associated with Obama.\n\n* POTUS isn't \"in on it\", but genuinely doesn't care that the NatSec Advisor is compromised.

It's pure speculation, but currently every time the GOP accuses Democrats of doing something, it's really just projection and it is all on the GOP. This leads me to think that the GOP has some very sensitive things that they do not want to be let out. Russia may or may not have these things. It's either a spoken or unspoken message from Russia to the GOP that they have this information. \n\nThe GOP is basically trying not to \"wake the giant\" by being careful. They are trying their best to tiptoe around these Russian hearings. They are trying to edge around the lava pit of this deception. I think they think they can get out of it. I don't think that every GOP member has a hand in it, but I believe there's a good amount that do. \n\nI don't think they realize it yet, but they're not going to be able to get out of this. The moment they \"escape\", Russia will release that information. The GOP's best option is to come clean now, and get this shit over with, than to drag it out like they have been. It makes the situation even worse. ",

    "body": "**And** Pence.  \n  \nTrump *and* Pence knew that Flynn was compromised, Trump *and* Pence looked the other way, Trump *and* Pence put our national security at risk, Trump *and* Pence are responsible.  \n  \nThe entire administration is complicit in this, none of them get the benefit of the doubt: It's not one apple that's bad, *the entire tree is sick.*  Donald Trump is responsible, Mike Pence is responsible, Jeff Sessions is responsible, and every Republican Congressman and Senator who insists on derailing the questions, distracting the public, and defending the perpetrators is responsible.  \n\nSally Yates told Donald Trump the truth and was fired for it.  \nElijah Cummings told Mike Pence the truth and was ignored.  \nPresident Obama warned the administration and he was blamed.  \n  \nThe next time someone tells you that the two parties are the same, or that one candidate is just the lesser of two evils, remind them of today's absurdity.  \n  \nEdit: Apparently the Trump supporter's argument is \"If Flynn is so bad then why did the Obama administration give him clearance!?\"  So here's a couple things:  \n  \n 1. It's not President Obama's responsibility to vet *President Trump's appointments,* that's *President Trump's responsibility.*  Donald Trump is trying to pass the buck just like the failed Yemen attack that Trump tried to blame on Obama, the Syrian chemical weapon attack that Trump tried to blame on Obama, the Muslim ban that Trump tried to blame on Obama, the frequent Trump administration leaks that Trump tried to blame on Obama, and the imaginary wiretap of Trump Tower that Trump tried to blame on Obama.  Donald Trump was responsible for the Yemen raid, Assad was responsible for the chemical weapon strike, Trump was responsible for the Muslim ban, Trump is responsible for his administration leaking like a sieve, and Trump is responsible for lying about being spied on.  \n  \n 2. [President Obama actually *did warn* President Trump about not hiring Flynn as National Security Advisor, a warning which President Trump *chose to ignore.*](http://www.cnn.com/2017/05/08/politics/obama-trump-michael-flynn/)  \n  \n 3. There is a [significant difference between security clearance being granted to *a retired General no longer in the employ of the United States Army or Federal Government,* and security clearance being granted *to the National Security Advisor.*](http://www.businessinsider.com/susan-rice-trump-obama-michael-flynn-vetting-2017-4)  \n  \n 4. President Obama personally warned Trump about Flynn, Sally Yates warned Trump about Flynn, Elijah Cummings warned *Pence* about Flynn, and yet Donald Trump ***chose*** to ignore each and every one of those warnings and kept Flynn on as National Security Advisor.  It wasn't until Flynn was publicly outed in the news that Trump finally decided to ask Flynn for his resignation... more than two weeks after Trump was warned by Yates.  \n  \nI'm sorry Trump supporters, there comes a point at which your man *has to accept personal responsibility for his actions.*  Trump *chose* to appoint Flynn, Trump *chose* to ignore the warnings, Trump *chose* to let Flynn keep his job, Trump *chose* to try to silence Yates, Trump *chose* to try to quash the news about Russia, Trump *chose* to distract from the discussion, and only after it was obvious that he had no other choices left did he fire Flynn.  \n  \nYou voted for this man, now hold him responsible, because it's obvious that he'll never accept responsibility for himself.",

There may **or may not** be evidence of collusion that is not yet public.\n\n[Here's a link to the transcript](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2017/05/08/full-transcript-sally-yates-and-james-clapper-testify-on-russian-election-interference/?utm_term=.960663e36740)\n\nAnd here's what he actually said.  \n\nSen Graham asked if his statements on meet the press were still accurate, he said yes.  Here are his statements from meet the press: \"We did not include any evidence in our report. And I say our, that's the NSA, the FBI, the CIA, with my office, the Director of National Intelligence, that had anything \u2014 that had any reflection of collusion between members of the Trump campaign and the Russians. There was no evidence of that included in our report.\"\n\nGraham: Chuck Todd (ph) then asked, \"I understand that, but does it exist?\" You say no, not to my knowledge. Is that still accurate?\n\nClapper: Yes, it is.\n\nHe hasn't been DNI since November and he goes on to say that even if there was evidence, it wasn't an investigation being conducted by the DNI; collusion was an FBI task (domestic/counterintel) and he would not be made aware of that.  Yates chimed in to say the same.  \n\nYATES: Well, I think that Director Clapper also said that he was unaware of the FBI counter intelligence investigations.\n\n[Meet the Press Transcript from Mar 4th if you're interested](http://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/meet-press-03-05-17-n729271)\n\nEdit: Here's an excellent quote to sum up why anything Clapper says about evidence of collusion means basically nothing to whether or not there is evidence of such collusion.  It's in his opening remarks from the first link.\n\nClapper: And as a consequence, I was not aware of the counterintelligence investigation Director Comey first referred to during his testimony before the House Permanent Select Committee for Intelligence on the 20th of March, and that comports with my public statements.\n",

I have zero doubt that she'd be a million times better than Trump and have a good understanding of constitutional law and other issues, but it's certainly not just about knowing the law.\n\nWarren understands the behind-the-scenes nature of Congress and getting commonsense reforms enacted (Dodd-Frank, CFPB, etc.).

Here in Texas I needed:\n\nValid prev. state driver license\n\nValid passport \n\nUtility bill matching lease\n\nState provided forms (2-3)\n\nLease\n\nMy brother, because he was the main signer on the lease \n\n\nEdit: I'm not saying this is the experience every person goes through, however I'm a fully legal resident who had all legal/valid paperwork from 2 states away. Moving in with my brother and signing on his lease very well could have caused an extra step in my process, however the point is this shouldn't be this hard. \n\nEdit #2: To be clear, these steps were required to obtain an ID, not register to vote itself. You however need a Texas state ID of some form in order to register to vote, which must again be done a full 30 days before an election you plan to participate it (if you just moved here and plan to vote, too bad). After registering to vote, it has been fairly easy. I can see why some people however would decline to pursue registering after going through the throbs of getting an ID. This is all in comparison to my experience in AZ, where there was almost zero effort, comparatively. ",

They didn't have shareholders they were beholden to at the level there is now. Big companies worked to a profit, but not a killing. You can't do that shit year after year because you cut payroll too much, you kill the economy and nobody has money to buy your shit anymore. They invested in their work force..
