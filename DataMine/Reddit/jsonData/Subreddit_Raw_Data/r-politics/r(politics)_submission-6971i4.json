Quite frankly, I'm not sure how anyone outside of the financially well off in America are having children. My wife was out on extended bed rest at three months into the pregnancy. Insurance covered her salary until she gave birth. We then get 12 months paid maternity/paternity leave paid for by the government. Also, she had to have a C-section as well as a cerclage put in at three months. No hospital bills. Mat leave is not full salary, but at least it's something. ",

Their fundamental position requires that they support this, because anything else would involve raising taxes slightly.

I'm younger than you, and not from a particularly religious area, but knew/know *far* too many girls who went though very similar things. \n\nIt doesn't stop after high school either. In both my personal life, and a as a Planned Parenthood volunteer, I've witnesses a shocking number of women forced to drop out of college (by their parents, husbands, even schools) in order to have children and become full-time caregivers. I have friends who attended mainstream Christian colleges while volunteering with local social workers and health clinics. They have horror stories about how difficult it can be for many women get access to reproductive healthcare and contraceptives. It is shockingly common for girls to get caught trying to get an abortion (another student informed on them, they were guilted into confessing, or they were under the age of 18 in certain states) and get punished by their universities. The girl's parents are typically informed, and she's swiftly pulled out of school, her scholarships get revoked, or, at more devout schools with \"morality codes\", she gets kicked-out entirely. \n\nA lack of sex education and an inability to access birth control (both logistically and financially) are, of course, the biggest risk factors for these situations. However, rape is the disturbingly common cause of these pregnancies, as well as STIs, physical injuries, and other health consequences. Young women/girls often believe that they brought the attacks upon themselves, and are in too much shock, denial, or fear to get help when they need it. They're typically too ashamed to ask for assistance from those around them, and, sadly, their reluctance is not unwarranted. Those who do speak out, or \"confess\", are often pressured into keeping quiet by their peers, schools, and families. Usually, they are accused of lying, trying to damage the school's reputation, ruining a man's life/hurting his family, or presenting themselves immodestly. \n\nThe most absurd trend that professionals, other volunteers, and I regularly see is how normalized these situations are. After the initial stages of shock, panic, and devastation, young women learn to accept their new lives astoundingly quickly and calmly. Most feel that it's all they can do. Besides, they have all seen this play out before, often in their own families. Those women are all happy, right? They've spent their entire lives hearing about how women were designed to raise children, care for their husbands, and take build homes for them. The order of things may not be ideal, but this is what they are meant to do. What kind of horrible, unloving, undesirable woman doesn't want that? A woman who doesn't want a child must have something wrong with them, they are broken, unwomenly, and certainly not wife material. Nobody wants to be that. ",
