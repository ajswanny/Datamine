Either way he will go eventually, but we will still have many of these same useless Senators and much worse all the radial idiots in the House.. They are the people causing the most harm to this country. They need to go..\n\nI'm not against having Republicans in congress, at least 2 viable parties are required for a solid democracy but we need to get rid of the crazed idiots and end the notation they seem to hold dearest which is party before country.

Yea, that's clearly not the case. Comey wants to talk, and not just that, he wants the AMERICAN PEOPLE to hear him. This is a man who I'm sure has quite a bit to say, at least related to the circumstances around his firing and his fateful last few meetings with Trump. Comey might be the most interesting figure in FBI lore since J. Edgar Hoover, which is just stunning. I have no doubts in my mind at this point that Comey is a true patriot and his primary concern is the well-being of this country and its people.\n\n[As Bart Scott famously said...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBaYVo89mmY)",

You really think that, after ONE conversation with Comey let alone three, his thumbs wouldn't be overworked from so much tweeting after allegedly being told he wasn't under investigation? We're supposed to accept and rely on this guy that he was told MONTHS ago he was in the clear and we're just now hearing it? Ba-fucking-loney. Trump would be shouting and tweeting it from the fucking White House rooftop the second he left dinner with Comey after being told he wasn't under investigation.

It us the term \"chef spiritual\" and therefore must be related to cannabalistic spirit cooking. Except \"chef spiritual\" translates to \"religious leader\" in French, which must have been surprising given that Macron speaks French. /s\n\nThere was also this thread (recently deleted) trying to connect someone to PizzaGate based on a single Instagram photo. Although the people looked somewhat similar, it was the wrong person in the photo.\n\nhttps://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6alqzi/pg/\n\nOnce this inconvenient fact was pointed out, /u/globalism_sux made this absurd claim:\n\n> I mean the pervert in the left photo has his arm around a guy wearing an \"I love children\" shirt. Yeah, downvote me or whatever you feel like, but I think that's pretty convincing circumstantial evidence.\n\nExcept the shirt actually read: \"I \u2665 L'ENFANT\" which is both a cafe and a location is Washington, D.C.\n\nHe was rightfully mocked for being geographically ignorant, but I guess it is difficult to know about the bigger, outside world when you are too busy to leave your mother's basement:\n\n* L'enfant is an actual place in DC though. It even has it's own stop on the DC metro. L'enfant plaza. I don't buy that whole thing about the I love children shirt.\n\n* The guy wearing it is actually the owner of L'enfant Cafe. You can actually spot him in one of the pictures on their site wearing an \"I <3 NY\" shirt.\n\n* NY is short for \"nubile youth.\" I read it on 4chan, so it must be true.\n\n* Plus that picture was taken at a cafe called \"L'Enfant\" and in French, if you were to translate it directly (not as a surname/proper noun), it is singular not plural so it doesn't make sense.\n\n* It could also be translated to \"I love child\", like \"j'aime le boeuf\" which translates to \"I love beef\".\n\n**TL;DR: American conspiracy theorists should learn some French.**",

It is not about \"they're all dumb for voting for the GOP\" its about how most of the voters in KY are old boomers who are very right wing and religious because the South. Young people and more moderate people in KY dont vote due to apathy and lack of faith in the system. They have the mentality of \"if Mitch McConnell is going to keep winning after 30+ years, why should I even bother voting\", which ends up being a self-fulfilling prophecy.",

The suffering there is real.  The coal mines have left my family with a 40% cancer rate.  I have no love for the coal industry, but I understand their support because nobody else is coming to help them.  Mitch brings federal money in and props up the only industry that hires them.\n\nThe truth of it is most of the country (like yourself) sneer at eastern KY and turn your nose up and call the residents hillbillies.  Pike Co. KY has over 60k residents and doesn't even have a Starbucks.  I have seen Bentleys in Pike Co., yet no industry will go there because of prejudices against the residents.\n\nBobby Kennedy went to Appalachia to expose the dire poverty of America.  For the next 50 years, progressives have been fine with ignoring it and letting the GOP embed itself.  I would suggest that reaching out and learning the real plight of the residents of eastern KY may do more good than calling them names.",
