    "body": "I am a lawyer. A motion in limine is a basic legal proceeding that occurs in every case that gets close to trial. Daubert is a little more advanced, but just explains rules of evidence 701, 702, and maybe 703 without re-reading that decision. Daubert relates to experts and when their opinions can be presented to the jury. The two abstention doctrines I don't know off hand, but I presume it deals with jurisdiction of federal courts vs. state courts. \n\nI am a lawyer, I did not Google any part of my above answer, but wanted to be honest about what a lawyer should know without doing research. At a minimum he should have some knowledge of a motion in limine and the Daubert questions.  He should have known the answers to the abstention questions through Senate hearing preparation. \n\nInasmuch an analogy would help. If this were baseball, a motion in limine would be similar to \"what is a grand slam?\"  Daubert would be similar to the infield fly rule. Abstention question would be similar to whether there is a designated hitter in the world series when the game is played in an American league park....and this guy is being nominated to be the umpire your next major league baseball game.",

That's not an exaggeration. And no law student in that position would ever consider taking such a position because they would know they aren't qualified. And that's what's so bad about this bastard.

    "body": "In California, the rules of our profession explicitly require that judges carry out their duties with competence. (See, Code of Conduct for United States Judges, Canon 3; California Rules of Professional Conduct 1.1) At this level of gross incompetence it seems to me that if this nominee accepts the appointment, he should immediately be subject to discipline and disbarment. \n\nObviously, this nominee probably doesn't know that, which is one more reason he should immediately be subject to discipline.\n\nEdit: \nFor those of you that are arguing that the professional rules allow you to become competent with diligent study, bullshit. If the only area of knowledge he needed to pick up where motions in limine, then maybe. Even then, motions in limine are just a type of motion that occurs away from the jury to avoid the jury being prejudiced by inadmissible evidence. There is a broad spectrum of types of motion in limine, each of which has its own case law and authority dictating its outcome. Maybe after a month or so of part time study, before his first trial, he might be able to become competent in the statutes, rules, and case law controlling common types of motions in limine. But if it's just indicative of his general knowledge of civil procedure, evidence code, and constitutional law at trial, then he would need four to five years of full-time study and trial practice to become competent for his first trial. \n\nAnd this is something you can't just read up on as you go. Imagine reading a story aloud to someone and they have to stop at every sentence to look up at least one word in the dictionary.  And then they have to look up two or three words from the definition given and at least one word from those definitions.\n\nKnowledge of the rules is only one piece too, conducting a trial as an attorney is an art form that takes an entire career to perfect. I know a lawyer who had over a decade of experience in civil law that quit their day job to become full-time pro bono traffic trial commissioners for a year or more, just to get the Judicial Council's blessing to be a competent trial judge.",

You can't summarily impeach all of these judges just because they were appointed by Trump, but it may be possible to enforce a rule that appointees *must* be pre-approved by the ABA to even be considered, and that those that were not have forfeited their judgeship. \n\nThere are other ways, but it's early in the morning and I'm pre-coffee brain.

Bryan Garner is a big advocate of this, and he has lots of judges (including the one I interned for) that agree that readability and comprehension is more important than sounding smart. I put citations in footnotes rather than in-line, for example, to make things easier to read by the lawyers and the public.\n\nI try to write for clarity. Sometimes that requires the use of a legal \"term of art\" -- i.e. a word that has a specific meaning in a legal context. But mostly, I try to write concisely and clearly and that usually means simply.\n\nHonestly, the biggest barrier to this isn't other lawyers or judges. It's clients. They actually get really mad when you write them a contract that they read and then say, \"well, I could have written this! What did I hire you for?\" They don't understand all the distillation and work that went into it, or the word choices I made (which come from cases, or statutes, or whatever). Contract drafting is an art that requires knowing what to include (and what to leave out). They think that just because they can understand it, they could have written it. That's dangerous as hell and leads to people legalzooming (or writing their own stuff, worse). I've met lawyers that retain legalese in their writing for this reason.\n\nTL/DR: There is some effort to eliminate the wordiness and legal jargon from writing but it's the clients that are the biggest resistance to this, not the attorneys.",
