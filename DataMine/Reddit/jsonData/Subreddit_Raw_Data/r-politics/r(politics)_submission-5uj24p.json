So, they can't make it so why make it a holiday.\n\nPeople have correctly pointed out that having a state wide holiday is great, but unnecessary as people can 'write-in' in California. But here is the the thing. California passing a statewide holiday helps pull the other states towards stronger voting practices. \n\nTake the lovely state of Missouri. We have no early voting or absentee  is very limited to military, being physically disabled, or religion. If someone suggested a statewide holiday to vote, that would be rejected outright, but it might push people to have better options to vote earlier or by mail.

Here in Dallas I can vote at any time 2-3 weeks before the election. If I can't make time to go vote that's on me. If every state doesn't have early voting then they should.\n\nBut you want to increase voter turnout? \n\nYou need mobile polling stations. \n\nYou need streamlined process for getting people in and out. The biggest slowdown I saw at polling stations were people who weren't registered or registered some where else or didn't have ID. Instead of waiting for those people to get to the check in, have someone going down the line checking for those people, and moving them into their own special line and the people who are prepared and ready get in their own line.\n\nPartner with Uber and Lyft. If you're going to a polling station it's a free ride. If you're leaving a polling station. Again free ride.\n\nLastly we do a lot to encourage voting, but it doesn't seem to either reach people or resonate with people. So many people think their vote doesn't count. It's time to make those votes count. We need to do nationally what Maine and Nebraska do. Split EC votes based on proportions of votes. This would even make Third party candidates viable. ",

Yes these are local elections about council, school board, sewer bonds etc. But these, arguably, have a greater direct impact on person's life than national elections.\n\nIt's almost like if you had read the article or clicked through to the bill you wouldn't have to ask this question...\n\nBut to your point, early voting and mail-in ballots would still be a thing. Like with every other holiday, people still sell gas and Taco Bell and Beer and drive buses and all that stuff because we all live different lives and have different schedules and priorities and beliefs. \n\n>So how long until it becomes just another day off? With big shopping sales and vacations. Hey take Monday off and make it a four day weekend.\n\nSure, some people probably would. If you're concerned with this, study it and determine if more people would 'slack' on that day and if it would *reduce* turnout because of it and make that case. Don't just argue the hypothetical because even if some people did treat it as 'just another day off', if the net amount of voters increases, it is still a positive overall. ",

Voting is important and it is too easy to vote multiple times or vote as someone else. So there needs to be a change to how people check in to vote. Also, there should be a real clear flowchart of permissions, rights, etc at each voting station.\n\n3.) Exit polls should be legal to gather but highly illegal to publish until after all stations have closed.\n\n4.) For nation-wide issues (such as the Presidential election), no counts should be released until all stations across the nation have closed AND all votes have been double counted.\n\nI'd love to see a few more things, such as something along the lines of block-chain / distributed ledger of votes. Each voter would receive a receipt that the can be used to verify the integrity of whether the vote was counted properly. All voting systems should be open-source and run on minimal hardware requirements (Australia has an awesome system). And I'm not opposed to mandatory attendance to a station (you don't have to vote, but you do have to show up).",

It's even made in such a way that the envelope can be opened  to take out the voting voucher without being able to access the voting paper. And as such ensuring the anonymity of the voter as the voting office first collects all voting vouchers and only then proceeds to count the actual voting paper.\n\nIf you want to vote personally you take your voting voucher to the nearest voting station (open saturday and sunday) and vote there. With one voucher per eligible voter there isn't any problem with double voting or illegal voting.\n\nIt's seriously isn't hard to come up with a safe and secure voting methode which ensures easy voting for everyone. So easy in fact that I can't help but be cynical about the reason why it hasn't done already.",

Of course, the method by which a government overrules its people has to be thorough and as uncorruptable as possible, but my point is that the majority can be wrong- they can be wrong in such a spectacular fashion that someone has to step in and prevent them from committing certain acts.

Making election day a holiday is a stupid idea for the exact reason /u/teeshirtandshortsguy brought up. People who get most federal and state holidays off of work almost always either work for the government, or are white-collar professionals. Where do these people go on their extra day off? Many travel, especially when there is a three day weekend. Some go shopping or to the movies, or out to lunch, or get their car fixed, or maybe to a special event at an arena or other event space. People who work in hospitality, in retail, at movie theaters, in food service, in trades, and at entertainment venues rarely get holidays off -- in fact, it's usually their busier days, which means they are even *more* likely to have to work on some holidays. People working low wage and part time jobs are those who have a hard time voting, making it a holiday doesn't help them in the least. This is bad policy that nobody wants to think through because a lot of ideas sound nice when they are explained in 10 words or less.",
