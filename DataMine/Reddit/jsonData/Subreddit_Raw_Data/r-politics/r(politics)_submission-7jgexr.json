If the Dems had fielded a nobody, or left the seat uncontested (as they did in 2014), Roy Moore would be Senator-elect right now. By running a former U.S. Attorney with a distinguished legal career, the Democrats ensured that they were able to put up a credible challenge in what unexpectedly became a highly competitive election. The outcome of this race will hopefully help recruiting for 2018 by convincing competent and credible candidates to run for the Democrats in heavily Republican seats, something that was already happening even before Jones' victory.",

In a normal, standard, non-polarizing polls \"generic republican\" beat \"generic democrat\" by about 28 points.\n\nJones win is somewhere in the neighborhood of 2 points.  Which means that various circumstances shifted by about 30 points.  538 did a good writeup on how there's basically 3 factors, each worth about 10 points.\n\nFirst is the fact that the republican party is lead by a historically unpopular president.  Seriously.  Trump is about 20 points underwater popularity wise nationally, and exit polls in Alabama of all places showed his popularity/unpopularity ratings amongst voters basically tied.  This is *historically* low.  He is far and away the lowest supported president in his first year in office, and recent approval ratings of 32% show him only about 6 points higher than *Nixon* was just before resigning.\n\nThe president's astoundingly low popularity can not be discounted, and the effect his presence in the White house, and the desire to thwart his agenda, and vote in opposition, is worth about 10 points.\n\nAnother 10 points is Moore's particular policy standings.  Not talking about the scandal here, I'm talking about things that were publicly known about Moore.  His statements about slavery.  His support for criminalizing homosexuality.  His actions that lead to his removal from public office, twice.  \n\nAnd finally, the scandal itself.  Polls taking just before it broke and just after saw Moore's standing in the polls erode by another 10 points.\n\nThis is what it took for a democrat to barely win in alabama.  A racist, oath breaking child molester being endorsed by a historically unpopular president.",

It\u2019s the first time someone\u2019s disgusting actions and unwavering stupidity actually cost an election. It\u2019s the first time something actually mattered in a tangible way. And it happened in ALABAMA of all places. If it can happen in Alabama, it can happen everywhere. This is a referendum on Trump, on Moore being a piece of shit, and on Bannon.
