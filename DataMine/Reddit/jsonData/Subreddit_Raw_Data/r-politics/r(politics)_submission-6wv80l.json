    "body": "Mattis is in theory unfirable. \n\nDoesn't mean that Donald wont fire him, but you should never have the person seemingly most respected by a majority of your serving military, as your first pick for Defense Secretary.\n\nIf you find that politically you need to fire them, not only do you damage the allegiance of your military, but also simultaneously releave of duty someone they might follow.\n\n---\n\nedit - folk should have a read of the interview he randomly gave to a high school newspaper on Mercer Island on Lake Washington, after they had the guts to ring him when his number leaked:\n\nhttp://mihsislander.org/2017/06/full-transcript-james-mattis-interview/\n\n>I would just tell you that there\u2019s all sorts of people that are going to give you advice and you should listen to the people you respect, but I think if you guide yourself by putting others first, by trying to serve others, whether it be in your family, in your school, in your church or synagogue or mosque or wherever you get your spiritual strength from, you can help your state, you can help your country, if you can help the larger community in the world, you won\u2019t be lying on a psychiatrist\u2019s couch when you\u2019re 45-years-old wondering what you did with your life.\n\n>Go out of your way. Not everyone has to join the military, it\u2019s not for everyone. For one thing it\u2019s scary as all get out at times, but whether it be the Peace Corp or the Marine Corps, whether it be serving on your local school board when you\u2019re still not even 30-years-old, by running for office and trying to get a good education for the kids in your community, just try to put others first and it will pay back in so many ways that you\u2019d be a lot happier in life. So just look for ways to help others all the way along, Teddy, and you\u2019ll never go far wrong if you\u2019re always looking to do that. You won\u2019t get all caught up in your own problems if you\u2019re out helping others overcome theirs.\n\n>And you keep asking these kind of questions Teddy. You\u2019re asking good, very good questions and just try to keep an open mind. There\u2019ll be a lot of people who want to tell you what to think in this world. If you read a lot of history you\u2019ll thank them for their help but you won\u2019t be governed by what someone else has told you to think.",

Buckley, to his credit, later acknowledged his error.\n\nThe fundamental impulse of the liberal mind is to improve what's bad, and the fundamental impulse of the conservative mind is to protect what's good.  Just as liberals must, in my mind, reckon with the steep toll in human misery of their failed attempts to perfect human society, so too must conservatives reckon with the needlessly prolonged injustices that have resulted from our refusal to rock the social boat.",

And we'd continue our slide into Nazi America.\n\nThis facist leadership is causing people who practice anything other than closeted prejudice and racism to offer themselves as targets for replacement. That's a disturbing trend. A catch-22 if I ever saw one. All these checks and balances are being obliterated.\n\nIf Mattis was telling his soldiers to \"hold the line\" I can't even imagine what was going on his mind about his own role that caused him to be in that mindset. I wonder if he's telling himself to hold the line, and this transgender thing and America are on his side, at the opposite of Trump and his fasict supporters.",

One is the power of intimidation. I was part of it and America will defend herself and our idea, this experiment that we call America. And that's all it is, is an experiment in democracy. But the other power I think that perhaps we have used less in recent years, last 20 years maybe, is the power of inspiration. And I think that the power of inspiration of America at times has got to be employed just as strongly.\"\n\nThat being said, if it fails he wants the US military to be the very best. The best, in the case of a military, is defined as the most lethal. Illustrated by this quote:\n\n\"My belief is that we have to stay focused on the military that is so lethal that on the battlefield, it is the enemy's longest day and worst day when they run into that force.\"\n\nI think Mattis wants to be remembered as someone who values peace but is not blind to the brutal realities of inevitable international conflicts.",

I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro's great stumbling block in his stride toward freedom is not the White Citizen's Counciler or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white moderate, who is more devoted to \"order\" than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice; who constantly says: \"I agree with you in the goal you seek, but I cannot agree with your methods of direct action\"; who paternalistically believes he can set the timetable for another man's freedom; who lives by a mythical concept of time and who constantly advises the Negro to wait for a \"more convenient season.\" Shallow understanding from people of good will is more frustrating than absolute misunderstanding from people of ill will. Lukewarm acceptance is much more bewildering than outright rejection.\n\nA sentiment which most white people even now would still distance themselves from and fall back on his \"I Have A Dream\" speech, which is more comfortable and does not require much self-reflection.\n\nI can't actually know if he really does understand that MLK was saying being a white moderate is worse than being a klansman... I guess, unless I ask. But it is surprising to learn nonetheless.\n\nEDIT: When I say worse, I don't mean they are actively killing people or something like that. It's that white moderates make up most of the population whereas the most extreme white supremacists make a much smaller percentage. Ultimately, white moderates hold our civil rights in their hands and they are more *\"devoted to \"order\" than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice\"*. Ultimately they are the ones standing in the way of racial equality because what it takes to change it makes them uncomfortable.",

    "body": "There's  a pile of replies to your comment (and well-deserved gold, I think), but I do want pop in a bit of disagreement to the characterization of conservative vs. liberal.  The conservative impulse isn't to preserve what's good, it's to preserve the status quo.  And the radical (a term I think more appropriate) impulse is to change it.  And they both implicitly accept the negative consequences as a necessary evil.\n\nAs much as semantic arguments aren't all that helpful, I think it's meaningful here, because I don't think you can lay at the feet of liberals the vast panoply of failed social experiments of the ~20th century, many of which are in direct opposition to each other.  Yes, they are all answers to \"what do we do without a king\" (with monarchy being the at-that-time conservative default), but beyond that, there's not a whole lot of common ground.\n\nI'm not a perfect student of history, but I'm not sure there are any examples of a liberal reform movement, motivated by broad Enlightenment principles (reason, personal freedom, egalitarianism, governance by social contract, pluralism, and compromise) that bears any of the sins of something like Marxism-Leninism.  Those liberal values were fairly radical in their day (and in some circles and some ways remain radical), but when you account for the natural tensions, it's a fundamentally moderating force that checks against various forms of totalitarianism.\n\nThe Civil Rights (and Women's Rights and Gay Rights) debates haven't been about whether conservatives think people should be allowed to vote or not.  Or allowed to get married.  They were debates about whether *some people* should be allowed to.  It's about whether to extend the broad umbrella of Liberalism to everyone, or to keep it exclusive to people who already have it.  And the status quo or \"preserving the [potential] good\" that you're suggesting conservatives valued was and is only about preserving the privileged position of those who inherited it.\n\nYou seem like a reasonable person, and probably a nice one, but in this context, there's no equivalence.  There's no shared blame.  The radicals who wanted the share the liberal dream with everyone were right, and the conservatives who wanted to hoard access to those liberal rights were wrong.  Liberalism is a worldview, not an impulse, and the excesses of it are (in my mind) self-correcting.  The cure for a struggling democracy is more democracy.  The cure for unequal justice is more equality and more justice.",

As surely as the embrace of authoritarianism can and has come from a liberal desire to impose \"perfect human society\", conservatives have also cleaved to the false promise of authoritarianism to achieve their goals to just as devastating an effect. \n\nWe should all remember, be we \"conservative\" or \"liberal\", that our common political heritage resides in classical liberalism, with it's core value for the freedom of individuals.

He always calls us an Experiment in Democracy, and he's right; we're historically barely a blip.\n\nI would say that MLK understood the threat of other countires, but his absolute priority was the inequalities being perpetuated by white complacency and hate groups.\n\nMattis sees our strategic position and knows how relatively fast a nation of our size and power can fall (compared to other large empires throughout history) if the military loses direction, discipline, and leadership. If military leaders start resigning and worse leaders take over it's going to hurt our nation.\n\nIf outright bigoted leaders (like our newly pardoned sheriff) take command we will have a mass exodus from the military (especially if that is the precedent set by higher ups) and this creates a huge problem.\n\nA lesson just like we learned when the Bush administration disbanded the Iraq military:\nWarriors and fighters don't stop fighting, they just find new people and ideas to fight for.\n\nLeaving top level military leadership in an attempt to show commitment to another cause (even a grand one) would fracture the military all the way down the chain of command and the lessons of history from similar historical events are written in the blood. \n\nMLK might have marked Mattis as part of the problem, but I would disagree with the Reverend if he did.",
