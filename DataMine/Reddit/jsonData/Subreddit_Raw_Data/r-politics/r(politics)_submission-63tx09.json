Sean Hannity and Rush Limbaugh aren't on the radio mentioning how much Trump (and his family) is costing the American taxpayers to go golfing all the time.\n\nI grew up and stopped caring about 'how much' it cost under Obama.

They moved to the city and transformed into something else.  You need an education to get them, now.  The city is where the democrats are strong.  So the republicans took the more rural areas, and claim the *democrats* took the jobs.  Took the right out of the coal mine, out of the factory, and pulled them into the city, where *they* live.  \n\nJobs that now need an *ivory tower* education to get, that honest *real* Americans like your dad can't just work hard and get anymore.  \n\nAnd you know what you can't admit to them?  Those those jobs just flat aren't coming back.  They didn't go somewhere else (like china), they were *automated.*  With the exception of a couple of years worth of spikes, America produces more coal now than any other time in history, but employs about half as many people as it did in 1990.  Manufacturing is the same way -- the total manufacturing output is the same as it ever was, it's just done with a fraction of the people it used to be done with.  The jobs didn't move, they just plain don't need to be done any more.  \n\nAnd nobody staring at a rusted out factory and wondering how they're going to afford next months rent wants to be told \"It's your fault for not changing.  You need to be better educated and move away from the only home you've ever lived in if you want to get a job that will support your family the way the past 5 generations have supported their family right where you're sitting.\"\n\nIt's easier to blame the nebulous \"Them\" than to change yourself, your life, your *everything.*  It's easier to hope the jobs are coming back rather than admit they didn't actually go anywhere.  Wouldn't you vote for someone who at least acknowledged there was a problem and claimed to be able to fix it?  The fact that it's unfixable is largely irrelevant, because what else can you even do?",

Because in their mind he is sticking it to the liberals and that's all they care about. In the end, the GOP will be held accountable. If he manages to hang on for his full term, he will, by that time, have done irreparable harm to the GOP. And probably assured that it will be a long time before they have another shot. I am not sure that they realize that though. In their zeal to gain control, they have fucked the party... hard.\n\nThe country is moving more towards the center and left so the right is freaking out. The conservative dinosaurs will be gone soon enough. This is more than likely one of the last elections in which (largely) uninformed boomers will factor in to such an extent as they did in this last one. The majority if fed up with this nonsense. The more reasonable folks to the center and the left will not be very forgiving of this little experiment.",

They are the corrupt of the corrupt which exists in every society.  They are only afforded power because people elect and give it to them.

This is happening now because if the generation between 20 and 40. They could have swayed this election, but stayed home, or even voted third party. They can't even decipher the difference between the new York times, CNN, WSJ, and some Latvian website. ",

The reason why a lot of facts are discarded by these groups is pretty clear in several circumstances: we've rewarded things like fairy tale and magic beliefs in this country under the guise of \"religious freedom\" that has supported the idea that you can have your own individual facts as a special snowflake of a person you are and you are so entitled to it too!  Who cares about facts?  You're a special person with special beliefs - you have every right to infringe on truth because of that!  Right?\n\nWith the invent of social media and broadening technology to more and more people, isolationist and bubbles form reinforcing your core beliefs while discarding ones you dislike by simply ignoring them.  With the concept of confirmation bias, technology, and a disdain for facts your ego doesn't agree with, we've seen this huge portion of population that seem to think - as I quote Asimov:\n\n>There is a cult of ignorance in the United States, and there always has been. The strain of **anti-intellectualism has been a constant thread winding its way through our political and cultural life, nurtured by the false notion that democracy means that \"my ignorance is just as good as your knowledge.\"**\n",
