The applauses would last for hours.\n\nHere's an exerpt from Solzhenitsn who wrote about it:\n\n>*At the conclusion of the conference, a tribute to Comrade Stalin was called for. Of course, everyone stood up (just as everyone had leaped to his feet during the conference at every mention of his name). ... For three minutes, four minutes, five minutes, the stormy applause, rising to an ovation, continued. But palms were getting sore and raised arms were already aching. And the older people were panting from exhaustion. It was becoming insufferably silly even to those who really adored Stalin.*\n\n>*However, who would dare to be the first to stop? \u2026 After all, NKVD men were standing in the hall applauding and watching to see who would quit first! And in the obscure, small hall, unknown to the leader, the applause went on \u2013 six, seven, eight minutes! They were done for! Their goose was cooked! They couldn\u2019t stop now till they collapsed with heart attacks! At the rear of the hall, which was crowded, they could of course cheat a bit, clap less frequently, less vigorously, not so eagerly \u2013 but up there with the presidium where everyone could see them?*\n\n>*The director of the local paper factory, an independent and strong-minded man, stood with the presidium. Aware of all the falsity and all the impossibility of the situation, he still kept on applauding! Nine minutes! Ten! In anguish he watched the secretary of the District Party Committee, but the latter dared not stop. Insanity! To the last man! With make-believe enthusiasm on their faces, looking at each other with faint hope, the district leaders were just going to go on and on applauding till they fell where they stood, till they were carried out of the hall on stretchers! And even then those who were left would not falter\u2026*\n\n>*Then, after eleven minutes, the director of the paper factory assumed a businesslike expression and sat down in his seat. And, oh, a miracle took place! Where had the universal, uninhibited, indescribable enthusiasm gone? To a man, everyone else stopped dead and sat down. They had been saved!*\n\n>*The squirrel had been smart enough to jump off his revolving wheel. That, however, was how they discovered who the independent people were. And that was how they went about eliminating them. That same night the factory director was arrested. They easily pasted ten years on him on the pretext of something quite different. But after he had signed Form 206, the final document of the interrogation, his interrogator reminded him:*\n\n>*\u201cDon\u2019t ever be the first to stop applauding.\u201d*\n\nhttps://mannerofspeaking.org/2010/05/12/some-chilling-public-speaking-history/  ",

Most Americans didn't vote at all because they didn't like either candidate - but thought that would lead to a palatable Clinton Presidency, not a Trump dictatorship.  Most of us don't want this.  \n\nThere's hope that we turn back the tide in 2018 but I'm losing hope by the day here, especially with that whole \"let's have bills of attainder now\" thing out of Congress.  The institutions of democracy have broken down in this country and it's reasonably likely that the whole system of checks and balances will be straight-up obliterated in two years, and it's equally likely that Republicans will effectively suppress enough voters in *their* states to lock out democracy from having a meaningful effect in the future.

Nope, Trump will publicize every move they make and shit they take, and make it very difficult to blame the democrats for their stupidity. Of course they will, but they've got a guy who doesn't know how to play their game; and honestly thinks they've got good ideas. If nothing else, Trump is earnest in his idiocy, and it's going to get them in all kinds of hot water.\n\nYou're one of the first people I've seen mention this. Sorry for babbling your head off.

Anyway, due to a lack of wedge issues and gerrymandered parliament, the federal government roughly approximates the people by region, and avoids extremism.\n\n\n The Conservative party won't vote for a crazy as their leader they'll choose a moderate because the moderates or those who want to win more liberal ridings don't want a wacko interfering with their regional election. It's basically the opposite of the primary system in terms of polarization, and it's also generally not corrupt. Nothing compared to the US which has decades of entrenched layered corruption. It's like if voting for your congressman was also voting for your president, and the congressmen choose the president to be voted on with them, in this way the congressmen (MPs) will choose someone moderate and non devisive. This + Gerrymandering + way better election laws + better educated more liberal more urban population + voter turn out and youth involvement = we're good.\n\n",
