    "body": "Hey so this is my state and and I've worked in this legislature so this is interesting. Just a heads up: there is no tiebreaking vote for a tied House of Delegates. The Lt. Gov casts a tiebreaking vote in the state senate which is currently 21-19.\n\nThere is no written process for how to tiebreak in the VA House of Delegates. The last time a 50-50 split occurred was in 1998 and that was dealt with through a bipartisan power sharing agreement. Therefore, we have no idea who the next speaker will be. No clue which party either.\n\nIf y'all have any questions feel free to ask.\n\nEDIT: Hey so this has gotten a lot of attention. I love my state government, so I'll definitely keep answering all the questions y'all have. However, I just got PMed a Star Wars spoiler approximately 4 and a half hours before I was going to see it, so any further answers shall wait until after that.\n\nEDIT 2: While y'all are here, I recommend you look into the current governor of VA: Terry McAuliffe. Quite frankly, after living in this state all my life, he's who I want to run for president in 2020. He's led the state through great economic success. He's ardently protected civil rights, vetoing the most legislation of any VA governor and prohibiting discrimination based on sexual orientation on his first day as governor. The Virginia constitution takes away the right to vote from felons. Governor McAuliffe attempted to restore many nonviolent ex-felon's rights through an executive order, but was told no by the VA supreme court. So instead he's restored the rights of 13,000 people individually. He's pretty great.",

He, was a real down to earth guy, definitely focused on the environment. I believe he's the first governor to visit all VA state parks during his term in office. The governor, his family, and staff all came out after dinner (it was an event for all the state parks) and looked through the telescopes we setup (we being amateur astronomers). Terry even came back at 2-3AM to see Saturn. I'm pretty sure the man never sleeps.\n\nI don't pretend to have a full grasp of all his policies and such, but he struck me as more honest than most people of importance (e.g. politicians, CEOs, etc) and he seemed to genuinely care about the things he was talking to you about. His wife was just as interested and involved as he was.\n\nIf he ran for President he'd have my vote.",

Many of these new democratic legislators ran on redistricting reform, and there were members of the GOP before that were willing to cross the aisle on the issue. This brings this back into the realm of possibility.\n\nThe budget will be major. Our outgoing governor, Terry McAuliffe, placed medicaid expansion in his proposed budget recently. Virginia's constitution has a balanced budget amendment, so the 50/50 split will make this much more contentious and actually makes medicaid expansion a possibility for the state.\n\nThe GOP have held the majority for 18 years.

Republicans then received a share of committee chairmanships and most committees were divided equally on party lines. However, due to the lack of a majority party, the House was extremely chaotic throughout that time.\n\nWhat we have here in VA right now is different for two major reasons. First, the state is much more polarized now. Virginia has been a relatively moderate state for its history, and that late 90s early 00s period was probably where we were the most bipartisan. No way this happens as cleanly again.\n\nSecond, we have no incumbent speaker. Republican Bill Howell retired and didn't run for re-election. His chosen successor Kirk Cox will likely be backed by the Republicans, but a new face backed by the former incumbent part is fundamentally different from an incumbent speaker. So we have no incumbent and no clear guide for leadership. This will make the negotiations that much more difficult. \n\nTL;DR: Power sharing agreement last time was decided between the two parties at that time. No standing policy, so it must be renegotiated, but it'll be way  more chaotic this time.",

    "body": "> thanks southpark\n\n**Rant**\n\nOne of the most frustrating things I kept running into during the election was the both sides argument.  \n  \n\"Both sides are the same, we're just choosing between a Giant Douche and a Turd Sandwich!\"  \n  \nFor *years* I've heard that shit, and goddamn if it doesn't piss me off every time.  I love South Park, and while I don't always agree with them, I have to admit that the show does a decent job of exploring current events and politics through a satirical lens.  Yeah, I'm liberal as fuck, and they're libertarian as fuck, but by and large Stone and Parker are good about presenting both sides of an issue.  \n  \nSo imagine what folks who feel similarly about South Park think when they see this show that they like, created by writers that they respect, runs an entire episode about how voting doesn't matter because nothing ever changes.  The viewers take that seriously, as a thoughtful criticism of our political system, an accurate reflection of reality seen through a funhouse mirror.  \n  \n(And yes, I've heard many times that: \"But they said that the Giant Douche was the good one, because douches are useful and Turd Sandwiches aren't!\"  If that was the moral that viewers had taken away from the episode we wouldn't be having this discussion, but that's *not* the moral they took away.)  \n \nI love Jon Stewart, I respect his opinion and his thoughtfulness, if he came out and told me that Democrats and Republicans were identical, were the same, I probably would have reevaluated how I think about politics.  But there's a reason Stewart never did that, because he knows it's bullshit.  \n  \n\"Giant Douche and Turd Sandwich\" *I* feel has done real harm to our political discussion.  It's a pithy little throw away phrase that people can use to kill a conversation in its tracks, a thoughtless and contextless placeholder for considered opinions founded on facts and evidence, a social virus of the mind.  It's a meme, and a fuckin' shitty one at that.  \n  \nI love South Park, it's funny, it's smart, it's thoughtful.  If one could be said to respect a cartoon show that started off with an alien shoving an entire spy satellite up Cartman's ass, then I respect the show; and the show has a responsibility to its audience *to live up to that respect.*  Giant Douche and Turd Sandwich are so far divorced from modern politics that we might as well be talking about the whigs and the bull moose party.  Douche and Turd is like having this great girlfriend, she's funny and smart, but there was that one time she wrote an op-ed about how we should burn the homeless as fuel that just never sat right with me.  \n  \n---  \n  \nEdit: Objections.  \n  \nI'm seeing two main objections in the comments, and I'd like to address them.  \n  \n**\"The episode was written in 2004, it was a different time, the parties *were* the same back then!\"**  \n***No.***  Al Gore and George Bush are not the same.  John Kerry and George Bush are not the same.  \n  \n**\"But it's true, South Park was right, the parties are the same!\"**  \n***No,*** the party that just let Net Neutrality die is not the same as the party trying to save it.  \n***No,*** the party that has been trying to privatize Medicare for the past half decade is not the same as the party flirting with Medicare For All.  \n***No,*** the party that immediately set to detoothing and neutering the Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform Bill is not the same as the party that passed it.  \n***No,*** the party that held the middle class hostage to defend Bush era tax cuts is not the same as the party that begged to raise taxes on the top 1%.  \n***No,*** the party that included a provision in tax reform to raise taxes on college students is not the same as the party trying to make college debt free.  \n***No,*** the party that is trying to pass a $1,500,000,000,000.00 ($1.5tn) tax cut for millionaires and billionaires is not the same as the party opposing it.  \n***No,*** the party that has spent the past eight years doing everything in their power to destroy the Affordable Care Act is not the same as the party protecting it.  \n***No,*** the party that regularly and loudly speak out against the very existence of a minimum wage is not the same as the party trying to raise it to $12-$15 per hour.  \n***No,*** the party that fear mongered about \"What happens if a woman gets her period during a firefight!?\" is not the same as the party working to give women equal roles in combat.  \n***No,*** the party passing trap laws and requiring Doctors to perform medically unnecessary transvaginal ultrasounds is not the same as the party fighting for a woman's right to choose.  \n***No,*** the party that wants to pass a constitutional amendment defining marriage as being between one man and one woman is not the same as the party fighting to protect gay rights.  \n***No,*** the party that is going out of their way at the state and federal level to make voting harder to do is not the same as the party fighting for more polling places and longer early voting.  \n***No,*** the party that believes \"Climate change is a Chinese hoax\" and \"God promised Noah he would never flood the earth again\" and \"Look, I have a snowball\" is not the same as the party that believes in science.  \n\nStill don't believe me that the parties aren't the same?  Okay, riddle me this, do you know which party is which in the examples I listed above?  Because unless you think that Democrats have been fighting to overturn Roe vs Wade, and Republicans are trying to raise the minimum wage, then you have no excuse for believing the \"they're the same!\" talking point.  I didn't mention one single party name in that list, but you, dear reader, you knew *exactly* who I was talking about.  \n\n***Yeah,*** there is *some* shit that the parties line up on, policies that both parties support like CHIP (Until this year, when Republicans let it die) or the Violence Against Women Act (Until Republicans almost let it lapse during the Obama years), or raising the debt ceiling (Until tea party Republicans almost didn't raise it), but those commonalities are father and father between, and hardly reflect the reality of modern American politics.  No, the parties aren't the same.   ",

She hated the show, and altho I'd still go out of my way to watch it without her, I never watched it with the same fervor that I did, say, in college. And the last two or 3 seasons I think I've missed in near totality. Not that I don't like the show, but I just can't get into it like I used to. Not for nothing, but I couldn't help but feel like maybe their brand of cable channel nihilism, and nothing-is-sacred sense of humor (hysterical as it often was) helped to put us in this shit storm",

It's just that South Park predates the sort of internet discourse needed to dissect something like this, so it's just a sort of constant variable for most people. South Park, imo, is innately harmful to our culture and political climate.\n\nIt's the attitudes like these that gave birth to /b/ and /pol/, and eventually the alt-right, however much it pains me to admit. I do genuinely think that shows like South Park played at least *some* role in creating literal 21st century nazis.  \n\nMy generation is not perfect, and instead of the just usual fight upward (that is, the fight of the younger generation against their parents), it seems to be a lateral challenge as well. We're fight ourselves as well as our parents and it's becoming increasingly difficult to do either one. \n   \n\nEdit: spelling\n\nEdit 2: There's actually more I want to say.\n",

    "body": "South Park is the absolute king of 'pithy little throw away phrases', from that example, to member berries, to ginger souls, to 'my vagina', Trey & Matt focus heavily on condensing topical issues into little catchphrases that quickly populate the zeitgeist. The thing is, they come at it from a humour perspective before considering how their words might be used or misconstrued. Which is also why they've used PC culture as a punching bag so heavily, because they don't understand it. They don't want to accept any part of the responsibility for causing things like hundreds of gingers kids getting assaulted. And while I agree Amy Schumer is a mediocre comedian, reddit still constantly uses 'my vagina' as *the* reason without considering that the content is unrelated to her ability to form a joke, and both great and terrible male comedians talk about their dicks & balls constantly.\n\nNow, somewhat in South Park's defense, they do root these premises in absurdism. But they underestimate how many young kids/teen watch their show, and are easily influenced by the very bite-sized snippets they put forth. Malcolm Gladwell doesn't specifically talk about South Park, but he does cover the issues I have with it very well [on his podcast](http://revisionisthistory.com/episodes/10-the-satire-paradox).",

The filibuster is fine, the problem is that they all decided that actually filibustering was hard work, and decided to change the rules to give every single senator veto power.\n\nThe Filibuster, as designed, is one of those things that's supposed to be so serious you stake your career on it because making the news for shutting down the legislature over something has a very strong chance of pissing off the people able to vote on you.  It's you saying \"This matter is *so goddamned important* that it's worth grinding the entire legislature to a halt over\", and you believe so strongly in it that you're willing to take a stand that forgoes food, sleep, even toilet breaks until one of three things happens: You back down, they back down, or you annoy so many senators that they collectively *make* you back down (via a Cloture Motion, which requires a 2/3rds majority).\n\nThe problem is, it's also hard work.  To actually Filibuster, you have to be granted the floor and then refuse to return it when your allotted time is up. If you leave the floor, stop talking for more than a certain period of time, etc...game over.  The floor gets returned, and business continues as usual.\n\nSo, during GW's term, a bunch of powerful senators got together and decided to change the rules.  That's too much like work, so instead now all a senator has to do is declare their \"intention\" to filibuster, they skip actually seizing the floor/etc and go straight to a Cloture motion.  If that can't pass, the measure dies immediately.\n\nIt theoretically saves everyone a ton of time, but it also has three side effects: one, Filibusters become trivial, something that requires no skin in the game, no risk, and no effort.  Two, it means that a Filibuster can't be busted by the person doing it giving up.  \n\nThree, and most importantly, it effectively gives every single senator the power to unilaterally kill an order of business, be it a bill, a nomination, whatever.  While not technically identical, it's close enough for government work ^^\\(HA!\\) to call it the same as senators having veto power...a power that's supposed to be reserved for the POTUS.  Getting 67 votes in the senate on anything is effectively impossible given how deeply partisan it's become, so in practice \"I intend to filibuster\" is no different from \"I veto this bill\".\n\nThat's the bullshit that needs to go, but don't ever expect a body able to change its rules in its own self-interest to ever make things harder on themselves.",
