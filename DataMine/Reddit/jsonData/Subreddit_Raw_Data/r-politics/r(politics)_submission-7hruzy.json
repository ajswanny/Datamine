Maybe it backfires, maybe not but it's a deserved attack.\n\nI've been saying for weeks now, Jones attacks on Moore have been too professionally courteous. It normalizes Moore's behavior down to a political disagreement.\n\nSexual Misconduct and 32 year olds dating teenagers is not a political disagreement it's creepy as fuck at best, and criminal at worst.\n\nConventional wisdom is getting personal with the attacks will backfire but I'm not so sure with conservative voters. But even if it doesn't get votes, at the very least you beat Moore up so bad , that nationally he becomes an albatross for the GOP.",

My assailant did not hold a position of power and in my case the perpetrator was not found, therefore he was not stopped and held accountable.  I have wondered if the man continued to assault underage  girls or did his assaults worsen to rape, kidnap or murder.  Many people have come forward concerning the male republican running for the US Senate in Alabama.  He has held positions of power in the past, apparently he did he use his power to keep his victims silent.  Will the people of Alabama have the courage it will take to not reward this man with a seat in the US Senate?",

Whatever fuckery they get away with won't be due to lack of effort on our part, I'll tell you that. The people who are voting for Doug are just as passionate and determined as the R side!",

These tenets form the main stratum of what can be termed popular or universal belief.
