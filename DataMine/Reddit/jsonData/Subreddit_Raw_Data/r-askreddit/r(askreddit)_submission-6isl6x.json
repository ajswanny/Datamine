    "body": "Perhaps not entirely what the question asked, but I need to get this off my chest.\n\n\nAbout 10 years ago, I was asked to come in for an interview for selling Bose speakers at one of their B2B outlets. It was an entirely professional deal, and the HR guy on the phone could not stress enough how important knowledge about sound systems was. So I go in and only one other guy shows up. We assume they need more people, so we both fancy our chances. only thing is this guy has no idea how speakers work, no idea what or who Bose is, and displayed a generally carefree attitude. At least he was wearing a shirt and not a polo with his jeans and sneakers.\n\nI get called first, and my interview went on for over 30 minutes, getting grilled about all things imaginable and then some more. I was pretty confident about the material ('coz I knew that stuff!) and I thought it went really well. So i come out and this guy is shitting bricks because he did not realize this was a \"serious job interview.\" We had built up some rapport while waiting, so when he asked me if I could wait for him for some moral support (we were headed back to the same area too), I said okay.\n\nHis interview lasted 5 minutes. He walked out with an offer letter. All they asked him was his name and his background. I was politely asked to reapply after 12 months.\n\n\nThis guy was equally confused. He was not a scumbag, in fact, he was a really nice guy. But even when you are selling high end conference room sound systems to people who have no time to even listen to your pitch, Bose wanted good looks over skills.\n\nDid I mention this guy looked like a cross between Christopher Reeve and Elvis Presley?",

I told him you gotta expect that a bit but he says it was a crazy amount like he felt tricked. Anyway, after knowing she was not very attractive, he said she was awful at conversations, very boring, asking the same repetitive questions to not let a conversation die. Looking back on his old texts, she was always awful at conversation (him too tbf) but he was never 'bored' when he thought it was a really hot girl asking about his day at work or his college program etc     \n\nEdit: My friend doesn't Reddit so I'll show him this comment thread tomorrow haha I wonder what he'll think when he see's 8000 people read his story (sorry man) ",

We were in the drivers seat of a car and I was pinned between my seat and the steering wheel on top of me, and I wasn't wearing a condom. I was shoving at her and yelling, but I had no room to move my legs at all and had basically no physical leverage in that position. So she held me down and got what she wanted. I hated it.\n\nYes, female-on-male rape is a real thing.\n\nI told her she raped me and she laughed in my face. Meanwhile I'm over here like \"I don't know if I just got this crazy bitch pregnant, also how the fuck did she just remove my personal agency.\"\n\nIt was horrible and confusing and disorienting, because it's hard for men to really process the idea that it can happen to us too.\n\nWhen I started telling people, at least 3/4 of them didn't believe me or blatantly didn't take me seriously in any way at all. Several simply changed the subject. The consensus was \"You're whining because your hot girlfriend let you cum in her, how stupid are you?\"\n\nBut if I'd told people a fat, homely friend of mine held me down and raped me, they'd have believed me with little question.\n\nI can't even imagine how it must be for women who get assaulted by very attractive men. \n\nAnd people wonder why most victims don't report shit, and people wonder how Cosby admitted in a deposition that he gave women quaaludes and then fucked them but somehow got a mistrial.

Since she couldn't really help anyone with a computer problem, she generally just answered the phones.  But the amazing thing was that when she asked someone in the department (everyone else was male), either intern or full-timer, to go take care of an issue, they would jump at the chance.  Help desk calls, which used to be the absolute worst part about the job, became an opportunity for some socially awkward males to interact with a beautiful woman.\n\nIronically, having hired someone who knew next to nothing about the subject at hand, the help desk never ran better.

I got walked into more often when I was huge, even though I was clearly visible and keeping over to the side to leave room for people to pass etc. It's like they genuinely don't register you as a human.  \n\nAnd yes for the people going out of their way to mention their unavailability or lack of interest. Like, \"Hi, sorry, could you point me to the train station?\" would get a \"it's that way, my *girlfriend* uses trains all the time.\" Uh... thanks, mate?

I honestly don't consider myself conventionally 'beautiful' but learning to be outgoing and having confidence has changed my life in so many ways (regardless of all the awkwardness it took to reach there). Being confident has lead to me actually liking myself, I don't find myself seeking the validation of people as much as I used to... I've become happy. If you find the people around you aren't receptive to the changes you make it may be time to find people who uplift you rather than inhibit your happiness (a great group of friends can do more for your confidence imo than anything else). \n\nI hope that you find the happiness you deserve friend, no one deserves to go through life thinking that life is better when they're invisible.

If you don't golf, still attracts some big tournaments which is neat\n\n* Rochester is both the Flower City from lilacs and the Flour City from its history in grain milling. If you can't appreciate a pun then get out. \n\n* Erie Canal, scenic af. Everyone has mules named Sal. *Everyone*\n\n* Garbage Plates\n\n* The Buffalo Bills (S/O /r/BuffaloBills) have their training camp every summer in Pittsford. Come see a top 32 American Football team slip on rubber mats for free\n\nOne of my favorite quotes about Western New York comes form Syracuse Men's Basketball coach Jim Boeheim, is from outside of Syracuse and almost took the job at the University of Rochester but he got the Syracuse job instead. In this quote ([from a 2003 ESPN article](http://www.espn.com/ncb/ncaatourney03/columnist?id=1532880)) he's talking about Syracuse, but I think it nicely illustrates the candor of many born and raised in our neck of the woods, and I feel exactly the same way about Rochester: \n\n> Boeheim isn't just Mr. Syracuse Basketball, but Mr. Syracuse. As the old story goes, Boeheim was sitting on the beach in Hawaii with his former assistant, Rick Pitino, and Pitino's wife, Joanne. Someone proposed a question: If you could live anywhere, where it would be?\n\n> Hawaii? San Francisco? New York City? Come on, Syracuse is the only place to be.\nRick picked San Francisco.\n\n> Joanne picked New York City.\n\n> \"Syracuse,\" the pasty Boeheim said in the sand.\n\n> What?\n\n> \"Syracuse.\"\n\n> Hawaii was just Syracuse in July, Boeheim sniffed.\n\n> \"For eight months a year, it's the best weather in the country,\" Boeheim said. \"The other four months, we're playing basketball.\n\nAbove all, the hearty sense of community that Rochester has is simply second to none. The immediate connection made with someone who is familiar with our little corner of the world is something very special that just isn't the same in bigger cities. The Rochester metro area has about 1 Million people and at times it feels like everyone knows everyone. \n\nIt's an amazing place to call home. \n\n/r/Rochester",
