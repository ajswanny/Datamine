    "body": "This has been a fascinating read! I'm on the young side, but currently work as a high school educator. My family has also been running the same experiential education business for about 3 generations, so most of my answer will draw from that. We have anecdotal observations running from the '50s to now, and a few journals/texts from others who did similar work using basically the same model all the way back to the 1920s. \n\nBear in mind these are nontraditional education environments - but they are consistent across decades. We worked with school groups and individual kids in wilderness and camp settings, but it's fair to say that these settings were consistently educational. All of our programs have been built around the notion of given young people power, agency, and choice very explicitly - our programs exist for them to explore community and society building on their own, with mentorship from adults but little direct interference. So I can't speak so much to how students perform on busy work and homework over time, but can certainly speak to values and abilities in the broader sense. **Also, one important conversation that has been missed - childhood for priveleged kids largely on the \"college track\" and filled with activities these days is VERY different from childhood for poorer kids where that might not be the expectation, and schedules tend to be a lot less full**. I've worked with kids coming from both types of school system and tracks, and the experiences are different. \n\n A lot of what I've seen matches what I am seeing people right here, including: \n\n* '17 kids are professional, polite, and generally better behaved than their counterparts in the past\n* (therefore?) '17 kids are more responsive to authority, but also afraid of it/reliant on it\n* '17 kids are definitely more tech saavy, no surprises there\n* Ironically, these kids are harder to influence - their sources of knowledge and inspiration go beyond you. So despite being more responsive to authority, they are less responsive to traditional tools for convincing people to change their minds (i.e. discussion, reverse psychology never works when my grandpa and folks older than him said it was a reliable tool, etc...) - odds are good they've been exposed to your information already. \n* When I give kids from '17 free time, without access to technology, they literally can't figure out what to do\n\nThat last point is most striking for me, but you can see it everywhere - boredom has largely been rooted out of existence. There is always something to do. We used to see a lot more self-organizing activity among young people (getting together to play live music, making up a game, etc...) and now we find ourselves having to intervene more often to keep kids from just sitting. They struggle to develop their own initiatives and activities. \n\nBut I think this whole thing is premised on the wrong question. We need to ask **whats the difference between 1997, 2007, and 2017 PARENTS?**\n\nAll of these traits of kids are natural consequences of the way they are raised: \n\n* They are bad at making plans because they never have to make them - days are filled with activities their parents put on their plates. Kids may self-select, but often because of college pressure from parents\n* They are responsive to authoritarianism because they really haven't experienced freedom (due to the above, and because there are so many rules now - and so much more surveillance), both in school and at home\n* They stay in contact with their parents BECAUSE THEIR PARENTS MAKE THEM DO IT. I shifted to wilderness programs in part because this makes technology moot - service doesn't reach the places I go. But parents FLIP at this. In camps, where phones are forbidden, kids generally are much more willing to do this than parents are. Parents want that daily check-in. Kids sometimes do, but less often.\n\nBut there are plenty of reasons for this. Back in the day, my grandfather would have kids out in the woods building their own huts. They literally built much of the camp they operated on. The kids were expected to come in and help cook in the kitchen. A few hours before lunch, when people were hungry, kids would need to come help make meals or meals wouldn't happen. So kids figured out norms of self-governance to ensure that people would go help in the kitchens. Sometimes it was people who wanted to cook doing it all the time. Sometimes there was a schedule so everybody cooked. We didn't care, but it had to happen. \n\nI couldn't really do this today without a lot of legal risk I'm not willing to take on as a small business. So I've shifted to smaller wilderness based programs where we have a bit more flexibility (less of an expectation of consistent meal times, for example). Kids have to cook for themselves in small groups. I've devised something I call the \"rule of 3 days\" - I won't run a trip using our typical non-interfering strategy for less than 3 days, because it takes that long for kids to get into the swing of things, cooking for themselves, making plans, etc... The first 3 days are brutal, because the kids are taking a lot of time to come around to the fact that my staff are absolutely refusing to make plans or decisions for them. They have to do it. In many cases (and these kids are 14, 15, 16) it's really the first time they've ever been GIVEN responsibility, and it's the first time they're making a serious decision that could impact their lives 24/7 over several days. \n\nI do want to emphasize that the kids do come around to this, eventually. It's taking longer than in the past, but they are ultimately no less capable - but I have the advantage of an environment where I can remove the technology and all adults present are agreeing to not intervene short of major safety issues (we actually have 4 \"thresholds\" where we'll intervene). I work in a high school currently, and without those factors it's hard to get the same results. \n\nI try not to blame the kids. I try to think about the world these kids are growing up in, even without factoring in the parents: \n\n* Less abandoned land - even in suburbs, the tracts of land kids could once trespass on with little consequence are vastly diminished. A more litigious society means there is a greater risk to kids running free on your property, so that means more fences and more regulated spaces, over less spaces in general. My dad grew up exploring woods in rural areas in what is now a national park - the parkland has more regulations, obviously, but most of the other places he grew up playing and exploring are now more heavily monitored because there are more private landowners, and less accessible. This is true all over the region (and we're in a woodsy part of the world! With more people in cities, it's even crazier!)\n\n* More litigious society. I run the same essential business as my grandparents, but I have to follow significantly more regulations to make it happen, and that limits my operating abilities. The crazy stuff they used to do (kids building buildings, traveling without a guide, etc...) could easily be read as negligent now. Insurance wouldn't cover me. Parents wouldn't trust me. I simply can't give kids the same experience and continue as a responsible operator. Remember this - what is one regulation your lawmakers will ALWAYS be willing to pass? One that \"protects the children.\"\n\n* More monitoring. Cameras. Baby monitors. Text message updates. We're just used to hearing from each other more often, so kids are raised with the understanding that your parents know where you are and will be able to reach you. That's normal to them. This is just a product of technology, not any intentional choice. When I went biking through the city as a kid, there was no way to reach my family - they weren't just going to keep me at home. Now that there is a way, there is an expectation that should happen (and you could be seen as negligent if you don't match that expectation!). \n\nA lot of people say that these kids get to college and act like kids, and that's the problem. I think the real problem is the kids get to college, and people expect them to act like kids, build structures and rules around them as though they were, and the kids follow suit. If I've learned one thing in this work, it's that your expectation for what the capabilities of young people are almost universally puts the defining limit on what their capabilities actually are. People generally don't rise to the occassion. They generally fall to the level of their training. So if you build a system where young people see a lot of structure, rules, and guidelines that match their historic expectations (i.e. a college system that largely governs them as though they were still minors), you should expect them to continue along that historic trend. If high schools have as much structure as middle schools, and colleges as much structure as high school, and entry level jobs have as much structure as colleges, you won't see a change. \n\nWe NEED more people and programs out there disrupting these patterns if we want kids to be functioning individuals capable of developing their own structures, governing their own lives, and making decisions. These are really important skills, and they aren't replaced by tech saavy, strong work ethic, or the other (very real) \"pros\" of the current generation. ",

    "body": "Graduated high school and went to college in the late 90s, started teaching at the college level in mid-2000s, still teaching at the college level.\n\nI would say that in general I didn't notice much of a difference between when I went to college and when I started teaching at college. I went to a state school, I now teach at a (different) state school. Students generally got done what they needed to get done, partied, enjoyed chatting and having fun in the classroom, and more or less seemed to live their lives fairly similarly to how I did.\n\nThe last few years have been different, and I'm not entirely sure why, and it is specifically the last few years when the shift occurred. I've spoken with numerous other teachers about this, and everyone I talk to about it that's been teaching for a while seems to have noticed. \n\nAs people have noted, students now are more diligent. They work really hard, they're polite, quiet, but are woefully unprepared for adulthood. Yet, they're almost to the last all fairly \"corporate\" and \"professionalized.\" They act like they are all intending to become middle managers. The idea of college education as anything other than (incredibly expensive) job training is lost on them -- likely due to that \"incredibly expensive\" part. They diligently do busy work, but when asked to do creative, novel, or independent work/analysis, it's like [that screen Chrome browser gives you when it crashes.](https://www.techworm.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/YsxD4.jpg) They're also less anti-authoritarian than I've seen in the past. This is helpful for classroom management, but I worry about a society of people who unquestioningly do busywork, can't think independently, and blindly listen to authority. \n\nIf you think it's just me, all teachers teaching incoming freshman last year had to attend a lecture series given by a couple of the deans regarding the demographics and habits of our incoming freshman.\n\nBasically, the takeaway was this: We should not expect students to be able to pay attention in class. We should not expect students to be able to socialize easily with their classmates. We should not expect students to be able to understand and/or figure out a syllabus. We should not expect students to be able to manage their own personal affairs outside of the classroom. We should not expect them to be able to self-task in terms of research/self-education. We *should* expect more phone calls from parents, more parental intervention, and a heavy reliance on parents by our students who, we were informed, are likely texting their parents during and/or immediately after classes if they get grades they feel are unfair. Most of the \"we should not expect students to be able to do X\" comes from research that the deans cited (I don't remember if it was from our university or published in a journal or what) that shows that most of those issues stem from that extreme reliance on other people, typically parents for younger students, through all of their K-12 education. AKA, their parents did so much for them down to explaining class expectations and how a course works (syllabuses), that now that they're expected to do it on their own, they can't because they've never really done it.\n\nI think the deans maybe were a bit hyperbolic, but most of that does seem to be true for a lot of students now, and I will say this: until three years ago, I had NEVER received a phone call or email from a parent regarding their children's grades and/or academic performance. Since 2014, I have received numerous phone calls and probably a half dozen emails. \n\nYou want to see a helicopter parent lose their shit? Explain to them that their children are legally adults and due to FERPA guidelines, I can't discuss their grades or academic performance with them. So, I don't fault my students necessarily, and I don't know if this is a long-term trend or not, but I definitely have noticed a pretty significant change in my students over the last few years. I also get the sense that they may know that there is something different about them vs. previous generations of college students, as I find them expressing concern about themselves and their classmates.

It is also common to have extremely poor behaviour children misdiagnosed as autistic, when it is more of an issue on the parent's end. Edit: an example would be a situation where the transient Dad was into MMA, and bonded with the child through rough housing. The six year old then ruled over mom in the house because mom couldn't control the kid - no bedtime, eat what they wanted or risk a violent tantrum. This child was initially misdiagnosed with autism, which the parents hid behind that diagnosis as a justification for poor enforcement of behaviour. They also resisted the school's recommendations for the child to be sent to the special behavioural program at a different school for a very long time (at no additional cost, paid transport for the student via taxi, etc).\n\nShe has diaper trained students in kindergarten before.\n\nWhen my mom started her job, she actually taught these students basic skills (obviously student dependent, based on their issue and level of cognition). Now her job is almost entirely behaviour management. It's gone from \"how can I teach this child\" to \"what schedule and methods can we use to prevent a meltdown?\". She generally gets kicked, sworn at, and bruised every day from elementary aged special needs students who are suffering from lack of support in schools and at home. She's not a very strong lady, and is at major risk of injury from using holds to restrain these students when they are at risk of hurting themselves or other students.\n\nThe other faculty seem to have adopted the ministry's stance that the EAs are nonessential. She's worked at schools where they were not permitted at staff meetings. Edit: to clarify this is more the principal who adopted this stance. The teachers are extremely supportive and work with my mother and defend EAs.\n\nParents now turn against them, because all they hear from their behavioural child is that Mrs _____ is mean. Edit: example would be if she stops the student from eating the entire contents of their lunch bag at morning recess because the student has food hoarding issues (before you mention it, children's aid was involved with this case). But the student goes home and tells mom that mrs. _____ wouldn't let them eat and mom gets mad.\n\nShe's trying to tough it out until retirement in 6 years but she hates her job every day.

    "body": "Graduated HS in 93. Taught middle school. I noticed a definite change regarding phones/social media. Went through the whole adjustment of no one having a phone to trying to enforce rules about phones to just dealing with them. (From a teachers perspective, I'd like to smash the shit out of their phones when they're using them in class. Kids think they are sneaky, some are really not.) anyway, went from kids being dicks about phones to now being cool and better about being polite about it. Definitely more parental involvement now as opposed to 10 yrs ago.  I feel students today want to be told exactly what to do and won't risk trying to figure it out on their own. (My husband just hired two assistants who are 22 & 23 in his job-- he says they are constantly needing guidance for stuff they should be able to figure out on their own. It's just interesting that he is seeing it as well and has nothing to do with education.)  students today are more aware of\nSocial issues. Most Kids in 1997 weren't thinking about equality and immigration or anything political. Now kids are much more informed And mostly more tolerant. Kids today do not seem to care about being outside as much. Probably bc the media overdose has everyone convinced there's a pervert or murderer behind ever bush. I find myself spending ridiculous amounts of time on my phone looking at Reddit, and other digital entertainment. It is strange to realize how it feels like a waste of time. In 1997 this was not a problem. So, it is not just changing students, it is a change in all of us. Teaching has certainly become a lot cooler as far as the technology goes. Not so much with the administrative interference.",

Think of the music of the time, Smashing Pumpkins, NIN, and the like.  \"In spite all my rage I am still just a rat in a cage\"\n\nIn 07 the word was Mope.  Kids were softening up, being nicer to eachother, but also getting more into the \"Sadness is beautiful\" kind of thing.  They weren't **angry** at the adults so much as they just wanted them to go away and hide into their hoodies.  \"Leave me alone to my solitude.\"  Consider the way Emo was huge at this time.  \n\nIn 17 kids are MUCH nicer to each other.  They're kind to young kids and friendlier in general... but there's this strange undercurrent of competition to be \"The Most Good Person\" which leads to the weird \"Yes Mayonnaise is a gender if that's how you identify\" kind of thing.

If I fail or get a poor grade, that drags down my GPA and can seriously mess up my options for the future. If college admissions see a 3.0 and a 3.2 from applicants from the same background, they'll probably take the 3.2. So bam. Because you took a risk, you cant get into the college you wanted to. Colleges don't see that you challenged yourself and took a risk and learned from your failure, they see the failure itself and dismiss you for it. \nThat mindset - one of, \"you have to be perfect and don't mess this up OR ELSE\" - is one that I see ALL OVER. So much is expected of me that it's hard to take risk and deal with failure because not only do you have yourself to beat up over it, but everyone around you also berates you for it. \nIt's hard to take risks when it seems like your entire self worth and future is at stake. \n\nStandard disclaimer - I was not in school before the 2000s. This is my experience as a student and member of the younger generation. \n\nEdit: A lot of people are giving advice directly to me. First of all, thank you!

    "body": "Not a teacher, but I am a freshman in college who has talked to a number of people about this subject. If anything, I can offer at least one, hopefully insightful perspective.\n\nThe main comparisons for my experiences come from those of my father. He would have been the super-nerd of his time. He never missed a day of school, even if he was sick, he was offered a full ride to the university he attended after applying to the most difficult college they had (simply because he wanted to), he pursued numerous undergraduate research opportunities, and years later he received his doctorate in nuclear physics. This man has been a driving force in my life, and he's pushed me to do better than even he could. Nowadays, he jokes about how I'm even nerdier than he is, and we continuously have discussions about the differences between generations.\nOne of the things we have noticed is that for current students, everything is extremely competitive. Far more competitive than anything he saw during his education. According to my father, I am doing better than he was at my age. My grades in high school were better, I had far more extracurriculars, I was far more involved with school programs, and I learned much more about STEM than he had at my age by the time I graduated. Even with all of that, I was rejected from most of the universities I applied to. If I was lucky, I was deferred or wait-listed, but ultimately my choice came down to two schools. In the end, I chose the same school my father attended, but I received a much smaller scholarship and currently face higher tuitions. I, like a lot of students I know, had to make up the difference with money from our own savings accounts, even after taking out loans. Naturally, I may have received fewer opportunities simply because I was less deserving or not qualified. Maybe I felt too entitled and came off too cocky. I would say this is the case, except every friend I had who was equally capable if not more so ended up in the same circumstances as myself. Despite being one of the most academically successful classes in my high school's history, my class got into fewer schools and received smaller scholarships than past years. We were basically destroyed by the college application process, and the only consolation we had was that it happened to everyone.\n\nEven in high school there was this prevailing sense of competition. There was a clear division between the \"AP students\" and the rest of the school, and that division only seemed to grow during my four years in high school. Within the AP circle, we were constantly being told to pursue STEM careers, to constantly prepare for standardized tests, to do every extracurricular possible, and to accept nothing less than a 4.0 GPA. Almost every AP student I knew suffered from depression or anxiety of one sort or another, and we each had this deafening fear of failure that even now follows us into college. I went to a high school that still used class ranks, and people would often make fun of me for not getting into good schools, despite being valedictorian. This would have absolutely destroyed me if not for the fact that nobody really did. I realize this paragraph does not have much structure to it, but High School was just a horrible experience looking back. There was so much stress, anxiety, and fear for the future. People often cried over 95% test scores and would beat themselves up about it to frightening extents. I have had to talk numerous friends out of suicide, and I'm sad to say that they have had to do the same for me.\nLuckily, we are all finding college to be better experiences. While the classes are harder and we seriously need to start focusing on careers, things seem more optimistic for once in our lives. Some tough grades at the beginning of the year helped to reduce our fear of failure; however, there is still definitely a prevailing sense of competition. I personally am pursuing degrees in both mechanical engineering and government and politics because I hope that I might gain an edge during the career search, especially when it comes to management positions. I have many friends who are doing the same. We are all happy to be done with high school.\n\nSo in my experience, 2017 kids face far more competition and fewer opportunities than 1997 or even 2007 kids. I have read a lot that teachers do not think that students care as much anymore, but I would assert from my experience that we're taught to care too much and end up getting burnt out. Even \"regular\" students or \"trouble\" students  try their hardest at one point or another. I've seen them try harder than some AP kids that I knew, yet they still never quite saw success. This, coupled with teachers giving up on them, seemed to cause them to burn out very quickly, and they often didn't have the support at home or at school to keep pushing them to succeed. \nI guess in summary, the world doesn't seem as bright for 2017 students. There's far more competition, anxiety, and depression, and I think my generation tends to give off negative vibes due to how we express it. I'm sorry for the wall of text and for rambling, and I realize this doesn't quite fit the question; however, I really wanted to get my view out there and to offer a perspective that I hope somebody finds useful.\n\nThank you for those of you who read this.\n\ntl;dr I think 2017 kids face far more competition, anxiety, and fear of failure. They have far less optimism than 1997 and 2007 kids, and it seems that without the proper support, they are far more likely to burnout and give up.\n",

FYI: I taught only in top private schools, so taught almost only the best students. \n\n1967: A willingness to disagree and challenge anything and everything, a desire for moral justice, extreme idealism, a view of the world both romantic (things could be wonderful if we only treated each other with respect) and cynical (many people are in it only for their only good and some people are oligarchs). Getting high grades not a major focus for most, but having a good life was. Getting into a good college was hardly ever a focus of students' lives since many different colleges were seen as just fine. \n\n- Short hair and traditional clothing for the most part (believe it or not). \n\n- Students worked hard but very few were given A's and most did not expect them. Courses were challenging and most students were proud of B's. College was the next step, but any decent college that made you happy was seen as good. \n\n1977: Idealism, enthusiasm, experimentation, and a certain degree of wackiness with many students who were a joy to teach. \n\n- Hair was much longer, clothing much more creative, sometimes quite odd. \n\n- Students willing to work hard, but more expected A's and got them (grade inflation had begun). A great academic shift: Courses had become much more casual, less challenging in many cases. Students now expecting higher grades, but without strong concerns over college. \n\n1987: Suddenly, it seemed everyone only wanted to \"get rich,\" go into business or investments, idealism dropped, self-centeredness rose (Thank you, Ronald Reagan). Students no longer challenged what teachers said, but only wanted to know how to get an \"A\" and get into a good college. \n\n- Clothing more traditional again, preppie looks popular, hair shorter.\n\n- Grade inflation continued with many more students expecting A's, courses became easier. The \"best\" college became a concern for many whatever the \"best\" college meant to someone. \n\n1997: Gaming and other distractions dragged down literacy as reading declined, students seemed less focused, had shorter attention spans, focus still on material success but with some idealism about the world (thank goodness). Students had fun in private, and in public seemed increasingly stressed about college and life. Students still sociable (no cell phones) and willing to talk, looked at you in the hallway. \n\n- Clothing back to normal but much less colorful and creative than in the '70s, frankly boring. \n\n- Students focused much more intently on high grades, many more high grades now being given, A's became typical in many courses which had become much easier than ever before, more joke courses with light requirements, tremendous grade inflation clear throughout the curriculum, intense focus on getting into a top college as the route to success. \n\n2007: Students insanely focused on high grades and good colleges (whatever \"good\" colleges are). Obsession with gaming and other technological amusements increased, cell phones became a constant obsession with most students as casual chats in the hallway nearly disappeared. Students less sociable, did not even look at you in the hallway any more. Students willing to work hard, knowledgeable about the world, but not much interested in other peoples and cultures as focus turned toward themselves. \n\n- Clothing standard and dull\n\n- Grade inflation continued to increase with some courses now giving only A's, workload issues grew as schools worried about \"stress,\" \"overwork\" even though it had never been easier to do well in school, college focus dramatically grew with students entirely obsessed with getting into top colleges. \n\n2007: College, grades, college, grades. No joy left. Students continued to be very pleasant, but had little social concern other than vague generalized \"rights,\" awareness of the world, occasional campaigns to fix world problems (which never worked) always fizzled out before they made any progress. Much more concern over being warned in class about difficult discussions and images so they could prepare themselves (ie. far less resiliency than past students), much greater sensitivity over every possible gender and race issue, greater resentment if you did not see them as \"special\" due to their inherent characteristics. \n\n- Clothing boring and standardized\n\n- Grades at least half A's. To not get an A now seen as a \"problem\" to be talked about with the teacher.  College obsession reached its peak with nearly every student obsessed from grade 7 onward with getting into a top college. No joy in high school since no time for fun.

But the really strange thing is they just don't seem curious.  Maybe they are so bombarded with information they don't need to be?  Where kids before would ask lots of questions, want to know and find out things, the 2017ers just seem like flat-liners who could care less.  Content knowledge has been watered down because \"they can just google it\", but they don't!  If I had had google at their age, I would have been in heaven.  2017ers can literally find out anything in the world they want to know at the touch of a few buttons, and they just can't be bothered.

Still teach.  \n1997 - High school kids fall into distinct categories as do the course titles:  college bound and not college bound - which is perfectly okay with parents and kids.  Lots of electives for kids to explore their strengths and passions.  Only college bound kids take standardized tests and these kids are confident, creative, and inquisitive.  Non college bound kids are chill, too, and have confidence that their skills and work ethic will land them a decent middle class life.  Kids aren't very inclusive or accepting of differences.  \n2007 - Budget cuts to education = loss of electives, arts, and music.  New standardized testing requirements begin and all kids regularly sit for hours taking tests that simply beat them down.  An \"all kids are college bound\" mentality is the norm.  Kids are unprepared and when they earn average grades in challenging classes, the kids feel stupid and complain to parents.... who decide it's the fault of the overpaid, underworked teacher. Every kid is going to be a doctor - even the ones who can't pass chemistry.   Kids are more inclusive, but online bullying becomes a huge distraction.  \n2017 - Still no electives as they are expensive to run.  Instead students are pushed out into early college and online courses.  The class of 2017 knows nothing other than the regular and systematic beating down of standardized tests.  Because a gradebook app immediately gives them a notification (green arrow up or a red arrow down) when grades are entered, they are obsessed with grades.  They see little correlation between grades and learning.  They haven't been asked to be creative or inquisitive without technology in years and when challenged to do so now, they become frustrated and more than ever...they feel stupid.  They fear failure and student debt and while they want to go to college and become doctors, they are afraid to verbalize this dream.  Kids are much nicer to each other and way more inclusive.  ",

I'll usually just give them pushups or have them sit on the side, but I guess that's just too much for some parents to handle.

In the nineties, pagers were all the rage and the internet was relatively new to the masses and something you did sitting down at a computer (and excruciatingly slow). So as a teenager we spent a lot of time hanging out with each other one on one with an absence of technology. Sometimes we'd father to play video games, but multiplayer was limited to a local network or split screen. Most commonly we'd just take turns. But I'd argue, technology was not something we spent a lot of time on, but rather dabbled with. \n\n2007 was at the beginning of the smartphone revolution. Many (maybe most) students at this point have cell phones. Social media, youtube were coming of age. And that has changed students a lot, in my opinion. I used to get annoyed/borderline angry when I saw a group of people at dinner all on their phones. \n\n2017. Social media is rampant. A lot of studies have correlated increasing usage of social media with social disconnectedness and even depression. It is as if the creation of virtual social circles has actually created less personal social cohesion.  So it's important to put your phone down and go just hang out more, rather than less. \n\nYou'll hear, back in my day kids (fill in the blank). And it's for the most part horse shit. Kids are kids. Teens are teens. Some are put together. Some have huge obstacles to overcome. \n\nProgress that has been made. It seems to me that young people are much more tolerant of other people's sexual orientation, culture and religion compared when I was a kid. I don't know anyone from my 700+ high school that was out of the closet or identified as anything other than Christian publicly. I never thought I would see gay marriage happen, or pot legalized for that matter. And now the focus on transgender issues is at society's forefront. These are great steps that can not be over looked and discounted. \n\nSo back in my day, kids played outside and with each other teaching kids them healthy social relationships. But people that weren't the \"norm\" were silenced. \n\nThese rascals today spend too much god damn time on their phones but live in a more accepting society. Oh yeah, and have dank memes. ",

We would bike with out friends to a creek and hang out until 1 A.M.\" - (my dad) \n\nI bring up this example because it is so drastically different nowadays. Kids back in the 70s - 90s had much more independence than they do now. If i want to go out, i have to tell my parents where I am going, who with, and when I'll be back. Part of the reason for this is the perceived danger of modern times. Many adults believe their generation was much safer than ours is, despite research indicating exactly the opposite. (Probably because of the media's coverage of everything bad that goes on.) \n\nAnyway, my point is that kids today never had the independence they needed to succeed in life.

Anxiety, depression, extreme stress, whatever it is. And the peers that they talk to about it? It takes a toll on us as well. I'm 17, but I've been the primary shoulder to lean on for 3-4 of those close friends. It's so fucking hard. I'm not a counsellor, but I try to make things better. I try to give advice. It's not ever enough and it makes me feel so inadequate. My former best friend almost drowned himself and I had to get my mom to drive me to his house to make sure he wasn't dead.\n\nI haven't given up but I lay awake in bed some nights trying to resist the temptation to self harm with some of my pocket knives. Some days I'm on top of the world in the morning... by nighttime I'm just trying to rebuild my confidence for the next day. Some days I just fake my confidence. It can work, but it's not healthy.\n\nMy sample size is too small, but I've been talking with my parents about what makes students today different from they used to be. Failure is taboo. Everything gets a \"good job\" even if it's shit. We don't know how to organize our lives and live in a positive and productive way all too often. I can tell you all about the human body, cells, organic chem, how a lens works, various political systems and leaders of history and theory. What I can't tell you is how to effectively manage my time. I don't know how to do taxes. I don't know how to be a practical adult. I have way too much academic knowledge and not enough practical knowledge.\n\nI'm even one of the people who's actively working on bettering myself as a person and my practical skills. I can honestly say I think a lot of people in my graduating class are woefully underprepared for living away from home and managing time and assignments. But pretty much all of us are going to Uni/College anyways.\n\nThere's something fundamentally wrong with how we are being raised. And the school system doesn't correct that.",

Remember the class of '17 was born in 1999... adults are phone slaves as much as anyone.\n\nI'm sure most folks have seen the scene in any grocery store where a kid is glued to his parents hip trying to convince them to give them his tablet/phone to play with. It's an easy way to corral the kiddos, but I hate seeing it because the biggest part of 'play' is interacting and modeling with the world around them. That said, I don't think it's all that different than plopping kids in front of the TV was for kids in 1997 or even 2007. If you think about it further, I suppose a tablet/phone *IS* their world, so it's beneficial for them to be \"digital natives\"",

Our school was an Augustinian Catholic school, basically straight out of the movies. The student body wasn't very religious, but the administration was super Catholic and *very* straight-laced. As part of the school curriculum, every senior has to do a thesis that's basically like a lower-level version of a master's thesis or something. Coincidentally, there were 95 of us in my senior class. So, my friends had the idea of having everyone print out an extra copy of their thesis so they could \"nail\" (just using sticky tack, no actual damage) the 95 Theses to the door of the school chapel.\n\nEDIT: (In case anyone doesn't get it, Martin Luther nailing his 95 Theses to the door of Wittenburg chapel is what started the Protestant Reformation, and some Catholics are still a tad salty about it)\n\nEDIT 2: For those wondering why our administration decided to crack down so hard on senior pranks, the Class of 2013 thought it would be hilarious to remove the license plates from every non-senior car in the parking lot and put them all in a giant pile for everyone to sort out later. Which, IIRC, is highly illegal. So you can understand why they were a bit touchy about the subject.",

I think this was the last week of school, so most of the senior class members had entirely finished and weren't coming to school regardless.\n\nThese guys drove their trucks up on one side of the school and went to town, breaking around 25 windows and 6 doors. The estimated cost of the damage was somewhere around $30,000 dollars, from a news report I read.\n\nThe best part, though, is how the police caught them. See, one of them somehow got a deep cut on his arm from the shattered glass, and then tried to cauterize the wound with his lighter. As I recall, the police found this lighter at the crime scene, so all that they had to do was call a few local ERs asking if anyone with a wound matching that description had come in.

I was in college, was on their health insurance,  drove their car, ect. The hospital informed me that I'm an adult and that I had to call them, but since I was concussed, I wasn't allowed to get up and be able to call them. The hospital did call my father's office (on a Sunday), becasue that was the emergency contact number on my health insurance... my mom was livid when I finally called her about 12 hours afterwords, but the hospital just told her I fell skiing but couldn't tell her my injuries. Since then I got a Health Care rep. signed by her and my attorney. I recommend this, since I got married my wife is now authorized to talk to doctors if I'm unconscious from getting gnarly air at a mountain and I don't stick the landing... \n\n\nEDIT: I signed the docs giving my wife authority to speak to doctors. [Here's the form from the State of CT](http://ct.gov/ag/lib/ag/health/advancedirectiveappointmentofhealthcarerep.pdf) I work in law and do this all the time. Please feel free to ask questions. It's also sometimes call a living will or DNR. You can always modify it as well. \n\n\n2nd EDIT: Since everyone on Reddit watched three episodes of Law and Order and are now expert elder law attorneys, a Do Not Resuscitate and Health Care Rep are two separate documents. BUT a Living Will can have both, at least in my state. Please for the love of god click the link and you will see that the document is a Health Care Agreement that contains language about life support issued by the State of Connecticut. \n>make the decision to provide, withhold or withdraw life support systems\n\nArgue with each other if that is a DNR...",

A new bag is literally 6 ft away, but that's apparently 10 seconds of effort they don't have. Apparently whoever runs the dishwasher (75% of the time me) is responsible for emptying it, same goes for stuff on the dry rack. Instead of putting anything back a stack will just pile up. Apparently our dishwasher is also \"broken\" because it can't removed food that's been dried onto a plate for 4 days and not rinsed at all. My one roommate still messes up making pasta half the time and his diet generally consists of premade salad, pop tarts, and protein bars. And I have to go through the fridge every 2-3 weeks and throw out a bunch of stuff before things start to wreak or just make a mess.\n\nFood wise, stories from my Dad aren't too different though. When he was single with a couple roommates they pretty much bought food all the time. Anything they cooked was pretty basic (eggs, pasta). However, they all agreed a clean apartment is nice and had the 5 minutes a day to spare to keep it clean. Now that 5 minutes is time for Overwatch or Netflix.",

When I was an undergraduate, there were 2-300-person lectures. When I first started teaching, same. That hasn't changed, and when I wrote my post, I was speaking more to the smaller classes I teach which range from 5 people (graduate and upper-level seminars) to 35 people or so (some 100-level and most 200- and 300-level courses).

I actually stopped while driving past it and made my wife walk with me to look and take pics. \n\nEdit: Guys, I looked and I can't find the pics. I'll have to see if my wife had them on her phone. \n\nEdit edit: it's Mechanicville. Southeast corner of Saratoga county. There is a lot of railroad history here, Boston & Maine's old rail yard was recently rebuilt and relocated about a mile west of where it was originally located. And the old Mechanicville hydro power plant, which is a dam on the Hudson a few miles south of the main town that originally served DC power to the old GE plant in Schenectady about 20 miles away. The dam is now owned by National Grid and is still functional, though for obvious reasons now serves AC power.  \n\nEdit edit edit: [Fuckers, you had me ~~monologuing~~ go on a tangent!!](https://imgur.com/WdxVrKn)  ",

    "body": "I saw this on a thread a month or so ago. It is a pretty good summary of whats going on. \n\n> If you look at public high school education, we designed a system for the 50's. A person who wasn't \"college material\" would take easier classes, get a high school diploma, and work in the coal mine or factory. These jobs offered respectable wages and often union protection, so a person in those days could still live a comfortable life by the standards of that time period. If you went to college, it was pretty cheap (compared to today) so although it was a strain on some families, the possibility of your parents paying for it or working a job through college to pay for it was much higher.\nFast forward to today. Due to automation and a shifting economy, a lot of those unskilled labor jobs are gone. The response, then, by the population that isn't \"college material\" is to go to college. This has led to a supply and demand boom for colleges who have jacked up tuition prices (well past the pace of inflation) while simultaneously devaluing a college diploma. If everyone has a BS, then having one isn't special. Many jobs that didn't require a college degree in 50's now do. With the tuition rising but salaries not, the return on investment is drastically shrinking for a college diploma. If you don't get a diploma, however, your earning potential is significantly lower, so everyone still goes to college even though now it causes most people to go into extreme debt.\nAdditionally, with the devaluation of a standard BS degree, many people now feel pressure to get graduate degrees in order to differentiate themselves. If you want to look special on a resume, you need something extra to put you over the top. As a result, many individuals are getting Masters degrees when they wouldn't have needed it in the past, once again devaluing those degrees.",

I got a degree in philosophy because it helped me understand some of the struggles I was having with self-purpose and self-esteem.  I learned how to lead discussions, research, do technical writing, and I taught myself how to program in my off time.  I graduated with a philosophy degree and sociology minor, and went on to work for an aerospace engineering company doing software development on a launch vehicle simulation suite.  Seems like everything worked out, right?  Sort of.\n\nThe whole mentality of \"do something different, challenge the status quo!\" is such a double edged sword with older generations (from personal experience).  I've been laughed out of interviews when I tell them I have a philosophy degree, regardless of how much industry experience doing software development I have.  From my personal experience, doing something different is ridiculed.  Want to major in anything except a STEM field?  You're immediately seen as a hippy who lives on their parents dime and doesn't contribute anything to society.  It's unbelievably demeaning, and I can completely understand why high school students and even college students are unwilling to try something new, because every other turn I've come to has been faced with ridicule and laughter.  \n\nWe also live in a time of automation that is just beginning, but moving at an unbelievably quick pace that NOBODY knows how to cope with, not even older generations.  Why should I take a risk with my education when my resume is seen by an automated system that checks if I have the correct buzzwords written down?  The computer system evaluating my abilities doesn't care about hiring somebody fresh and new who has taken risks, they care about hiring somebody who meets the cookie cutter employment requirements and will blend in unnoticed to keep things running as close as possible to the same way operations have always been run.  What self confidence is there to being seen as a number in almost all aspects of industry?\n\nSo you might say, yes, there's risks in everything!  I took risks when I was younger, and sometimes they work out and sometimes they don't!  That's life!\n\nMy response is that when you were taking risks, you didn't have 75-100k college debt that doesn't go away even through bankruptcy.  My response is that you don't have to worry about the fact that there will be no social security in place when you're 80 and still working because \"helping the poor\" is always shit upon as a communist mentality.  My response is that you're not STARTING a career worrying about whether automation will make all that debt and all that training and all that time moot when it can be done 12x more efficiently by a robot.\n\nMy generation is on the precipice of so many social and economic problems it's unbelievable.  The older generation seems to have just written it all off as \"somebody else will have to fix it, not me.  Hey millenials!  Start taking risks and fix the problems we created!\"  When all we want to do is live the life that all older people have told us is possible through their own experience.  The problem is that the perfect economic life with the picket fence and owning a house is becoming close to impossible.  It's demoralizing to be entering into a workforce seeing the problems that are facing your generation and no progress or assistance provided by older generations.\n\nSo yes, we are afraid to take risks, but it's only because there are seemingly no rewards to the risks that you take.\n\nThis was a long rant, definitely not aimed at you, just aimed at the world in general.  Hopefully it sheds some light.\n\n",
