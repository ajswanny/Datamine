(Just by following them while on the phone with the police...not by kicking their ass or pulling my own gun. They were caught withing 4 minutes though because I chased them.) Anyway I was on the morning after a first date that already went well and we went to a corn maze on the way to get breakfast. As we were walking back towards my car this woman with some kids called my name. It was the D.A who prosecuted the robbers. She called me over and said she wanted to introduce me to her husband . She told him that I was the guy who chased armed robbers on foot and got them arrested. They had at some point found out my name so the FBI had gotten involved because of threats (that never went anywhere). Said I was so brave and such a good witness etc. The girl I was with asked me if I had set that up it was so good! I saved the voice mail from the FBI (cause it was awesome) and still had her card in my wallet. Still together with the girl and it's been 4 years! first time my tax money helped me get a girlfriend. \nEdit: the story link \nhttps://www.justice.gov/usao-ri/pr/fall-river-man-sentenced-22-years-federal-prison-armed-robbery-west-greenwich-ri-bank\n\n",

I'm sick as a dog and tagging along with a friend. One of the tables near the bar actually had a chessboard on the surface, and a dude was setting up a game while the bands were switching out. Wound up sitting down and playing a game with him; got my ass beat, but super friendly guy, gave me some pointers. Made sure to ask if I was staying for his band's show. Turns out he's the lead singer! Show was pretty good, too. Still went home sick partway through, though, was just feeling too shitty.\n\nCut to a month later, date #2 with a cute scenester chick. Same band is playing! I relay to my date that \"Hey, I know this band. That dude beat me in chess.\" She is, as it turns out, a massive fan. \"Oh my god, I'd be super flustered. What did you guys talk about?\" etc.\n\nAfter they get offstage, singer dude is actually in the crowd to watch the next band. Date is like \"OMG he's just hanging out!\"\n\nMe: \"Wanna say hi?\"\n\n\"Oh god no I don't wanna bother him!\"\n\n\"Oh, what? It's cool.\"\n\nWalk up to him. \"Hey dude, I dunno if you remember me, but I was the dude you played at chess back at the Green Room when I was super sick?\"\n\nInstantly: \"Oh shit, man, yeah! What's up? Did you wind up staying for the whole show?\"\n\n\"I honestly didn't man, I felt like crap. But! I told <date's name> about it and now we're back to actually go through the whole show for real now that I don't feel like ass.\"\n\n\"Oh, that's awesome! Thanks so much for coming back!\" We continued chatting for a bit, and he signed her T-Shirt and then made us promise to come see them again next time they were in town.\n\nI got *so* laid that night, so, thanks singer dude! Good lookin' out!",

A hot friend is a huge asset, if she's truly your friend. Keep her around, and ask her to wingman for you. Girls love that shit!\n\nI had a friend, really sexy \"hottest girl in town\", exotic looking model type, close to a 10 as you'd see in real life, friends for years. She started wingmanning for me and it worked. It worked too damned well, I had girls approaching ME and shit. That girl literally got me laid multiple times. And you know what? I eventually slept with her, too. If u get friendzoned cherish that shit and nurture the friendship because it's golden. Rant over",

Surprisingly, she actually became a good side character when her story arc diminished.\n\nSecond is how they treated Andy. What they did to his character made no goddamn sense. He just started being a dick which was completely out of character from someone that had been on the show for so long. He went through so many seasons of chasing Erin and then just throws it away for nothing. Thought that was bad writing. \n\nThe rest was pretty good though.\n",
