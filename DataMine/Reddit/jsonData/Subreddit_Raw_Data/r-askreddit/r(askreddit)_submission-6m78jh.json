    "body": "I'm a pilot. I fly smaller aircraft than most commercial airliners (So think Cessna's, Learjets, 6 to 30 seaters type of aircraft).\n\nOne similarity I have noticed between the smaller aircraft I fly and large commercial aircraft is passengers behaviour when the plane hits the gate is exactly the same. The minute the engines spool down, they are up and ready to get off.\n\nI've come to form the opinion that this phenomenon is actually a conditioned response by people. Indeed my co-pilot and I where discussing this once during a flight and we decided it is probably something more than just having been sat down for a number of hours or to get off the plane.\n\nI have sometimes considered the theory that it's some form of deep survival response in humans. When we get on a commercial aircraft, we are essentially putting our lives in the hands of two people and a collective of parts and components engineered to work together in an environment man was never genetically designed to be. My theory is that after you land, you subconsciously have a relief mechanism that says \"Thank god that worked out\" (Even if your not scared of flying) that manifests itself as a desire to get out of your seat, get your stuff and get off, even when there are people ahead of you.\n\nI also believe its the same reason people start lining up before their boarding class is even called, even though the seating is pre-allocated. It's the same subconscious desire to get it over and done with. The quicker your on, the quicker it's over.\n\nEdit: Thought I would add this, as so many of you are mentioning it. There's probably something to the \"I want to get my carry on in the overhead lockers before they get full\" argument for people queuing to board the aircraft before they are called. There is debate in the industry at the moment about becoming super strict on hand baggage size and/or forcing you to check anything bigger than a laptop bag because the cramming of the overhead lockers is leading to longer boarding times and starting to become an issue for carriers with push back of the aircraft.",

Nope, sorry. \"I asked you twice to size or check your bag and you refused. Please stand aside.\" She's now trying to shove her bag into the sizer, clearly failing since it was too big and having a fit.

In fact, each row getting up into the aisle is what always prevents people from skipping; it's only possible to filter out row by row. I only ever see people taking turns and filing out in row order.

Please, get up and get your shit together so you can file out.\n\nEdit: If I'm in the window, I usually just chill on my phone till everyone leaves because I can't hold anyone back by doing so.

This is valuable for celebrities. I doubt anyone else actually pays for first class tickets.\n\nBusiness is great though. Not just because of the on flight experience, but also the lounge access and priority check-in and boarding. It is great to not feel like cattle when flying. Emirates and Singapore are my favorite too! Especially love the Singapore airport. ",
