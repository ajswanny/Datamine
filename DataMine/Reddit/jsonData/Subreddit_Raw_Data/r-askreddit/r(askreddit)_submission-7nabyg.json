Turns out it was the only restaurant she'd been to, other than fast food from time to time. A few months later she was with us at an Italian place that was slightly upscale. She didn't know how to order, so my mom did it for her. For dessert, she asked for cherry cheesecake and then whispered to me that she'd just scrape the cherries off. I flagged down the server and had them change it to plain cheesecake. \n\nI felt so sorry for her because she was just uncomfortable.

I always knew that there were people who were \"less fortunate,\" but my first year of teaching has been a real eye-opener. \n\n5-7 kids sit in my room during lunch every day. I noticed that one student either didn't eat or had a Coke and hot Cheetos. I learned that he only sometimes had lunch money and if he did, it was only $2-$3.\n\nDuring December, after the first snow of the year, almost 1/3 of my students didn't have enough (if any) warm clothes. And of this third, most walk 1+ miles to and from school.\n\nMany don't have the money for school supplies, let alone lab fees. (Only some classes have lab fees. Mine don't.)\n\nI bought big boxes of granola bars and paper, binders, etc. to give to the kids whenever they need, but as a fresh from college 22 year old with $45,000 in debt, there's only so much I can do. It breaks my heart every day, but I hope being a good teacher and mentor helps them in ways that money can't. \n\nEdit: I can't tell you how much your support means to me.

    "body": "This will go no where, but I have to get it off my chest.\n\nPoverty is one thing, and it\u2019s hard - so hard - to grow up knowing your poor.\n\nPoverty is watching your parents have knock-down, drag-out fights because mom went over her $10/week grocery budget by two dollars because the grocery store wouldn\u2019t honor both the competitor price match and the manufacturer\u2019s coupon. \n\nPoverty is not even mentioning to your parents you have a field trip coming up because that $2 bus fare money isn\u2019t happening.\n\nPoverty is - at the age of eight and in the third grade - coming home from school and having to babysit your three younger sisters aged five, three and two, for three hours between one parent leaving for work and the other arriving home. It\u2019s making sure that you feed everyone, get them cleaned up for bed, clean the house from the day - a house you didn\u2019t mess because you were at school - do the laundry from the previous day, get them in their pjs and ready for bed.\n\nPoverty is when a younger sister gets seriously injured and is screaming in pain, your mother has to call three separate people to get a ride to the ER. And then she laments to your ten-year-old self that she doesn\u2019t know how she\u2019s going to afford the surgery. Then when your stepfather gets home (you were left alone for six hours with the other two sisters) and you tell him we\u2019re your mom and sister are he screams at you, as if you could have prevented the injury, convinced your mother it was negligible, or miraculously healed your sister.\n\nAnd more than all that, what makes poverty even worse, is the utter **shame** that is wrapped up in it. My stepfather was too proud to accept any government assistance or even private charity. When he and my mother married, he forced her off WIC and food stamps and told our church, who was giving us a bag of groceries a week, that we didn\u2019t need it anymore. We weren\u2019t allowed to sign up for free school meals. He barely tolerated my aunts and uncles giving my mom my cousins\u2019 hand-me-downs. We never had friends over because we lived so bare bones and we had nothing to offer to share.  \n\nOnce a teacher took me to see a presentation from Jane Goodall. My mom signed the permission slip because there was no cost involved. After it happened I was over the moon, talking about how amazing it was to meet her. My stepfather asked my mother where she got the money for the trip and screamed at her for hours until she finally convinced him it didn\u2019t cost anything. The next day he went down to the school and forced the teacher to admit that the trip cost fifteen dollars, but that she covered for me. He gave her the fifteen dollars back and then took it out of my hide for months afterwards. It was the first and last field trip I took until I got my own job and paid for my own trips.\n\nPoverty is more than money. It\u2019s the psychological and social damage of a family too stressed to function well. My stepfather grew up in poverty and was permanently affected by it. He never learned the healthy patterns of caring and nurturing. The stress of poverty and his abuse cause my upper-middle-class-raised mother to sink to his level and conform to his way of thinking. \n\nEdit: thanks to everyone who replied and wished me the best! I tried to respond to everyone who seemed like they had a question, but if I missed someone let me know. I\u2019d like to encourage everyone to read through, since I wrote more on my theory of why this happened to my family and how I managed to survive it. Also, an update someone requested about where my family is now.\n\nAnyone who is struggling with similar situations, I wrote [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/7nabyg/people_who_grew_up_middleupper_class_what_did_you/ds23jal/) on some resources that helped me. I also want to shout out to /r/raisedbynarcissists here on Reddit. There were lots of skills I learned from people who post and they gave me the courage to go No-Contact with my parents last year.\n\nFinally, to the two people who gilded me, thank you very much. I hope everyone has a safe, happy and healthy New Year!",

    "body": "I'll state the opposite perspective.  There were brief times in my childhood, during which I was hungry.  There just wasn't any food, or if there was anything it was like crackers and stale cereal and stuff.  I remember watching a Pizza Hut commercial on TV and thinking how amazing that would be.  And this was real hunger.  Very brief periods at the end of the month, while my single (and disorganized) mother was waiting for payday, after which she would make ONE trip to the grocery store every month.\n\nThen, as an adult, right when I got out of the military, I had a hard time getting fully on my feet, and I experienced some longer stretches of hunger (no more than 2 or 3 days, but that's a very long time when you're hungry).  Somehow, I always managed to have a roof over my head, but it was close.\n\nThen on to my family:  My kids are 21 and 17.  Within a month they'll be 22 and 18 (adults, technically). They have never known true hunger.  Anytime they were hungry, food was available to them.  Pretty much whatever food they wanted.  If they ever wanted more, there was more.  Whether at a restaurant, at a baseball game, at a mall, or a drive-thru on the road.\n\nThey are not in a position to appreciate how proud I am of that accomplishment.  I don't know if they will ever know true hunger.  To some degree, that is up to them.  \n\nI assume a lot of middle-class (and higher) people do not realize that true hunger exists.   Kids who go to school hungry nearly every day.  Kids who cannot focus on school, because they have so little at home.\n\n**Edit**: *Before this blew up, I posted a reply saying that I felt a little guilty having posted it, because I know that there are people who had childhoods of extended hunger, and even worse things, like extended abuse of all sorts, and situations way worse than mine.*\n\n*I also left something out about my own family.  Yes, I'm proud that I have been able to provide for my family.  But I may have accidentally made it sound like a struggle or a sacrifice.  The truth is that I have a great career and earn a nice living.  One side effect of that is that I don't have to struggle to buy food like my mother did.  I'm able to buy food more like my Grandmother did.  Probably even less budget-conscious than that.*\n\n*So on this New Years night, as I see so many people patting me on the back for providing for my kids,  I again feel guilty.  There are lots of hungry people out there, and also lots of people out there providing for their families under much more limited circumstances than mine.  Just wanted to provide a little more context.*\n\n*Having said all that, there were Thanksgivings long ago, when my kids were very young, when Thanksgiving dinner was bought with a check that sometimes didn't clear the first time.  So I know the struggle.  We just haven't struggled that way in a long time.  And my kids never knew about it.  That's what I'm proud of... that my kids have never had to be hungry.  Just to come full circle back to my original point.*",

    "body": "Even though I'm from a rich country (Saudi Arabia), my father lived in a time before oil where it was a rare occasion that he had breakfast at school. He would see other kids having breakfast and not be able to do anything. He always wanted to have a falafel sandwich at school and was only able to afford it when he was in junior high school! He didn't have dinner on so many nights either. They were able to eat a proper meal only every once in a while, and meat (usually lamb) was a luxurious rarity.\n\nHe eventually finished school and worked so hard to get a job, where he fed all his brothers and sisters, his parents, paid his father's debt and bought a car and built a house. He worked so hard in his life, steadily growing in his job until it was a high paying one, to provide for us and make sure that we didn't live like he did. I would say we were upper middle class. \n\nEven when he retired from his government job, he got another private sector job and worked until he died 6 months ago, at the age of 75.\n\nLooking back at my childhood as I grow older (I'm 32 now and a father myself), I can only imagine how tough it was for him and how much he sacrificed for us.

Not super broke, but comfortable enough that I can't give too many legit complaints (At least about that aspect).\n\nI ended up with a girl who came from a very well-off family, at least financially.  Her grandpa made it huge with some airliner, and lived frugally himself, but basically gave her every goddamn thing she wanted, and bailed her out of every stupid ass scenario she could get herself into.\n\nTo make a long, shitty story short, she stabbed me in the back, and cost me a goddamn mountain of time and money.  Her grandpa of course, bailed her the fuck out of legal costs, finding a new home, car payments, anything to keep her from having to face any sort of problems for what she later referred to as \"The fuckup of her life\".  Fast forward 7 years, I'm doing alright financially, and she contacts me out of the blue.\n\nTurns out she had a fucking revelation and reality check she badly needed.  Her grandpa had cut her off after the bullshit between me and her - the legal costs and her car were the LAST thing he did for her, and he didn't even let her come back to live in his spare room.  She was out on her ass, pregnant (With someone else's kid), and not a fucking clue what to do.  At this point, she was now living with her kid and someone else as a roommate, and trying to figure out what to do for school at 31 years old after dropping out of med school while she was with me (Didn't know she did that at the time, another tally in the list of stupid choices).\n\nThis reconnection wasn't a \"Please take me back\" kind of thing, but after living in shit for 7 years, she realized how badly she fucked up, and how much I had actually done for her, and put on the line.  She was a hardline Catholic conservative when I knew her before, and she always thought that \"Poor people are poor because they're lazy\".  She came back with a pretty different mindset.",

    "body": "I'm late, but figured I'd contribute. \n\n\nFor reference, I grew up wealthy but due to family circumstances had to cut ties this year. I'm 19. \n\n\n1. **Travel costs money, and it adds up fast.** And I don't mean, like, travel travel. I mean using the metro. People are often shocked when they invite me over and they find out I walked all the way. $2.75 adds up. My rule is usually no public transport for anything a mile away, but I've walked much more than that at times. \n\n\n2. **Cold winters suck.** I used to not like winter, but hey, at least I had a big coat. I don't own one now, and I avoid going outside because of it. Literally, I just don't go outside unless I absolutely have to. Coupled with me not using the metro, it's a miserable time out there. \n\n\n3. **People can have literally no money.** I used to think broke was not having much money, but broke can be $0, or less. I didn't realize that until I was there. \n\n\n4. **You can not have the money to advance yourself.** Interview clothes. Metrocard money to go to interviews. If you're having a rough time, you might not have spent enough time networking to have good references. \n\n\n5.  **College textbook prices are evil and mean a lot more when you're poor.** I had to drop out of a class because I couldn't afford the book prices and I had to go a long time without doing the reading in a couple of classes because I didn't have the money. And it's a lot harder to do well in classes when you have to work or you're freaking out about being homeless. Or when you have a mental illness that needs treatment and you don't have health insurance. \n\n\n6. **Socially, it's a nightmare.** I can't do anything with anyone. I have to turn most things down unless they're free, and even then free usually entails going somewhere with public transportation. It gets boring. \n\n\n7. **Food prep takes time.** The cheapest thing to do is to get materials from scratch. (god bless rice and beans) So, any free time you have, you're going to spend cooking. The good news is you'll probably get good at it. It gets interesting when you're on your last ingredients and have to make a combination out of whatever random things you have. \n\n\n8. **Fuck my credit, I don't have the money.** I have medical debt sitting unpaid, and I don't give a damn right now. Fuck my credit to hell. I can't pay it. When you're wealthy everyone always lectures you on the importance of good credit, and everyone acts like needing to take out a loan or missing a payment is the worst thing in the world. It was scary for me to realize that it was not only okay to have debt, but basically necessary. \n\n\n9. **You end up stinky.** New clothes cost money. Laundry costs a lot of money. The sniff test is your best friend, and even then sometimes you're just going to have to smell. \n\n\n10.  **Your place will be dirty.** Cleaning supplies are expensive. Your time is valuable, spent either working, cooking, or stressing the fuck out over what your life has become. So you try your best, but there's only so much soap and water can do. \n\n\nEven though I got a dependency override, it's still a toss up over whether I'll be able to go to school next semester, and if I can't I'll lose housing and end up on the streets. The stress is real, and none of growing up pampered could have prepared me for it. ",

This is why a lot of people work two part time jobs.  It's cheaper for companies to have part-time employees than full-time workers who they have to give benefits to.",

I asked the teacher about it, and he told me that they were bringing all the school lunches in a separate bus. \n\nWhen lunch time rolled around, I passed out the lunches, and I was left with the children who didn\u2019t have lunch. One boy looked at me and started to panic. He asked where the school lunches were. I told him not to worry and that I\u2019d find out. As we walked towards the busses he looked at me desperately and told me that his school lunch is the only food he eats all day. I was shocked. I knew some kids rely on their school lunch; I just didn\u2019t know they were so close to me.",

We were what I'd consider middle class, but my dad was always getting the neighbors to help him build our deck, put up the shed, finish our basement... he even converted the garage to a living space and walled up the garage door. Pretty much every one of our immediate neighbor dudes was helping. And he'd help with the same sorts of projects. \n\nThe best part was that it was always a shitshow. None of these guys were pros by any means. They'd crack open a case, pull up some shit they'd printed off of a website (early 2000s), get to work, then fuck up and spend the next 12 hours unfucking something before they got it right. \n\nI always thought they did it that way because paying pros was expensive. Here's the thing: that's only partially true. But I think it was also a way for them to get together and do 'manly' shit, as lame as that might sound. They were living in cookie cutter homes, 10-15 years into 40+ hour weeks, coming home to the same shit. Not saying that family/'dad' life is shit by any means, but that was their outlet. To create and build and build something *for* each other. \n\nThe best/worst thing about this: my parents split up and sold my childhood home a few years ago. I went back and talked to my neighbors for a bit. One of them said he hated the new people that lived in my old place. Said he was talking to the guy who'd moved in, and the guy was complaining about the quality of the deck. Said something along the lines of 'whoever built this didn't know what the hell they were doing'. My old neighbor looked at him and said 'I built this! And you're goddamned right we didn't, but it's still standing 10 years later, isn't it?'",

My grandma too the whole family to Hawaii once as a way to enjoy all the money they had saved over the years before they couldn't use it anymore.

All my money.\nAt the time I was a single parent, working full time and barely surviving. We ran out of heating oil constantly cause it was around $1000 to get the tank filled so we just bought small gas cans instead of having it filled. \nWhen I said I didn't have any money to go to touristy things with them, they were disgusted with me.\nMy one cousin, who will lived at home at 30, and had her parents put her through college, give her cars, and paid for basically everything, was so disgusted with me. She told me that she had to save up for a few weeks to have spending money, by not going out a few times.\nShe didn't comprehend that $300 was all I could save and that was not by not going to the bar, it was literally by cashing in change jars.

For several of these kids it is the only food they will have access to while not in school.  \nThe food is always kept in random donated backpacks so none of the other kids know who gets it.

When they return the book they pick up the backpack and return to class.  \nThe program is entirely funded by donations and by the teachers (most of us give $2 per paycheck, or about $50 a year).

    "body": "This is the one that strikes the biggest chord with me. My dad and his brothers grew up in abject poverty in a rural town surrounded by nothing but more rural towns. They lived close enough to a college that offered two year programs and four year programs though so they walked in and asked about acceptance and stuff. They all got in and got 2 year degrees because... why stay longer? They were just gonna work at the factory up the road anyways and an Associate's could get you a good position with a few years' hard work. So they worked there. And then it left. So my dad moved to the plant an hour away and my uncle moved to a *real* city with the company who ran the factory as he'd shown a knack for industrial engineering. My other uncles just fixed cars and houses for their neighbours and started farming beef cattle since that's what their dad did growing up before he joined the service. \n\nEventually my dad impressed enough people with his work ethic and quick mind that he got moved to the national lab near where I now live when his company started working with them. Moving was a bit of a culture shock. A lot of people think that it's still rural and I suppose it is. But we're pretty close to a city. I'm sitting about thirty minutes from a state school and walking distance from a nice community college. The roads are nice, some potholes but no gravel or dirt. The busses can usually make it to everyone's house unless it's really icy. The local high school has a few retired scientists teaching and the university has some researchers who work both at the lab and at the school. I was encouraged to use my brain and constantly helped along the way because I guess everyone here knows you can leave even though there are quite a few who don't. But lots of people have contacts in other states and even other countries. People are encouraged to study abroad and leave the country for a semester and the counselors are eager to give assistance to the poor. It's just so different. I'm off to graduate school while my 50+ dad finishes a bachelor's in physics.\n\nAnd now that I'm off to graduate school I'm trying to impress on one of my cousins who likes math that a math degree is not useless if she wants that. She doesn't have to go into business if it doesn't appeal to her. I just... don't want her stuck there if she wants more. If she wants to stay then that's reasonable but if she wants out she's quick enough to get pretty far I think. And it's just hard for me to explain to people where I am now that she may not know she can leave or what to do if she does. She's used to being surrounded by people who know her by her parents and grandparents and will just open doors for her, but school counselors in that poor an area are scarce and not as educated and there aren't many academics around. Plus internet is spotty as hell and her sisters are staying home. I just want her to know she can leave and still have a net of supportive people who might even understand what she's doing if she decides to chase her dreams.\n\nAnd none of this even mentions my mom or her sister who both grew up in a bad neighbourhood in a city and never went to college because they never had school counselors who encouraged them either or even told them there were such things as scholarships...\n\nTl;dr: My family is still half stuck in that kind of ignorant poverty despite plenty of intelligence and a good work ethic. And even the half that got out mostly got out through luck.",

One easter, she worked hard to get candy and whatnot so I would wake up to something from the easter bunny. I was real happy with my basket, until we went over to her friend's house for lunch and saw my mom's friend's daughter's easter basket. It was three times the size of mine, filled with candy and stuffed rabbits and other toys and even one of those big chocolate bunnies. I started crying, totally heartbroken, convinced that the easter bunny hated me. My mom had to take me aside and explain that no, the easter bunny didnt hate me because the easter bunny wasnt real. She told me she would love to be able to get me a huge basket, but she simply couldnt afford to, and that she was sorry. It then dawned on me that for this same reason the tooth fairy gave me a quarter when my friends would get a twenty, why santa gave me one really pretty barbie instead of an n64. I wont pretend I wasnt still envious, but I did feel smart and important to be in on a big adult secret, and that was enough to stop me crying. ",

They wanted to do something nice for us and the other extended families, so they announce at Christmas dinner that instead of regular gifts they got all of us some number of days (I think it was a week) at Disney World (or Land?  Whichever is in Florida).\n\nMy Grandparents/Aunts/Uncles all thought it was amazing.  But my parents realized immediately that even with this really nice gift that probably cost a small fortune, they still couldn't afford it.  We lived in Chicago, just getting a family to Florida was more than they had.  We had a broken down car.  My Dad also didn't have the kind of job where he could just take that much time off.  We also had a dog.  We couldn't bring the dog with, and we had no money to pay someone to watch the dog.  And even if the car could make it, and someone had a friend who could watch the dog, and even if we had money for gas, getting a family of six in a car that comfortably sat 5, with luggage for an entire week, from Chicago to Florida would have been absolutely miserable.  It's like an 18 hour drive.  Just the cost of eating out on the way down and back up was too much.\n\nIt ended up causing this huge problem with the entire family.  A big trip sounds great, and it was a nice gift; but the entire rest of the family thought my parents were just dicks for not wanting to come.  And when my Dad tried to explain that they'd love to go, but couldn't afford it; everyone just thought they were asking for more money, ungrateful for the gift.  Like, my parents were just saying 'no' so that Grandpa would kick in even more money for airfare or something.\n\nWe didn't go.  My siblings were less aware of the situation, and they didn't understand why would couldn't go.  They were disappointed.  That made my parents feel like crap.  Also, that they couldn't afford to go, and on top of that, the extended family all not getting it....it was a nightmare.  Everyone was left feeling like crap, we didn't go, I don't know if my Grandparents were able to get any of the money back.\n",

Now I'm back in debt and trying to claw my way out but you're right, you don't want to be caught in the same cycle but they're also your parents. For me though, it's time I leave them to their own devices and focus on me. It's a tough choice but a choice that needs to be made regardles",

In very rural areas, each postcode may only have one house, so names don't matter and the postie can match postcodes to properties using a map if needed. In cities, numbers are essential because one postcode may cover a block of 100+ flats. In villages, even though houses are often named, they will still have a number even if not displayed and the postie will have it on their map.
