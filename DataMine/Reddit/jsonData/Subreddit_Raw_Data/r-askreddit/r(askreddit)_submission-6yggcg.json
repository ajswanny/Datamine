A lot of people think it's weird until they try it. Easily became one of our best sellers.\n\nCream cheese with sweet chilli or Sriracha is the one; add a bit of ham and some gherkins and you're golden.\n\nDon't put your tomatoes on the bread - it'll make it soggy. Protect with some leaves.\n\nSpring onions or jalape\u00f1os melted into cheese is such a game changer.\n\nIf you've got a flavoursome meat like pastrami it is sometimes worth using a more simpler bread (such as white for the simplest example) so the flavour of the meat is brought out. However if I were making a pastrami sandwich I'd use light rye over wholemeal but white bread over granary.\n\nTo spread your mayo and mustard on the bread better and more evenly rotate the slice and spread then rotate again until back to the first.\n\nCut your sandwich into triangles and be gentle - let the knife do the work. Don't put pressure into your sandwich and squish it and tear it apart.\n\nMeat on the bottom, then cheese, then salad. Exception when salads go with meat - gherkins, sometimes jalape\u00f1os, sauerkraut even.\n\nMustard with meat, Mayo with salad.\n\nTomato based sauces with cheese are great. Tomato relish, ketchup, etc.\n\nSwiss cheese with beef. Always. \n\nCinnamon and raisin bagels go well with savoury fillings.\n\nTuna and cranberry is very popular.\n\nDon't forget to pepper your salads - specifically tomatoes. ",

It sautees these veggies, adding extra flavor.\n\n-Try a line of Chipotle southwest sauce with your next order, even if you get other sauces. It's not spicy like Sriracha or buffalo, but adds a kick that pairs well with the BMT or Steak and Cheese.\n\n-The best times to get fresh bread are between the lunch and dinner rushes (1ish to 5ish). Most stores won't make bread until lunch starts, as they have to use the bread leftover from the night before, and most stores will over-make bread for dinner so they can clean the oven/proofer earlier.\n\n-Ask your sandwich artist's opinion on what you want! They've seen it all, and most are happy to share a new spin on your sandwich\n\nSource: I'm an ex-sandwich artist",

    "body": ">There is an art to the business of making sandwiches which it is given to few ever to find the time to explore in depth. It is a simple task, but the opportunities for satisfaction are many and profound: choosing the right bread, for instance. The Sandwich Maker had spent many months in daily consultation and experiment with Grarp the Baker and eventually they had created a loaf of exactly the consistency that was dense enough to slice thinly and neatly, while still being light, moist and having the best of that fine nutty flavor which best enhanced the savor of roast Perfectly Normal Beast flesh. \n\n>There was also the geometry of the slice to be refined: the precise relationships between the width and height of the slice and also its thickness which would give the proper sense of bulk and weight to the finished sandwich\u2014here again, lightness was a virtue, but so too were firmness, generosity and that promise of succulence and savor that is the hallmark of a truly intense sandwich experience. \n\n>The proper tools, of course, were crucial, and many were the days that the Sandwich Maker, when not engaged with the Baker at his oven, would spend with Strinder the Tool Maker, weighing and balancing knives, taking them to the forge and back again. Suppleness, strength, keenness of edge, length and balance were all enthusiastically debated, theories put forward, tested, refined, and many was the evening when the Sandwich Maker and the Tool Maker could be seen silhouetted against the light of the setting sun and the Tool Maker\u2019s forge making slow sweeping movements through the air, trying one knife after another, comparing the weight of this one with the balance of another, the suppleness of a third and the handle binding of a fourth. \n\n>Three knives altogether were required. First, there was the knife for the slicing of the bread: a firm, authoritative blade, which imposed a clear and defining will on a loaf. Then there was the butter-spreading knife, which was a whippy little number but still with a firm backbone to it. Early versions had been a little too whippy, but now the combination of flexibility with a core of strength was exactly right to achieve the maximum smoothness and grace of spread. \n\n>The chief among the knives, of course, was the carving knife. This was the knife that would not merely impose its will on the medium through which it moved, as did the bread knife. It must work with it, be guided by the grain of the meat, to achieve slices of the most exquisite consistency and translucency, that would slide away in filmy folds from the main hunk of meat. The Sandwich Maker would then flip each sheet with a smooth flick of the wrist onto the beautifully proportioned lower bread slice, trim it with four deft strokes and then at last perform the magic that the children of the village so longed to gather round and watch with rapt attention and wonder. With just four more dexterous flips of the knife he would assemble the trimmings into a perfectly fitting jigsaw of pieces on top of the primary slice. For every sandwich the size and shape of the trimmings were different, but the Sandwich Maker would always effortlessly and without hesitation assemble them into a pattern which fitted perfectly. A second layer of meat and a second layer of trimmings, and the main act of creation would now be accomplished. \n\n>The Sandwich Maker would pass what he had made to his assistant, who would then add a few slices of newcumber and fladish and a touch of splagberry sauce, and then apply the topmost layer of bread and cut the sandwich with a fourth and altogether plainer knife. It was not that these were not also skillful operations, but they were lesser skills to be performed by a dedicated apprentice who would one day, when the Sandwich Maker finally laid down his tools, take over from him. It was an exalted position and that apprentice, Drimple, was the envy of his fellows. There were those in the village who were happy chopping wood, those who were content carrying water, but to be the Sandwich Maker was very heaven.\n\n5:13 ",

Putting the onions with the meat helps with the flavor and brings out both meat and onion tastes. It's a small thing that just adds a little bit to the sub.\n\n2. Fluff your meat, Placing your meat flat on a sandwich is a bad idea, it taste a lot better when you fluff the meat. It should look thick. It's the different between a good and great sub. \n\n3. Fuck ranch, Don't you fucking dare put ranch on a sandwich, even god wouldn't forgive that sin. \n\n4. Seasoning is important as hell, oregano and black pepper are my go to\n\n5.

My roommate and I ended up eating paninis every day for at least one meal for months. Breakfast paninis (eggs or pb&j), lunch paninis that we'd reheat in the toaster oven at work, or for a super easy dinner. Then everyone else in the family had to have one. The only caveat is that you have to use the right bread. A stiff, dry bread is best. The bread that we buy is great for paninis and toast but not that great for regular sandwiches, so when we buy bread we have to commit to either panini bread or regular sandwich bread.",

I promise I'm not rich, I just like fresh herbs and potted plants so throwing a little money at pots and a bag of soil is worth it.\n\nAlso, I'm glad there are so many avid basil eaters/growers here! I personally have a pot each of sweet and Thai basil, along with some hill-hardy rosemary, English thyme, and a little lavender. As for why they're all alive: they live outside right now, get plenty, but not too much sun, and I water them as needed.

Hotdogs and burgers, by almost any definition, are technically sandwiches, but tend to get their own category. While structurally, they are sandwiches, the controversy over their eponymous ingredients should put them in the radical ingredient section. \n\nThe ice cream on waffles thing is way less radical than this chart makes it seem, because ice cream sandwiches are a common snack. If they didn't already exist with the name sandwich, ice cream sandwiches would be radical, but they are much more neutral than a hotdog will ever be. \n\nAlso ice cream tacos belong in the radical structure row. Saying a taco is a sandwich is just as radical as saying the same about a burrito. \n\nTl;dr: Replace the ice cream sandwich with a burger, replace the ice cream taco with the hotdog. Maybe substitute a meatball sub in for the vacant true neutral spot.",
