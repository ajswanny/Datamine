    "body": "Alright, here we go:\n\n* got a new computer and installed a bunch of stuff on it and now it's slow? That's because it's running everything which saves you about 3 seconds while killing your machine. After you install everything, you can go and click on all the settings of what these programs should do when they start up or just type in \"msconfig\" and go to startup or go to taskbar->startup (depending on OS) and disable everything you just installed. It doesn't mean they won't run anymore - they will - but it means they won't preload everytime you log in.\n* hate viruses? Me too. Create two profiles: an Administrator account with a good password and your actual account. Make sure your account is NOT an Administrator account and disable as many things as possible. That way when a virus tries to install itself, the OS will say you have no permission to install a virus (or software, or update Steam, or do anything) unless it has your explicit permission where you enter in the Administrator password. This'll protect you from 95% of all viruses not to mention annoying updates you don't really need.\n* Install Ccleaner and run checks now and then. Just be careful, their default setting clears your cookies which logs you out of all websites. Check through all the tabs including which software runs at start up (another check from the first bullet above) and what add-ons are running too. Disable anything related to Apple, Google, Adobe, etc.\n* Google what windows shortcuts do (ex: windows+e, windows+d) since there are too many to list\n* Google Word and Excel keyboard shortcuts. It'll save you a ton of time.\n* In Excel: type in 1 in a cell, then 2 in the next cell. Highlight both and move your mouse to the bottom right corner of the cell with 2 in it. See the black plus? Click and drag that over to create a range. It's pretty smart and works with formuals and dates too.\n* In Excel: if you have some data highlighted, you can right click on it and sort by color rather than data.\n* Copy/pasting into Word/Excel looks terrible? Copy/paste into Notepad then copy from Notepad to Word/Excel. Note: this will strip out all formatting but this includes things like bold, italics, etc. EDIT: Ctrl+Shift+V  also works :]\n* Pick a browser, any browser, and only use that browser to log into anything secure. Don't use that browser for anything else.\n\nSome hardware tips:\n\n* you can buy something cheap and upgrade it or you can spend some money, buy something at the top of the line, and you don't need to touch it for at least 3 years.\n* instead of a regular hard drive, get a solid state drive as your primary hard drive no matter what you get\n* if you have a CD/DVD in your CD/DVD in your player, your computer will take longer to load unless you bypass it in the setup (basically it tries to load the OS from the CD/DVD)\n* pushing and holding the power button on the laptop/desktop will always shut it off in a few seconds no matter how much your computer crashed\n* laptops: if your laptop is turning on but you don't see anything then unplug it from power, remove the battery, flip it around, find a small hole on the back that'll fit a paperclip end, push the end through and it'll hit a tiny button. Push it about 20-30 times in a row. Plug everything in and your laptop will work. Basically there's some static that's preventing the system from loading and clicking that button discharges that static.\n* that same hole exists near CD/DVD trays, poke it to eject the disk. It's a hardware switch that'll work even if there's no power to the device\n* fan running loud? It's likely dirty so open up your case (be careful if it's a laptop - go to YouTube for instructions) and use the air can to blow it out.\n* desktops: air is meant to travel from the front to the back and (for some models) up. Preserve the air flow and don't obstruct it. Don't put anything behind a desktop since that's where the exhaust usually is.\n* have pets? Don't put a desktop on the floor or their dander will get into your computer (which will get hot and create an awesome smell after a few months).\n\nGeneral tip: something doesn't work? Try to get as much info as you can including the error message. Then Google \"solved\" followed by that error message.\n\n\\#1 tip ever: presume it's a stupid problem first. For instance, monitor just stopped working? Is it video drivers? Computer died? Video card died? No, it's likely your power cord to the monitor is just slightly not connected. Always assume it's a simple hardware problem first.\n\nGood luck!",

Virtual machines (VM's) are basically running a computer inside your computer. You can do whatever you want on the VM and it will be kept separate from your actual computer. This means if you want to download something but think it might have a virus, like let's say a video from a sketchy website, you can download it on your VM. If it does have a virus you can just reset the VM and no harm will be done.\n\nEdit: I'm just going to clarify a little bit what a VM does.  It essentially lets you have two computers running at the same time on one machine. To the outside world starting a VM would just look like you turned on another computer. The ***main*** reason for having one is for software developers who might want to test running software on two different operating systems at the same time.

Here are some of my most frequently used:\n\n**Windows Key + X** is pretty good for sysadmins, use that one alot.\n\n**Windows Key + P** - Monitor control. Extend, duplicate etc.\n\n**Windows Key + E** - Insta opens explorer. Great for those shitty metro workstations.\n\n**Windows Key + R** - Pulls up Run. If you can type as fast as me this is a great way to enter a ps session or cmd prompt.\n\n**Windows Key + L** - Lock machine\n\n**Windows Key + D** - Instant flash to desktop (Windows Key + M does the same thing)\n\n**Windows Key + ,** - Sneak a cheeky peek at your desktop. Release to return to your window.\n\n**Windows Key + Tab** - This one really is great on Windows 10 because you can circumvent black screen crashes. Whilst you're in task view you can open a new desktop. Open task manager on that second desktop before debugging/troubleshooting. When your machine defaults, just WKey + Tab and go into your second desktop. Kill the process from there and you're home free.\n\n**Control + Shift + T** - In Chrome this will open your last closed tab.\n\nThere's another little trick I use a lot when programming. If you have millions of windows open and want to just focus on one, grab it by the top bar and give it a little wiggle. Everything else will minimize leaving you with that one window open.\n\nAnother one - Windows 10 is a little bitch when it comes to restarting and shutting down. If you're calling a shutdown or restart from the Start Menu your computer isn't doing it properly. They've made it skip operations and cache flushes in an attempt to make it faster. After restarting you can still be left with issues. The best thing to do is to call your shutdowns and restarts from a command prompt using : **shutdown /s /f** or **shutdown /r /f** (for a restart). This will put your machine through the correct motions and will actually restart it.\n\nYou can tell if your machine has done this 'lazy' restart by checking your uptime after a restart. If your uptime hasn't changed, Windows hasn't done shit.\n\nWindows 10 sucks, in general.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Use Page-Down. Use Ctrl + arrow keys.\n\nYou don't need to click the little Sigma symbol for AutoSum. Use Alt+=\n\nYou don't need to click on the bottom worksheet tabs to switch. Use Ctrl+PgUp / Ctrl+PgDn\n\nIf you press and release the Alt key, it brings up a different letter for each of the command tabs at the top of the window, and if you select one of them, it then gives you a letter for each of the sub-commands. Once you get used to them, you can start to perform many commonly-used functions in just a couple of key-strokes. At this point, it's become second-nature to me to just hit Alt+A+S+S in order to sort data, or Alt+H+O+R to rename a tab.\n\nWhen you get used to that stuff, it looks sooooo much more impressive and it tells anybody watching that you know what you're doing. I'm not all that great with the different formulas and available tools, but people at the office think I'm a guru because I navigate it so quickly with just the keyboard.\n\nThat being said, I'll have to look into the INDEX-MATCH stuff instead of VLOOKUP, because I've always used the latter...

Two full time guys on the phone all day for ~500 employees, with me needing to step in and help all the time as well.\n\nWe fixed it with a simple policy: *only* team leads could call IT or lodge a request for anything that wasn\u2019t an account issue (so \u201cI can\u2019t log in\u201d). First few weeks the team leads were pissed but after about a month the helpdesk had died down to mostly legitimate issues and when we checked with the leads, they had become fans of the system because it had forced all their staff to actually learn the basic shit they should know for their jobs.\n\nSee before, nobody was trying. Any issue on a computer? Call IT. Different department, fuck em, their problem. Once it became the team leads responsibility to triage issues they had a vested interest in saying \u201cwhy the fuck do you not know how to copy paste in excel, you\u2019re a fucking accountant?\u201d. It brought the laziness and complacency of their staff when it came to learning technology to their attention... and the staff now knew if they didn\u2019t put effort in they couldn\u2019t just call some helpdesk kid and make it their problem, it reflected on them to their immediate supivisor and was going to show up in their performance reviews etc.\n\nWith the spare time, we put the helpdesk to work writing really good work instruction for every common issue that could be resolved by staff, cutting down even further on issues arising.\n\nIt\u2019s an amazing system but not one I\u2019ve ever seen implemented anywhere else, cause everyone goes \u201cfuck that!\u201d and fobs it off to IT.
