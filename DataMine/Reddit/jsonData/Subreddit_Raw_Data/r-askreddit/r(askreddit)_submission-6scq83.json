It's super simple/stupid: point your camera at a book barcode, and it searches for that book on LibGen. LibGen, if you're unfamiliar, is probably the current best way to pirate ebooks. \n\nSuggested uses: you're a student? Go to your bookstore and save your $800. Even if they're out of your book, lots of schools print the barcode on the shelf tag. This is the main reason I wrote this, actually; I was the guy who hooked people up with textbooks. Got a paper book collection you want to read without toting so much dead tree? Bam. Or just go nuts in a Barnes and Noble.   \n\nEdit: wanted to mention that it works fine on Kindle Fire or similar e-reader tablets.  \n\n~~E2: Lots of people have asked how to download from their devices: [direct link](https://github.com/nfd9001/Libgen-Scan/raw/master/app-debug.apk) OR tap \"view code\", then app_debug.apk, then Desktop Version at the bottom of the page, then Download.~~\n\nE3: Latest versions [can be found here.](https://github.com/nfd9001/Libgen-Scan/releases)    ",

I usually get about 1-2 a week depending on where I go/what I do. Surveys last about 30 seconds to a minute. Sometimes you'll watch a video or something. They most commonly ask surveys about local shopping experiences so make sure to keep Location data turned on, unless you're not okay with them tracking you.

So he decided to learn how to program for iOS. One day he tells me he has an app.\n\nNow for a brief moment I had the joy of wondering what type of app my dad made. What was it that this man would dedicate himself to? Before I tell you, please know he's one of the most anal men I know. Stickler for the rules and for respect. And he never lets ANYTHING go. One time before I moved to LA I forgot to get an onion bread sliced for him - I bought the loaf but didn't have them slice it - he mentioned it on our drive rom DC to LA more than 30 times as an example of how I just don't think. \n\nOK back to the story. What app does this guy make? It's called [Trak'n'Turn](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/traknturn/id1185957021?mt=8). It's designed for you to keep track of things, and so you can know whose turn it is. He was inspired by a chit that he and his friends used to pass around to track whose turn it was to pay for lunch. Now they don't use that because they all have Trak'n'Turn. \n\nMy dad uses it when he babysits my nieces. He uses it to know the last time he watered the lawn. He uses it to keep track of the times I've called him and note the quality of the conversation.\n\nIs the GUI perfect? Nah. Is there a weird combination of too many and too few features? Yup. But dammit, good for my dad to find a way to keep on tracking as he moved past retirement age. I know damn well that years from now he'll be lording shit over me that I forgot to do that he tracked for god knows how long. And you know what? I'm cool with that.",

And seeing my \"allowed\" calory intake for the day increase because I've taken the bike to and from work is a nice motivator to get some excercise.\n\nI wholeheartedly recommend this app to anyone that wishes to lose weight. The paid version isn't a must at all for most people, but I'm thinking of upgrading to the full version soon just to support the app developers (even though I'm guessing they're actually making plenty of mony from ads).\n\nAnyways, it's nice and has been a huge help.",

I could have sat there for hours and never made that turn, but no matter how I tried to go around it, Waze just kept rerouting me back to that spot. It's very frustrating.

If you have a Google account, it's already tracking your data (if you have gmail, those little ads in gmail are targeted by keywords in your emails).\n\nIt's also about providing digital marketing feedback to marketers and verifying geolocation tracking. I work in digital marketing and Google sometimes sells-in surveys that show marketing influence on recall and interest. \n\nIf you have google maps tracking enabled, Google is already watching where you go. Many of my Google Rewards Surveys  try to verify where I exactly went (Michael's or the Best Buy next door?).\n\nSo if you're worried about Google getting the data, chances are it already has most of it. Google Rewards lets you monetize confirming it. I use it pretty religiously. Google's going to track your data either way, might as well get some play store credit off of it.",
