It was clearly intended as an identification and recognition guide, but was *far* too detailed.  It not only contained photographs and textual descriptions of various IEDs, but had details of their internal design, circuit schematics, weaknesses etc.\n\nIn short it provided a great resource for anyone who wanted to manufacture IEDs, as well as alerting the enemy to flaws and weaknesses in their existing designs.\n\nWe pointed this out to the relevant authorities and the document disappeared shortly afterwards.\n\nIt was a fascinating document and I only wish I'd kept a copy!\n",

In one study, researchers gave pregnant women doses of iodine-131. When they inevitably miscarried, they studied the women's aborted embryos in an attempt to discover at what stage, and to what extent, radioactive iodine crosses the placental barrier.\n\nIn another study, they gave 25 newborn babies (who were under 36 hours old) iodine-131, either by oral administration or through an injection, so that they could measure the amount of iodine in their thyroid glands, as iodine would go to that gland.\n\nImmediately after World War II, researchers at Vanderbilt University gave 829 pregnant mothers in Tennessee what they were told were \"vitamin drinks\" that would improve the health of their babies. The mixtures contained radioactive iron and the researchers were determining how fast the radioisotope crossed into the placenta. At least three children are known to have died from the experiments, from cancers and leukemia. Four of the women's babies died from cancers as a result of the experiments, and the women experienced rashes, bruises, anemia, hair/tooth loss, and cancer.\n\nFrom 1946 to 1953, at the Walter E. Fernald State School in Massachusetts, in an experiment sponsored by the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission and the Quaker Oats corporation, 73 mentally disabled children were fed oatmeal containing radioactive calcium and other radioisotopes, in order to track \"how nutrients were digested\". The children were not told that they were being fed radioactive chemicals; they were told by hospital staff and researchers that they were joining a \"science club\".\n\n[This is just a tiny selection.] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unethical_human_experimentation_in_the_United_States)",

The only real detail about it that has been released was its explosive yield: 10,000 megatons. Which is to say, 10 gigatons. \n\nWhen Teller briefed an advisory board of government scientists on it, [they were horrified](http://imgur.com/1ZJamtw):\n\n> Dr. Fisk said he felt the Committee could endorse [Livermore's] small weapon program. He was concerned, however, about Dr. Teller's 10,000 MT gadget and wondered what fraction of the Laboratory's effort was being expended on the Gnomon and Sundial. Mr. Whitman had been shocked by the thought of a 10,000 MT [bomb]; it would contaminate the earth.\n\nA congressional committee was secretly briefed on it. [This exchange is rather wonderful](http://imgur.com/2zWXmcy):\n\n> SENATOR JACKSON: This is a design that will end once and for all Malthus' theory of population.\n\n> DR. BRADBURY: You don't have to deliver it -- just leave it in your backyard.\n\nTo put it into perspective, the largest bomb ever detonated, the Tsar Bomba, could at its maximum yield have been 100 megatons (100,000 kilotons). The bomb detonated on Nagasaki was 20 kilotons; the largest bomb the US ever detonated, Castle Bravo, was 15 megatons (15,000 kilotons). The SUNDIAL would have been 10,000 megatons (10,000,000 kilotons), one hundred times more powerful than the Tsar Bomba, 500,000 times more powerful than the Nagasaki bomb. [It could scorch an area the size of France or Texas](https://twitter.com/wellerstein/status/641973383429795841).\n\nThe program was axed by the Eisenhower Air Force, who concluded they had no military need for such a weapon, which looked more like a \"doomsday device\" than something they could actually imagine using. I find it quite interesting (as someone who researches this stuff) that this was just a little too \"on the nose\" for them \u2014 a scientists' fascination, but not one that would work with a military doctrine that believed (rightly or wrongly) that nuclear war could be fought _and won_.\n\nTLDR;: US weapons scientists actually did consider building Dr. Strangelove-like contamination weapons of humongous proportions. \n\nSource: [my blog](http://blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/2012/09/12/in-search-of-a-bigger-boom/) :-)\n\nAdded a few links to screenshots of the documents, for the suspicious. I work on this kind of thing for a living. It's a fun job if you can get it...

The widows asked the government to release the accident reports of the crash, something they were legally entitled to in the Discovery process.  The government refused to comply, asserting national security.  This case made it all the way to the supreme court, which used the case to explicitly found the State Secrets privilege.  The Supreme Court denied the widows request, and allowed the government to withhold evidence that it claimed was vital to national security.  Years later, the accident reports were finally declassified, and there was nothing related to national security in them. The government had lied to the Court to prevent evidence from getting out that would harm its case.  \n\nAny declassified report that indicates the Government lied to oversight committees really scares me.  What the fuck are you supposed to do when the steps we take to watch the government are compromised by the government's ability to lie to itself, and citizens?  The Senate Torture Report for instance, also included findings of the CIA misrepresenting facts to oversight groups such as the United States Congress.",

He had a .22 caliber rifle with him to shoot snakes and fend off other predators, but by all accounts carried it regularly and used it for nothing else. Four US marines in ghillie suits 200 meters away apparently witnessed Hern\u00e1ndez shoot his weapon in their direction, then tracked him as he herded goats for 20 minutes before shooting and killing him. There is no indication that he ever knew they were present, and he had no connection to the drug trade. As far as I know this is the only case of US Marines killing a US citizen on US soil during peacetime. The Marines were never convicted of a crime, although Hern\u00e1ndez's family did receive a $1.9 million settlement in a wrongful death suit from the US government. I recommend the documentary on the incident (linked in the wiki).\n\nOn a personal note, I've spent a lot of time in Redford, and as a community they seem totally forgotten by the US government. Last time I was there their elementary school was closed, and students were forced to take a bus to a school 1 - 2 hours away. Many families that live there have done so for hundreds of years, and up until the mid 90s would cross the river freely to visit family who lived on the other side. They've lived there for so long that the US acquisition of the territory they live on was still contentious, since it arbitrarily split their community into two different countries. Increased border security has only served to force them to drive 30 - 45 minutes away to a border crossing to cross the river, and then drive back to visit family whose houses they can see from their kitchen windows.

Basically, the CIA and/or other US government operatives would commit acts of terrorism and conduct attacks on US soil, blame it on Cuba and then use it to get public support and justification to go to war against Cuba. Bombings, hijackings, assassinations, and acts of terror in US cities were some of the proposed methods. Even going as far as using MiG jets - painted in Cuban colors and markings - to conduct some of these attacks. Fidel Castro and his communist regime had taken up power around this time and we were hellbent on snuffing out communism anywhere it popped up. JCOS and DoD wanted to provoke war with Cuba BAD. They just needed justification to do it. Operation Northwoods wasn't the only plan they had. They came up with other plans as well.\n\nUltimately, President Kennedy rejected the Operation Northwoods proposal and removed the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in 1963. There was a rift between Kennedy and the US military leaders after this because they thought he was going soft on Cuba. \n\nWe all know what happened to Kennedy later that year. This is one of the reasons why I believe Oswald didn't act alone, or possibly wasn't even the shooter in the first place.\n\nMore-so, when you look at 9/11 and how that all played out, and then you look at Northwoods, it paints a bit of an interesting picture as well.\n\n*takes tin foil hat off*",

Lots of talk of kooky LSD experiments and psychics, not so much talk of inducing multiple personality disorder to create an unknowing manchurian candidate. The documents claim that in the mid 1950s they could trigger an alternate personality in a hypnotized subject, have them fire what they believed was a loaded gun at the doctor, then have them forget all knowledge of these events when they returned to their everyday personality. They'd have no indication of having alternate personalities, and they'd do their best to mentally avoid or explain any way discrepancies, as dissociation is part of the minds defense mechanism against itself. The worst part? Torture is the only guaranteed way to induce multiple personality disorder, but even then it's not guaranteed unless the victim is age 5 or under, before the ego is formed.\n\nYou still with me? There are recent, confirmed cases of this technique being employed by governments and cults. For an easily confirmed example, search for a Salon article called \"James Bond and the Killer Bag Lady\" regarding the assassination of a CIA asset. Note both doctors worked on MKULTRA. Now search for Doctor Donald Dudley and you'll find an AP article where he was caught programming young autistic children and teaching them to shoot.\n\nSorry I'm on mobile so if you need links or sources PM me. I have mainstream sources and docs to back it up, and many more leads if you're interested. There's also a zip file containing 10,000 MKULTRA docs released through FOIA.",

The amount of crazy casually mentioned stories you would hear: residents kept tied to the bed naked 23 hours a day, hosed down weekly as a 'shower'. Horrible abuse stories, such as the wards where catatonic or physically immobile patients (male and female) were continually raped (think of Beatrix Kiddo's experience in Kill Bill). As if it couldn't get any worst, not only was there collusion at all levels within the Administration, the children that resulted from the rapes were hidden in the foster care system. Many people were also 'disappeared' into Willowbrook by their families for a variety of reasons, from 'being wild', or drug abuse to having an interracial relationship, never to be seen again. \n\nThe person who gave Geraldo Rivera (he broke the story and became famous) access was rumored to be a mid-level Admin who tried to change the place, but found out the Administration liked it the way it was...\n\nOh yeah, the place is spiritual maelstrom of lost souls, probably the most haunted place on Staten Island. You walk by the old crematorium (of course it had a creamatorium), and you can physically feel the misery in the air. So yeah, all 40 acres are cursed. \n\nIt's now the College of Staten Island, part of City University New York. They should have a Parapsychology research lab there in my opinion. \n\n*Edit* So I seemed to cause a bit of controversy with my last two comments. Haha I don't care.  Some people can physically 'feel' this sort of negative energy, some can't. It's like trying to explain the color orange to a blind person. I've been to concentration camps in Germany (some are worst than others, the political prisoner camp in Berlin hit me like a kick in the chest) former massive battlefields in Korea, former Plantations in the American South and even Native American burial grounds that were desecrated by construction. You can feel the same thing. Misery. Some people can feel/see these lost souls, some can't. Most people who sensitive avoid places like this because it's emotionally corrosive. Places like this, even the birds avoid flying over. ",

In districts hundreds of kilometers from ground zero wooden houses were destroyed, stone ones lost their roofs, windows, doors, and radio communications were interrupted for almost one hour. One participant in the test saw a bright flash through dark goggles and felt the effects of a thermal pulse even at a distance of 270 kilometres (170 mi). The heat from the explosion could have caused third-degree burns 100 km (62 mi) away from ground zero. A shock wave was observed in the air at Dikson settlement 700 km (430 mi) away; windowpanes were partially broken to distances of 900 kilometres (560 mi).[23] Atmospheric focusing caused blast damage at even greater distances, breaking windows in Norway and Finland. Despite being detonated 4.2 km above ground, its seismic body wave magnitude was estimated at 5\u20135.25.[10][20] Sensors continued to identify the shockwaves after their third trip around the world.[11][24]  \n  \nAnd that's ~~100~~ 50 MT.

It has a government we property and Radioactive sticker on it behind glass. Quite cool. \n\nThe second thing, the engine didn't spew radioactives in any significant way. A separate hypothetical project proposed doing something to deliberately contaminate. I believe it came from a scientist that opposed nuclear weapons. \n\n\nEdit:\nOk. A follow up. Project Pluto didn't dump Fallout as it flew. That is incorrect. SLAM is the cruise middle, but in its terminal stage of flying over populated areas didn't use radiation to kill. It used its SHOCKWAVE to damage and injure since it was supersonic. When it crashed, it would spread its fuel and cause massive injury through contamination. This terrible thing was never built or even designed beyond concept. An engine was tested and that was it. \n\nProject Pluto differs from Project Rover which I described in my original post. Rover was a rocket engineer. Safe although they had fear of a critical even and breakup in the atmosphere (hence never launched). Pluto was a ramjet which heated air with a supercritical reactor. Pluto is the engine in the museum in Las Vegas. Rover (damn earlier typo) is also the type of engine modeled on Kerbal Space Program for the nuclear engine components. \n\nEdit 2: damn typo. KSP is modeled after the Rover-type of engine, not the Pluto ramjet. And Rover and NERVA shared a lot of resources and design features being both nuclear rocket engines. ",

Even without the broad reading that the claim included secrecy concerning the aircraft itself, the court found it possible that the documents' revelations \"that the mission required an 'aircraft capable of dropping bombs' and that the mission required an airplane capable of 'operating at altitudes of 20,000 feet and above'\" could have been \"seemingly insignificant pieces of information [that] would have been of keen interest to a Soviet spy fifty years ago.\"[15]",

As the years went on, more people became the target, but they were unable to know the truth. \n\nSo, upper clases with contacts who wanted a kid talked with the doctors and they will provide with newborns. Who will society believe? A loving couple or a single mother? (In spain, single motherhood was a harsh social stigma) And if their parents were poor, they will never know, because everyone covered it and there was no posible legal action or investigation.\n\nWeird thing: When all of this came out, my own mother digged through her family documents, diaries, and memories and she found that her mother (my grandma) had a baby that died after childbirth (Her mother told her that information years ago)\n.\nUnable to investigate or pursue furhter, that question pops in our family every once in a while: Do we have a lost relative, somewhere?\n\nEdited: Some Spelling and to adress some comments, there is no way to find out unless you can acces every document and registry. The government had no plans to help people, and wont do anything, because that gets int our civil war talk, and the policy on that has and will always be: That happened, it may be sad but we wont investigate things, we wont adress issues.

Someone then pointed out that the aggressive \"protesters\" were wearing the same boots as the police, and the protesters started to call them out. About that time, the police grabbed the \"aggressive protesters\" and \"arrested them\" (read: whisking them away from the crowd who was starting to suspect that they were police officers in disguise as protesters).\n\nThis protest was happening in Canada. Even \"nice\" countries like Canada pull this kind of crap.\n\nUpdate: \n\nGoogle 'Canada Montebello Protesters Provacateurs' to find videos. There's a bunch on YouTube. Trying to find one that has the best video. In the videos, you can hear the protest leader telling one of the \"protesters\" to \"put the rock down\" and also \"protester\" is pushing people.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S1nHvvkzvA\n\nHere's an article on the Wayback machine, since the CBC article is on their website is missing (original link, which is now broken: http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2007/08/23/police-montebello.html ).\n\nInternet Archive: https://web-beta.archive.org/web/20070825094339/http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2007/08/23/police-montebello.html\n\n> Quebec provincial police admitted Thursday that three of their officers disguised themselves as demonstrators during the protest at the North American leaders summit in Montebello, Quebec.\n>\n> However, the police force denied allegations its undercover officers were there on Monday to provoke the crowd and instigate violence.\n>\n> ...\n>\n> Police came under fire Tuesday, when a video surfaced on YouTube that appeared to show three plainclothes police officers at the protest with bandanas across their faces. One of the men was carrying a rock.\n>\n> In the video, protest organizers in suits order the men to put the rock down, call them police instigators and try unsuccessfully to unmask them.\n>\n> ...\n>\n> Protest organizers on Wednesday played the video for the media at a news conference in Ottawa. One of the organizers, union leader Dave Coles, explained that one reason protesters knew the men's true identities was because they were wearing the same boots as other police officers.\n>\n> ...\n>\n> Police said the three were told to monitor protesters who were not peacefully demonstrating to prevent any violent incidents, but they were called out as undercover agents when they refused to throw objects.\n\nHa ha. Such a ridiculous claim since: nobody appeared to be throwing anything, the police were standing there peacefully, and the idea that a crowd would be able to notice that a few guys *weren't* violent seems like a stretch, and the protest leader was telling one of the \"protesters\" to drop the rock, and the protest leader was asking them to leave because they appeared to be trying to instigate violence.\n\n> The Quebec provincial police will not comment any further on the affair, a spokeswoman in Montreal said.\n>\n> Quebec Justice Minister Jacques Dupuis was made aware of the news, but a spokesman from his office said he will not comment on the matter either.",

If the rebel was pregnant she was kept in jail and was killed after given birth while her baby was taken away to be adopted.

If notification was received from the early warning systems that inbound missiles had been detected, the Soviet Union's strategy was an immediate nuclear counter-attack against the United States (launch on warning), specified in the doctrine of mutual assured destruction. ... Shortly after midnight, the bunker's computers reported that one intercontinental ballistic missile was heading toward the Soviet Union from the United States. Petrov considered the detection a computer error, since a first-strike nuclear attack by the United States was likely to involve hundreds of simultaneous missile launches in order to disable any Soviet means of a counterattack. ...

So yea, probably..\n\n\"In his sophomore year at Harvard, Kaczynski participated in a personality assessment study conducted by Henry Murray, an expert on stress interviews.[citation needed] Students in Murray's study were told they would be debating personal philosophy with a fellow student.[16] Instead, they were subjected to a \"purposely brutalizing psychological experiment\".[16] During the test, students were taken into a room and connected to electrodes that monitored their physiological reactions, while facing bright lights and a one-way mirror. Each student had previously written an essay detailing their personal beliefs and aspirations: the essays were turned over to an anonymous attorney, who would enter the room and individually belittle each student based in part on the disclosures they had made. This was filmed, and students' expressions of impotent rage were played back to them several times later in the study. According to author Alston Chase, Kaczynski's records from that period suggest he was emotionally stable when the study began. Kaczynski's lawyers attributed some of his emotional instability and dislike of mind control techniques to his participation in this study.[16] Furthermore, some have suggested that this experience may have been instrumental in Kaczynski's future actions.[17][18]\"\n\n\n^^Pretty fucked for an already flighty kid who might have been on the spectrum...pretty fucked for *anyone* really..",

But they apparently were rejected by the civilian leadership and have gone undisclosed for nearly 40 years. \n\n>Whether the Joint Chiefs' plans were rejected by McNamara in the meeting is not clear. But three days later, President Kennedy told Lemnitzer directly there was virtually no possibility of ever using overt force to take Cuba, Bamford reports. Within months, Lemnitzer would be denied another term as chairman and transferred to another job. \n\n\n\nIt's just the way it's worded. \"Civilian leadership\" in this context refers to the President of the United States or his defense secretary, but likely both. The book this article cites likely goes into more detail, so I'll order the book and report back on this in a week. \n\nInterestingly, the article further states that these documents should have been destroyed along with many other similar documents, so we shouldn't even know about this. \n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilian_control_of_the_military",

For example, they would tell him to be aware of 5 men a couple blocks ahead who were behind some shipping crates.  Many situations like that.  Anyway, the team leader apparently asked the contact what kind of resolution the satellite had.  The contact told him to empty a pocket and throw its contents on the ground.  The team leader had a quarter roll he carried that he removed several quarters from and threw in the dirt.  The next message from the contact was the dollar figure of the exact amount.

Only geeks like me cared about it.    I can't recall who but I think it was Larry Niven or Jerry Pournelle maybe, wrote an article (where it was published I do not recall) speculating that if there had been a few more deaths, the public would not have lost interest so rapidly. See, it became a routine thing. The image of incredibly brave heroes doing epic things at huge risk, which is what the public adores, evaporated.  Horrible as it is to think about, had there been some tragic deaths, the larger than life public image likely would have kept their interest and thus the program going strong.  I don't recall whether he noted the Apollo 1 fire that killed three astronauts on the lunch pad, but that tragic event certainly spiked people's interest.  As it was, they didn't even complete all the planned missions, abandoning the program altogether in 75.   \n\n",
