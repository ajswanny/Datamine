He would nap so hard that you would have to shake him to wake him up, and he could fall asleep anywhere super fast.  I asked him about it and he told me he felt tired all the time because he couldn't sleep at night, he figured he just had insomnia or something but refused to go to a doctor about it.  One day he had a legit mental breakdown after a few drinks, we basically had to babysit him all night and I'm convinced it was because of his constantly exhausted state. \n\nNot long after that incident he went to the doctor about his sleep and it turns out he had been living with sever sleep apnea for years.  The doctor told him he was basically on the verge of a heart attack or stroke because of it.  Now he sleeps with a special mask at night and he has completely changed for the better.  He visibly has way more  emergy and his performance in school  went through the roof.  \n\nEdit: I have got tons of comments from this post saying it inspired people to go have an appointment with a doctor, to which I say good!  I can't stress enough how much getting treatment helped my friend.  It's fortunate such a debilitating condition has such an effective and immediate treatment available for it, so by all means go check it out! Take care.",

He worked 40 hours with us and then 30-40 at a grocery store just killing himself to survive.  Turns out that he was like 9 hours away from a degree he had begun a decade earlier and he just randomly mentioned it to a coworker while they were stocking things.  The managers at both stores knew his situation and worked his schedule together to get him the hours he needed.  They started a tuition fund that anyone could donate to and both sat him down to say he needed to finish his school.  The school put together a pre-req class for him, which he made an A in, and off he went one class at a time.  One year later he walked the stage with a marketing degree and turned his whole life around at 41 or 42.",

During junior year of high school he got in a car accident, broke some bones, and got addicted to the pills he was prescribed. He spiraled downwards after that and barely made it out of high school. Most people lost contact with him and thought he would just be another lowlife.\n\nA few years after high school one of our mutual friends committed suicide and he took it very harshly, but it was enough to change his attitude. He took up an interest in investments and decided to move away from his burnout friends to attend a college. He graduated in less than 4 years and ended up working for a reputable bank earning six figures, and now he's always posting his luxurious vacations on facebook, it was a crazy turn around for him.",

He became part of a terrible group of people that routinely did awful shit in order to score. Imagine robbing your own grandmother,  that caliber of desperation. After a stint being locked up and getting clean he stopped talking to anyone from that group. No communication whatsoever, cold turkey. Lived with his mom, found a job he could walk to since his driver's license was long gone, and started getting in shape physically. He did counseling, broke his heroin habit, got into martial arts as a positive outlet for his energy. Talking to him now, he says breaking contact with all those people was the only way he made it out.",

Stuff like \"1,2,3: put on my workout clothes\", \"1,2,3: empty the dishwasher\", \"1,2,3: answer that email\", \"1,2,3: turn the TV off\".\n\nI promised myself that every \"1,2,3\" would be something I could achieve in less than 10 minutes, and that I would never fail to do something once I finished the countdown. I was amazed at how many of life's problems were solved by overcoming those little moments of inertia during the day.\n\nMy level of motivation before and after that shift was night and day. It made a huge different in my health, career, financial state, etc. I know it probably sounds silly, but my life made a massive and quick change for the better once I adopted this strategy.\n\nEDIT: typos",

I never used to believe in the whole \"scared straight\" thing, but it seriously worked. I picked him up the next day and he looked like he'd seen a ghost. Just kept saying, \"I never want to end up like the people I saw in there, man\" and shaking his head.\n\nIt's been almost a year since then, and he's been totally on the straight and narrow. Got a promotion at work, is making rent on time, I haven't seen him have more than a couple beers in a sitting in that time. He hasn't really elaborated on what he saw that night besides a couple stories about some real tweakers, but whatever it was, I guess it set him straight.",

She joined a bunch of volunteer positions, met a bunch of new people, became part of the 'in' crowd in her city, literally goes out every night with her friends and has a lover that pays for her trips to Europe where they travel around on a motorcycle. Also, she joined a gym and lost a bunch of weight, started taking care of her appearance. It's strange to think just a couple years ago I would hear her sobbing in the shower and now she's this powerhouse! \n\nedit: This didn't happen over night, there were a lot of downers I left out and it took a whole lot of freaking effort on her part and some therapy, but my mom has always been very strong and able to lift herself out ruts. She's not the perfect person or mother, but I can only aspire to someday be the extraordinary woman  that she today. My father has his faults and may not have turned his life around so drastically but I look up to him as well.\n\nedit 2: My mom was really touched by the positive comments! she wants me to clarify that she does not go out with her friends everynight, she works 40 hours a week, and they go to events around town like plays and charity events. And I got it wrong, her boyfriend doesn't pay for her trips, she pays for herself.",

If he wasn't sleeping, eating, or in class, he was in a game. And the weird part was that he didn't actually seem to *enjoy* playing, either, like it was compulsive or something. No matter if he won or lost, he'd be crabby about it. Even in the rare instance where he wasn't playing a game and got invited to a social event, his sleep schedule was so messed up he usually wouldn't make it anyway.\n\nHe finally decided to try giving it up for Lent, and just never went back once he realized how much of a negative effect it'd been having on him. He started eating better (because he wasn't just going for whatever microwave crap he could eat while playing), exercising (because now he had time and energy to do so), taking care of his appearance better (because why would he have shaved, showered regularly, and done laundry when he was just sitting in his room all day?), sleeping a normal amount, and actually connecting with people beyond just seeing them in class. The transformation was honestly impressive. He went from one of the most stereotypical depressed neckbeard freshmen I've ever met to a happy, healthy college kid in the span of a couple months.",

He had to keep a job as well to pay for all his bills and student loans, on top of taking five high level classes per quarter.  We had an e-mail chat group with me, him, and like 5 others.  One day, we all get an e-mail from him saying he was sorry he wasn't going to be able to help us finish our project and that he was dropping out of school and we wouldn't see him again.  All of us really liked the guy and we told him as such.  We also told him things he probably didn't hear too much, like \"you are a vital part of our group\" and that we relied on him for not only his work but his general input as well.  A few hours later, he e-mailed us back saying he thought it over and was not going to drop out, and he was sorry for clogging our e-mail feed with his stuff.\n\nA year or so later, his gf(who became a mutual friend) told us that not only was he simply thinking about dropping out of school at the time of the e-mail, but actually walked to a bridge to end his life that day.  \n\nHe's a high level Manager at Amazon now with a wife and two kids.  It's fun to check up on him time to time and see how happy he now is.  I don't know if us just showing him gratitude that day helped him step away from the edge, but i'm sure it helped at least a bit.  It makes you realize that people just don't tell other people how grateful they are for them enough.  Always let people know the nice things you are thinking of them.  ",

Dude had thousands and thousands of dollars in high interest, unsecured debt. This debt was costing him over a thousand dollars a month in payments.  He and I got to work. We consolidated, we refinanced, and we had a fun little credit card execution ceremony. \n\nAll said and done, we saved him about $500 a month in payments. We put together a plan to use half the savings to continue putting toward the debt for a snowball effect, and to save the other half in an account I would lock up for him. \n\nFast forward to a couple of weeks ago, I saw him at a community event. He told me he is completely debt free (including his house), and has savings for his children to go to college. We hugged and chatted. he never did give me a secret gold coin or grant me three wishes, but I was beaming like a motherfucker, so that's good.  \n\nEdit: Holy smokes. A lot of people asking me for advice. Every situation is different so the best advice I can give is to suggest you go in to a local credit union, find a real, actual friendly person and discuss your finances. Additionally, there is a ton of better than I could give advice from the collective at /r/personalfinance \n\nFinally, I'll just tell you that no matter what your circumstances, debt relief is real, and you can obtain it. You might need to change your lifestyle, but the stress of living with a mountain of debt pressing into your chest is not forever. We Americans are sometimes born (or coerced) into a lifetime of financial slavery as we chase the American Dream, whatever that means to you. You can be free, we can all be free. \n\nEdit2: My kids want pancakes for dinner, so I gotta go. Everybody dance, now. ",

Since that was about 6 months away at that point, I thought 'what the hell', I might as well go get some psychotherapy in the interim.\n\nI was referred to a fantastic psychiatrist who figured out that my medication was not working for me because the dosage was way too low. He helped me develop coping skills and didn't make me feel like my problems were trivial or stupid.\n\nI turned 27 and was feeling a little bit better, so I decided to find a new job. I got one at a fantastic company that values my ideas and is extremely generous in every way. More money, better hours, good for me in every way.\n\nThen I decided to work on my weight. I'd put on 50kg during my extreme depression and was at the point where I could barely function. I saved up my money and got gastric sleeve surgery. I've lost over 50kg so far, and it's only been 9 months post-op!\n\nI'd burned all my bridges with friends, so I was (and am) still pretty socially isolated. One good thing about this is that I had nothing to spend my money on, so I saved it, and as of the 17th of November, I own my own home. \n\nI'm now 28 and am happy to be alive. I still have a lot to work on, but seeing how much I've changed in just two years gives me so much hope. I'm actually kind of excited about what the future has in store for me.

She had recently lost everything including her apartment and pets, and lost custody of her son.  She ended up getting an apartment 90 minutes away from her work because that's all she could afford, but paid $200 a week in gas.  Her phone was constantly blowing up with creditors calling her for delinquent debt.  She drove a pickup truck with 250K miles and was paying $700 in interest per month (I found out the loan was at 26% interest) and unable to make headway on her loan.  As a kid her dad had abandoned her at 16 to foster care, and she ran away and lived on the streets for 3 years.  I decided to try to help her -- refocus.  She was mistrustful and had $40 on a throw-away Visa card to her name.\n\nShe quit drugs and quit stripping 2 months later, got a job as a server.  She quit smoking (cold turkey -- pure willpower).  We filed for personal bankruptcy and eliminated all of the creditors.  She handed over to the loan company the keys to the truck and her grandmother helped her get a sensible used car with good gas mileage but she still was making payments on it.  She then got a math tutor and got her GED which she never thought that she would accomplish having dropped out of high school at 16.  She enrolled in the local community college, while working at the same time, and is Dean's List with a 3.8 GPA after 47 credits.  She was selected for a national honor society and currently serves as their vice president.  She applied for an international study scholarship last spring through the US State Department Scholarship and won, and studied in Ireland at the University of Limerick last May and June.  She now works at a local non-profit in environmental sustainability and will finish her community college degree in the spring of 2018 with a guaranteed transfer to a top-tier four year state university to study English Literature.  Her FICO credit score is now over 700 and Capital One just tripled her credit limit to $5,500 because of her strong credit history.  She says she is very happy, she runs every day, has a cat named Fat Kitty, and just paid off her car.  Total turnaround in life.  It can be done...never give up.",

Basically, every bad stereotype you've heard about \"that creepy homeschooling family\"... that was me. I had no friends outside of the cult, because all outsiders were evil. I was forced to stay home to work and take care of other children all day, because training to be \"a good helpmeet\" was more important than education or social skills. \n\nI was trained for my inevitable torture, starvation and martyrdom under a One World Government. \"Demons\" were everywhere: in objects outside, in toys and books that people gave me, in the faces of people who tried to befriend me. Even I was \"exorcised\" several times. Basically, I was taught that the world was out to kill me and it would probably succeed, but that was okay, because I'd get to Heaven sooner. \n\nI didn't know what it was like to dream of a future where I would grow old. \n\nI didn't know what it was like to trust another human being, to see an open hand and expect a caress instead of a slap. I didn't know that little girls like me weren't supposed to be beaten, raped, and punched. How could I know, when that was my first memory? And even at that moment, at four years old, the only thought in my mind was \"Oh, not this again.\"\n\nI didn't know that I was allowed to think for myself, that I could have a life where I could be free and happy, and never fear for my life again. That was the Heaven I wanted... the Heaven I didn't deserve. \n\nAbout four years ago, I somehow made one outside friend. She treated me like an actual human being, and I finally realized how messed up my life was, that it was wrong and horrifying and it was going to kill me. So I ran away.\n\nI got into University with nothing, and I busted my ass. I wore the same clothes till they fell apart. Starved myself to afford classes. All on that single thread of hope, that I had a friend in the world who thought I was worth something. Soon I was on the honor roll, getting scholarships and awards and recognition. Nobody knew I was homeless, wearing the same clothes from high school. That sometimes after school I spent the evening crying and trembling weakly under my blankets, trying not to panic as flashbacks consumed my mind. \n\nToday, I just finished my first year abroad, at one of the best universities in the world. I can never thank my advisors enough for teaching me and helping me adjust to living in a new country, when just four years ago I didn't even know how to live independently in my own country. But things are getting better. I've made a lot of friends, even had a few romantic interests. I've become a mentor for other foreign students. And when I graduate soon, I have a government job waiting for me in my new home.\n\nI'm finally free, and the world isn't out to hurt me. This is the Heaven I always wanted.",

I was a heroin addict for 10 years - we\u2019re talking hundreds of dollars a day and at one point I began selling heroin to support my habit and that blew up and was more successful than I ever thought it could be...if you call that success.  It also fueled addiction even harder as that whole life style is more addicting than the drug. \n\nTo make a long story short. Got busted due to snitch. I continued addiction for a few months after but one day I was laying in my house with nothing to eat but a bag of chips and some Dr Pepper. No electric. No running water. No gas. Nothing. I decided right there enough was enough. \n\nWithin 90 days, I had a job paying $65k, a car, and was learning to live again on life\u2019s terms. \n\nOctober 14, 2013 is my clean date. \n\nFast forward to present day, I make more than 2x what I did in 2013, drive a new bmw, have a nice house and got married in August. \n\nLife isn\u2019t perfect.

    "body": "Maybe not the fastest but I got kicked out of school at 15, not doing standard grades or any form of qualifications.  I never properly grieved for my Dad who passed when I was younger, moving to another country where the majority of people bullied me, suffering severe depression (with a few suicide attempts) and many things going on at home all contributed into me acting up all of the time and generally being badly behaved. I was on a bit of a slippery slope - drinking alot, taking drugs, shoplifting etc - just overall self destructive and a bit of a bellend. \n\nHowever I always had a deep passion for science and wanting to help people or animals. So one night  in the pub when I was 20 I was having an in-depth conversation with a stranger (as you do), and even though it was very hazy he basically made me see things in a different way and ignited determination in me to do what I've always wanted and not let things get in my way. \n\nFast forward 8 years and I'm 4 months away from finishing honours year in medical school with a degree in Microbiology, alongside completing a diploma in Forensic Science with another university.  I stopped abusing alcohol and drugs, cringe at the fact I would steal small items from shops (I now buy all my makeup in that store hoping that some karma is being restored), and although I am shy I have managed to realise that I don't need to have such a low opinion of myself. Alongside this I managed to squeeze in 3 months of my life volunteering at an animal sanctuary (becoming a vet was a second choice for uni). \n\nThis might not be a huge turnround to many people but it is one I'm modestly the most proud of and hope to inspire anyone who is in a similar situation as I was once in. \n\n**TLDR;** I was a high school drop out going nowhere in life, got drunk one night and now I'm 4 months from completing medical school\n\n\nEDIT: In case anyone is wondering I basically did an access to uni course alongside some distance learning chemistry courses that carried credits so I could put this towards getting into university",

Well by the time i turned about 19, I had a job, smoked all the pot i could want, but also began drinking and doing some narcotics. Now Ive never had an addictive personality and Ive told myself I can quit whenever I wanted. \n\nSkip ahead to mt 21st birthday, GTA5 first person comes out, im stoned and on pills, ended up getting slight motion sickness/ecileptic seizure, i brought myself out of it thankfully with no damage. This was my first sign something had changed in my body. From that day anytime i would smoke pot, I didnt need much, but I would have increased heartrate and paranoia. \n\nAround my 22nd birthday, this is when the change began, I met the love of my life. We went to a mutual friends party and she caught my railing narcotics, I also got so drunk I couldnt walk, mark that as a bad first impression(we had been talking and I had went to her work before but this was our first social event). She left that night without even a goodbye. \nNext day I talked to her, she stated the onl6 way we couldnt continue is if I changed my habits. So I nearly stopped all narcotics(would still have em once in a while along with LSD and pot) but I felt the only way to truly be happy was to be like a kid again, innocent and enjoy life as is. \n\nBy the time I turned 23, i had stopped all narcotics, pot, and lsd, and now i may have a social drink once in a blue moon(Im not much of a drinker now). Still take 1 or 2 puffs of pot and if I had the oppurtunity I would take LSD, but I essentially quit everything cold turkey. \n\nBy 24 me and her have a beautiful baby girl together, shes finishing schooling for veteranian stuff and Ive got a decent paying job. Just turned 25 of Nov 30th amd still on track, next month we will be buying(rent to own) a house together, paying off her 2014 Nissan, and raising our daughter to be the best ahe can be. I am more thann thankful these two came into myself or I could be in a ditch right now honestly. With her support and my will power to not be an addict, I have changed my ways and bettered my life. \n\nTL:DR : Used be a on drugs, had a dead end nowhere job and didnt care. Met a woman, had the willpower to quit drugs, now on a steady path of life with her and oir child. ",

In Ohio they give you a choice of going to hospital or jail after you OD and both times he chose hospital. The 2nd time his parents, siblings, myself, and his 3 other friends who aren\u2019t into that shit had an intervention with him. A week later he was moved into his mom\u2019s, he now has a steady job, his ex (who he\u2019s always been in love with but who wouldn\u2019t be with him if he was using) is back with him, and he has no more contact with his group of junkie friends (deleted them from Facebook, got rid of his phone, they are basically all also in jail/prison for felonies now).\n\nThe 1st time he OD\u2019d he swore he wouldn\u2019t go back to his old ways but then about a month later he invited me over to have a couple beers with me and my old roommate to celebrate \u2018a month of being clean\u2019. When I got there I found my roommate running out of my friends apartment shouting something about an ambulance and to get inside so I ran in. Found him blue on the floor with some guy I didn\u2019t know on the bed. I was holding him and just remember sobbing and praying for help. He was lucky to live (took 8 shots of Narcan to revive him) and he was in the hospital for almost 2 weeks because of liver, heart, brain, and kidney damage from using basically every day for nearly 2 years.\n\nI\u2019m glad that he\u2019s doing well now and want to see him succeed but I know that if he had the opportunity he would throw away everything he\u2019s worked for and go back to his old ways. I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m sharing this but it\u2019s been on my mind a lot recently I guess. I\u2019m glad your friend is doing better and it gave me some hope for mine.",

I promised myself that every \"1, 2, 3\" would be something I could achieve in less than 10 minutes, and that I would *never fail* to do something once I finished the countdown.\n\nIt started off small, anyway.  Easy things.  Put on my workout clothes, and go for a short run.  Empty the dishwasher and load the dirty stuff stacking up in the sink.  Answer a day-old email, turn the TV off and go to bed.  Like I said, easy.  \n\nOver time it became slightly more difficult things.  1, 2, 3, finish my taxes.  1, 2, 3, change my flat tire on the side of the road.  1, 2, 3, weave my way through a traffic jam 5 miles long.  No matter what I wanted to do, saying \"1, 2, 3\" beforehand made it possible.  It started to scare me.  \n\nAs a joke one day I sat down and told myself, \"1, 2, 3, I'm gonna finish this book.\"  A 400 page book.  From the time I opened the cover I couldn't put it down.  I just tore through it.  I barely noticed how quickly I was going through it.  When I finally read the last page, it took me a moment to realize what I had done.  I looked at my watch in horror thinking I had just blown a whole day reading, but it had only been 10 minutes.  The same 10 minutes it took me to do everything else that I preceded with my \"1, 2, 3.\"  At first I thought I had just blacked out a bit and forgot what I was doing, but skimming through the pages I found myself recognizing everything I saw.  I didn't skip anything.  I read the whole thing, front to back, in 10 minutes.  This was the beginning of a very frightening series of events that lead me to where I am today.  \n\nSometimes I find myself wishing I hadn't done the things I've done, despite all the good it's brought to my life.  Sometimes it feels like cheating.  I've done things I regret, and things I'll never forgive myself for doing.  But my heart was in the right place, so that makes up for it, right?  I doubt myself, even as I say those words, but I have to try.\n\n*\"1, 2, 3, bring the world to its knees.\"*",

It was just the life that they knew.\n\nI was in jail a total of about 18 hours. When I was bailed out and was told I hadnt been there a full day I was shocked. It felt like I was in jail for a week. My girlfriend was the one who bailed me and I cried like a baby because I thought she was dead.\n\nAfterwards I was determined to do the things I had been putting off. I got back into the gym, I got my finances in order, and I went to college and I'm currently working on getting a couple associate's degrees in computer science. I never want to be in the situation again. All that over less than a day in jail.",

I would tell/ask him to stop, but then it becomes another debate about how \"your feelings are irrelevant and these are the facts.\". It was exhausting.\n\nEventually, any new person who joined the social group picked up this \"dynamic\" and I became that go to person to berate/insult/poke fun of. No one questioned this behavior because it was like, the norm. If I met someone new who joined our group who'd be really nice to me, 2-3 weeks later, I would notice them making insults/jabs at me for fun. They don't question how it affects me and if I ever try to defend myself, I'm gaslit as being sensitive or something which started off as \"playful\" is now \"great now we're debating because /u/pounded_rice 's feeling boohoo\".\n\nI came from a background of abuse so I have issues with confrontation. I also suspect the guy who keeps insulting me also came from a background of abuse because when I visited his family, I noticed his older brother/sister doing the exact same thing he did to me. It became apparent that he was trying to establish some kind of social hierarchy within our group and I was pickings as the lamb to the wolves. It was the cycle of abuse in effect.\n\nI stopped hanging around them and I've noticed that I just feel...happier now. I'm still kind of sad that I can't hang around with the other company that I enjoy, but their group of friends is so tight knit it just seems easier to completely abandon this part of my life and move onto the next one.",

I've been going through a lot of shit recently, not to the degree where I'd hurt myself or anything (my body is doing that for me haha), but I've seriously considered dropping out of school because of a medical condition that I've been going through. But when I went home over Thanksgiving and told my group of childhood friends about what I've been dealing with, they all told me how proud they were of me and how inspiring it was for me to be doing so well despite what I'm going through. It really changed my perspective, and I feel so much more motivated to push through everything with just that bit of love and support from my friends. ",

I will be convinced that people who care only care out of pity or obligation, that reaching out is a burden other people shouldn't be saddled with, that everyone has problems, and making mine known is both selfish and petulant. \n\n\nReaching out is a victory that merits exalted praise, but is too often met with rejection or indifference. Hearing active compassion in someone after being convinced that such a tone doesn't exists is a comforting affirmation that builds people up and saves lives. \n\n\nIf someone is in crisis remember this:\n\n1. Listen. Nobody asks for a cyst to justify itself. It just drains. \n\n2. Assert nothing. Their perceptions are real in their consequences. \n\n3. Active compassion. Don't just care. Care obviously \n\n\nEDIT: whoa, so my inbox just got inundated with melancholy. You folks are all beautiful, caring, compassionate people, and I don't have to know you to love you. Go be awesome human beings to each other. Thanks for the goldx2\n\nA few words on reaching out:\nAdmitting mental anguish is fucking hard. Asking for help for mental pain is fucking terrifying. Do it anyway. Be scared, feel your pulse rise, and trust that someone will care. Text a friend. A pastor. A relative or spouse or professor or nurse or coworker or anyone. Tell the checkout dude scanning your can of green beans. Tell family and strangers and do what you need to do to gasp in all the suffocating air until you feel better. Shame can go fuck itself. You are in pain, and you need help, and you deserve to be heard.\n\nWhen you find yourself at the end of your rope, tie a knot and hold the fuck on.\n\nEDIT:EDIT u/posts_helpful_info listed a [number of resources](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/7i0s1o/whats_the_fastest_way_youve_seen_someone_improve/dqvre6s/) that, yeah, should be broadcast anytime mental health or suicide becomes a public discussion.\n\nKeep each other.\n\n",

I realized a few months ago that when she said that she didn\u2019t have time it meant she didn\u2019t have any time for me. Which sucks but you realize that it\u2019s for the best. We\u2019ve both changed a lot and I don\u2019t really enjoy her company anymore when we do hang out because she treats me poorly and dismisses what I say. You\u2019re not always going to remain friends with the people you were once close to especially if they don\u2019t seem to care or want to put in the effort. I was depressed for a long time, perhaps I still am from time to time struggling, but I know I can\u2019t count on her to be there for me. It makes me sad to write that down considering every time she visits all she does is complain about her friends and I try to listen and console her and she sorta does for me also but I\u2019m willing to bet she complains about me to her friends. :/ ",

You have a 50% chance to get your foot in the door by applying. \n\nI\u2019ve had decent paying jobs that have enabled me to be that breakeven individual with a little spending money and got sick of it. \n\nI applied to a huge amount of companies that kind of fit my previous experience in certain fields and others that I had absolutely 0 experience in. \n\nFinally I got a call to a dream job with arguably some of the best benefits I could ever get. \n\nI highly recommend looking into skilled trades, but don\u2019t just limit your search to that. Branch past indeed or any other job app and find something that may interest you. \n\nMe for example. I have experience in heavy machinery, sales and manual labor. I picked one I enjoyed the most and typed in a search for companies in my area that may fit that criteria and applied to the job openings they had. \n\nMost people just jump on an app and browse. Go past that and I promise you\u2019ll fall into something. \n\nAlso, don\u2019t give up. There\u2019s going to be days where you\u2019re wondering what the hell you\u2019re even doing but it\u2019ll all be worth it when that one company picks up the phone. \n\nI\u2019m sorry for the late response, and for the terrible formatting I\u2019m new to reddit!\n\nGood luck!\n\nEdit: okay, you don\u2019t have an actual 50% chance of getting a job you apply to and I\u2019m sorry for making it sound like it did. That was not my intention! I\u2019m well aware there\u2019s a magnitude of variables that goes into the hiring process of each individual. It was more in the sense of you miss 100% of the opportunities you don\u2019t take. If you apply you at least have a chance. \n\n\nMy current job I applied for on a whim and even had people tell me I wouldn\u2019t get it do to a DUI on my record. On my application I put at the top \u201cI HAVE A DUI!\u201d And was called in and the hiring manager was impressed by my honesty. I fit their needs, and I was hired. Never ever lie thinking it\u2019s going to better your odds because if they find out in your hiring process they\u2019ll drop you like a bad habit. \n\nFor anyone looking to get into the skilled trades or railroad shoot me a message and I\u2019ll be more than happy to help. I\u2019m not an expert people and I hope I don\u2019t come off as one. So many people give up or are scared to apply.

So started therapy for my depression. Tried the drug meetings but didn't fancy them too much.  It was just pure will power. I have an amazing girlfriend too that helps me day to day and her little boy my step son.  They kept me going at first but the last few months I'm so determined to keep going no matter what.  I feel like I have the will power to do it alone if anything bad happens.  Sorry if it's hard to understand.  I'm meant to be working :) ",

    "body": "My brother went on the merry go round for nearly years and completely screwed up his life - in and out of jail, children with two junkies that he's having to pay support for, all kinds of issues.  He lost touch with us, his family and was in \"real prison\" for that final time  , his second trip there. Ugly shit - real real ugly.\n\n\nHe had an epiphany moment which he doesn't share very much but he just stopped doing drugs in prison and stayed clean and got away from known associates and moved in with my parents after - who took him back one last time.  He stopped lying.  He told himself the truth and my parents and just basically - lack of a better word - humbled himself.  He's not a 12 stepper but he went to meetings (as in he did things like that but he doesn't feel like that's what he needs now - he did what he needed, no matter what - to try everything). He found some religion which he likes but it's not something we talk about really - he's private with that - but I know it's what he turns to on the daily because for him the Be Honest an True and Totally Humble is part of it.  Higher power ideas I guess without the belonging to a group?  That sounds like him.\n\nANYWAY he just stopped and he's married to a woman he met doing this who was clean  for a lot longer than he is and like him - they're incredibly happy and I can see they're just not doing any of that.  They're both in a new area away from all the people of the past.  They are so healthy and fit and he was just given a really fantastic job he's always wanted - nothing fancy, one suited to his skills - that he can take into the rest of his life or at least until he can't work any longer.  He won't have things others have, but so what?  They have some of the best stuff and what they want.  They moved to be near things they like - they're clean.\n\nAND as he says \"no more drama, no more bullshit, no  more lying to people, it's all good man.  Why the fuck did I ever do that stuff?  It isn't anywhere near as good as just getting through the day on my own wits\".\n\nMy favorite story and when I knew he wasn't lying this time - and I've been through it with him.  I was the last family member to talk to him and sadly it was as he was going back to prison and it was to tell him he was no longer allowed to engage our parents, he had to go through me but we all just wanted him to work out his life on his own now because he'd ripped us all off or broken our hearts somehow (no exaggeration - my parents had given him thousands and thousands because he said he was broke and he bought drugs with it because he was a dealer - may not seem surprising if your life has been about TV shows but it was a final straw for them.  For me it was a final straw watchign my aging father try to make excuses for him as he moved his shit into a storage facility after another probation break and in jail while my brother's LITERAL JUNKIE half his age \"girlfriend\" (???) twitched....\n\nANYWAY he said he broke down and cried when a cop pulled him over for a tail light out and he realized it was the first time since he was 18 that there wasn't something wrong - he had insurance, he had a current license, he wasn't high, there weren't drugs or a gun in the car, he didn't have enough money to make him suspicious, he wasn't drunk on and on - he realized \"I WAS WALKING A STRAIGHT LINE AND NO ONE COULD STOP ME\".  \n\nAnd that was at the age of 48.  30 years of not doing that.  \n\nHe's been great for the past 8 years now.\n\nIt can happen - but he's worked hard and had a lot of hurt in the process.\n\nGood luck.  Seeing him now?  I know it's worth it.  His recent selfie?  I've never seen a picture like that.\n\nJust 7 years ago he'd never even put a song on a computer before let alone taken a selfie. ",

Part of your active consciousness is rebelling against the rest of you and, as OP so eloquently puts it, 'weaponizing' your sensory input in order to use it against you. Do not trust that inner voice. It's probably been hijacked. Challenge it ruthlessly (Ruth will come along later). And, indeed, reach out.

His \"psychotic fever dreams\" are probably low blood sugar from not eating and his CNS trying to free up more energy with cortisol and adrenaline. You can soak your sheets with sweat when you get hypoglycemic at night, and its quite easy to see why adrenaline release would make your dreams more chaotic.\n\nIf he was having such huge problems with the stims, even at lower doses with the weakest stims, it kind of begs the question : Is this is a misdiagnosis of ADHD?\n\nThe best way to go about this is to get a genetic test and look at your genes that are HIGHLY correlated with ADHD(a highly genetic neurodevelopmental disorder affecting the dopaminergic pathways/centers of the brain). Find where the problem is and supplement it with the appropriate pharmacological mechanism/drug. These are going to be your DAT(SLC) DRD MAO and DBH. For instance, I know I have the bad version of SLC6A3 which is the dopamine reuptake pump. Dr. Russel Barkley has determined that people with this version reuptake dopamine at a rate 30-75% higher than the other versions, which results in behavioral/attention/motivational persistence issues.  I also had no bad versions for post synaptic recepticles, or production or breakdown. No problems making dopamine, recieving it, or too much breakdown but it gets sucked back up really quick. So a simple DRI has done the trick remarkably well. I can tell a stark difference between how well my brain works at the peak of a methylphenidate dose, and when its worn off. He could get his genetic testing back and have no genes highly correlated with ADHD, and that's the time to really start reconsidering the diagnosis.",

Not sure of the technical term, but the other guy had my friend's arm yanked behind his back, how the cops tend to do, where the hand ends up by the opposite shoulder blade. The other guy really had it sunk in, he was waiting, the ref was waiting, I was waiting, for my buddy to tap. It just looked so ungodly painful, with his arm like that and the other guy wrapped around him sinking the hold in deeper. My buddy just grunted, grimaced, lurched forward, and pushed his hand down his own back to his waist and slowly brought it to his side and around to the front. Totally surprised everyone. The other guy eventually won on points, but my friend never tapped and went the distance.\n\nHe'd probably get me to tap out pretty fast.",

If there is a risk of non-performance on someone's part, and the cost will be born by someone else, surety bonds are often involved. A good example of this besides bail is in construction. If a subcontractor doesn't perform, it can derail an entire project, so they may be required by the general contractor or the owner of the property to post a surety bond, which is issued by a financial institution, and that works a bit like insurance, but takes the form of a bond that pays out an amount up to its face value if certain conditions are met.",

Odds are, you don't have 50k of liquid cash for your bail, but you CAN scrape up 5k.  So, the bondsman gets your 5k and posts your bail on a bond.  If you show up to court, he pockets your 5k and it ends there.  It gets interesting when you decide to skip bail.  Now, at this point, two things happen: the bondsman hires bounty hunters to bring you in, and he calls his bail attorney.  The bail attorney goes over every detail of the court papers and looks for *any* discrepancies.  If any I is not dotted or T crossed, the bondsman is off the hook for the 50k and the bail attorney has earned his keep.  Otherwise, the bounty hunters drag your sorry as to jail and the bondsman *still* doesn't have to pay.\n\ntl/dr: Bail bondsmen *rarely* actually pay the bail money.",
