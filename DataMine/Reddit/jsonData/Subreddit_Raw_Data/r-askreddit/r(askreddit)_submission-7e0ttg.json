Their comments weren't anything too negative, it was mostly the typical comments about deaf people by people who were completely clueless about how deafness worked.\n  When I brought my stuff to the checkout I kindly reminded them that it's a pretty bad idea to talk about somebody thinking that they can't understand what you're talking about... because the chances are that they do in fact understand what you're talking about.\n   The look on their faces were completely classic.\n\non the other side: One time my best friend and I were people watching at the mall, and we randomly started rating the men around us. In sign language, of course. There was this one dude sitting near us and we start rating his looks and his body. I said that he looked like he had a nice butt, and that his eyes were really beautiful, with the color of the deep ocean. so I rated him a 10/10.\n  Then he came over to us,and then told us in sign language: \"Thanks for the compliments, ladies. you really made my day, haha.\"\n We were both so shocked and embarrassed. heh.",

They were sooooo happy that they found someone who spoke German and couldn't stop taking pictures with me to show their family 'the guy that saved their day'. I walked them to the Gallery and gave them a bit of an impromptu walking/bus tour along the way. That was the day I gained two Omas.\n\nEDIT: Thank you so much for the gold kind stranger! And remember, help those you can! :) ",

This event is pretty big and there used to be literally thousands of Hmong people there, it's an event where we basically celebrate our heritage. I am Hmong (Southeast Asian), but I look like I'm Hispanic just to give you some background. Anyways, I had to go to the bathroom because y'know, I'm only human and all. When I went to go wash my hands, these two older guys (probably about 35-40) come in and as soon as they see me, they say something (in Hmong) along the lines of, \"These damn Mexicans thinking they can come to our New Year. Maybe we should call the cops to take him back home to Mexico, hahahahahaha.\" Well, in comes my cousin by sheer luck so I ask him in Hmong, \"Hey, where did you guys go? Last time I saw you guys was at the ball tossing area (it's this weird courting activity that involves throwing a tennis ball/softball while flirting).\" We end our very short conversation and then as I was exiting the bathroom, I made absolutely sure that I gave the most judgemental look ever to those two men. It worked like a charm and you could tell by their facial expressions that they knew they messed up.\nEDIT: Grammar",

Everyone assumes you won\u2019t speak any Japanese at all so they stick to as much English as they\u2019re comfortable with or you basically just play charades. \n\nAt a restaurant in Kobe, the waitress was practically fluent in English so we chatted a while and it came up that I\u2019m studying Japanese so we had a little small talk and she was impressed. Then the owner came over to talk but wasn\u2019t as confident in his English so he had the waitress translate. He was asking all these questions about where we\u2019d been so far, where we were staying, how we liked everything, if we\u2019d been down to Kobe Port yet, etc. It was simple enough that I understood 100% without her translation, and the waitress could tell. Finally, she says to him, in Japanese \u201cBy the way, he understands what you\u2019re saying.\u201d His eyes practically bugged out of his head and he got SUPER excited and asked if we wouldn\u2019t mind waiting 30 minutes for him to close up and send everyone home. \n\nSo, I wait, he closes everything up and we all end up hanging out that night. He drove us around the city, bought us drinks, even drove back to the AirBNB. Japan is amazing. \n\nEDIT:\n\nI forget my handle on here is still Zhongguo, I am actually a 6\u20192 bald white dude - so very noticeably foreign in Japan. I\u2019ve always loved Asian cultures and in high school people called me Zhongguo because I was the only one in my history class who kept acing the Chinese exams. \n\nFor anyone thinking about going to Japan, even if you don\u2019t speak any Japanese, DO IT. It\u2019s the most beautiful country filled with the nicest people. \n\nEDIT 2:\n\nThe restaurant\u2019s name was Hanasato in Kobe. It\u2019s a short walk from one of the JR stations.

He was fluent in French, Spanish, and German and he lived in France for a year or two. He came back to the US and taught French for a few years before getting his JD and PharmD, He was constantly trying to teach us French whenever he could when we were little. \n\nHe kept in touch with his French professor from college and when we were in France we stayed with them in St. Hilaire de Riez. They had a small party with some of their friends and everyone sat around talking and drinking wine. As much as he tried to teach us French, we could only do as much as ordering food and reading restaurant menus and such, so everyone was talking in English except for one man's wife that was there and didn't speak English. The hosts were translating most things for her.\n\nAt one point, the man says something in French like \"Americans don't value things like learning foreign languages.\" Not knowing my dad spoke French. My dad looks at him and in French replies something along the lines of \"You're right, lots of Americans aren't introduced to foreign languages until they are older and already out of the prime time of their life to start learning.\" And that this was why he started teaching his kids French as early as possible and even why he brought his kids to France, hoping that we'd gain an appreciation for another language and culture. I didn't know what the guy had said or what my dad had said until after we left, but I remember the look on the guys face and how he was clearly apologizing repeatedly. The host laughed too and explained my dads history with French and his education. To say the man was embarrassed would be an understatement.\n\nFriday will be 13 years since my dad passed away at 55 years old. He was such an awesome person and loved by everyone he met. He would never take offense to something even like that guy. He was from a tiny southern town in the middle of nowhere and grew up with nothing and worked his ass off to get where he was in life.

Unfortunately for them this was another language in which my cousin is fluent and the scenario played out very much in the same way for them. \n&nbsp;\n\nYou would think at this point that perhaps they had learned their lesson and would stop trying to make snarky comments about my family gathering.

This is Houston, there is a surprinsingly large number of people who look Hispanic and don't speak any Spanish. \n\nAnyways, I had a gentleman in his 30s and his family ask me to clean him up - give him a bed bath. He was completely able, just a bit weak, so I thought it was a little odd but nonetheless figured it was a good chance to change his linens and clean him up and make sure his skin was intact. \n\nI cleaned him down from head to toe, washed his hair, changed his sheets, put lotion on his feet, gave him new gown, compression stockings, and safety socks. There is one area I draw the line, however. If the patient is completely awake and able, I will hand them a moist cloth to clean their own private parts with... I'm not even asking them to reach around, just do the front! \n\nI did this with this gentleman and he looked at the cloth and set it down next to him. He picked up his cell phone, called his wife (who was right outside the room) and asked her to come in. Then he proceeds to tell her, in Spanish \"Clean me up because this lazy girl doesn't want to do it\". Wife cleans his private parts and then leaves me to finish everything else, which I do. \n\nWhen I let the family know I am done and they all come back in the room, I very politely tell him, in Spanish (this is the first time they are hearing me speak Spanish) \"I apologize for leading you to believe I was lazy and did not want to clean you up. Just remember you're going to have to learn to do it because I'm not coming home with you when you get discharged\" both patient and family were too shocked to reply. I just told them, in English, \"Press the call button if you need anything else\" and left.\n\nIt was a nice quiet night from them :-)\n\nPSA: if you are healthy enough to clean your own genitals it is just weird to ask someone else to do it for you, especially a total stranger.",

But being 17 year-old males, my friend Mitch and I were far more interested in the topless beaches we\u2019d get to visit in Nice.\n\nSo, Mitch and I set ourselves up on the rocky beach one beautiful sunny day, and awaited a parade of beautiful and topless French women. At first, we were a bit disappointed \u2014 apparently, topless swimming was more popular with 80 year-old French women than we\u2019d imagined.\n\nEventually, a young couple set up a towel right next to us. As we listen in to their conversion, we realize they\u2019re both Americans, and they\u2019re arguing. She wanted to go topless.

But that day, at that moment, we engaged in the most fluent and convincing French conversation of our young lives. No wide-eyed, horny American teens here... just two sophisticated French guys enjoying the beach, uninterested in some amazingly hot American girl and whether she took off her top. We were conjugating verbs like our lives depended on it.\n\nEventually, the boyfriend got pissed and left, and his girlfriend went topless. Mitch and I continued to play it cool, but this really did seem like the greatest thing that had ever happened ever.

Kalian sudah pacaran?\" Which translates as \"Is this the boy you were talking about? Are you guys dating now?\" Her daughter just blushes in embarrassment, hugs me, and says good night to me as she assumes I'm about to leave.\n\nBefore I leave, I say good night, and I just let out this line, \"Terima kasih, Ibu.

I hope from then on each of those workers thought more about what they say in Spanish in public.\n\nIt's not an uncommon language here in the U.S. and more and more people than you would think are speaking Spanish and learning it.

I've been here since I was a year old, attended local school for almost all of primary so I was fluent in Cantonese. \n\nWhen I was around 7/8 years old, I was in Sogo, which was this huge 10 story department store in Causeway Bay, with my dad (who was from the UK and spoke zero cantonese). We were on our way to the 6th floor which was where all the toys were (still is to this day). \n\nWe decided to take the elevator up and we shared it with these 4 teenage boys. As we went up I could hear them talking about us, basically calling us \"filthy white devils\" and how we should go back home. I turned around, glared at them and just as we were about to leave I let out the NASTIEST fart of all time, virtually silent and EXTREMELY deadly. Proceeded to leave the elevator and as the doors were about to close I said 'EAT MY SHIT' in cantonese. I'll never forget the mortified expressions on their faces. Let alone having to inhale what is basically Sauron's soul in the form of a fart.  \n\nMy dad asked me what happened, I told him, got two new Gundams. Nuff said.",

I used to use it in shops there to get the \"local\" price; I'd just hang out pretending I was browsing until someone Chinese bought something similar to what I wanted. I'd listen to the price they got, then I'd grab my item and approach the vendor. Usually I wouldn't even say anything, they'd just hold up a calculator with a very inflated price as soon as they saw me walk over. Then I'd calmly ask in Mandarin why that other person had gotten a much lower price.

I give the man a crisp 100 yuan bill. He lets me pick out the watch and as I'm getting the watch he swaps my 100 yuan bill with a counterfeit bill that has a tear on it. He told me in English that he can't take the bill because it has a tear on it and that I need to give him a different 100 yuan bill.

Little do they know though that the dealership has the offices bugged and can hear everything they\u2019re saying.

The problem is, I had customers complain because I was \"distracting\" with all of my signing. My manager attempted to get me to stop using sign language because she had gotten a few complaints. I'm normally a bit of a coward, but I told her if she wanted me to stop she'd have to fire me.\n\nMy point is, people can be very rude when they don't understand something, but especially for the deaf, they don't have the option to learn a spoken language -- well, they do, but they won't hear it.

I want to point out, she's always really polite and nice, unless you are rude to her. Then she stands her ground. We are looking trough some clothes and again speaking Finnish. We hear a really frustrated middle aged woman say to her friend:\n\n\"I can't believe how rude they are, I want to look at those clothes too, they've been at it forever. I don't have time for this.\"\n\nWe were at H&M! She could have looked at something else and come back after few minutes. We weren't blocking her, just looking for my size and sometimes it takes a minute. My aunt turns to her and says politely:\n\n\"Oh, go ahead then, doesn't look like you have the same size anyway. We can wait.\"\n\nShe took one of the shirts and just left really embarrassed. Also one when I was a substitute teacher:\n\nHad two boys who came from Russia, they had a way of using Russian as their own secret language. They clearly talked about this one 4th grader, I didn't understand a word, but they kept looking at her and then talking to each other. They were on 3rd grade. So this girl listens for a while and I didn't get involved, because I knew she had guts. I kind of hoped she would put an end to it, because we suspected the boys said really bad things about teachers and other students. We had talked about it, but they denied it, and we don't speak Russian, so we just had to believe them and explain our school language is Finnish. The girl later told me she said to those boys:\n\n\"I'm russian and you are being really rude. You should not talk like that about other people.\"\n\nI just remember how the boys stopped and ran away. I praised her when she told me, because she handled it really well. These situations are so common that I'm just wondering how often I miss them, because I can't know every language there is. Especially when me and my cousin (aunt's child) are partying in Germany, we speak Finnish of course, lot of guys comment our appearance. Usually we just let it slide, but when confronted, usually those guys just apologize and tell they didn't mean anything bad which I believe. We just do it because it's kind of fun",

Takei got a summer job picking strawberries on a farm. Most of his fellow strawberry pickers were Hispanic, but the people in charge of handing out pay were Japanese American. He overheard them discussing in Japanese how they were cheating the strawberry pickers and he chewed them out in their own language and didn't let them get away with it.\n\nSource: *To the Stars: The Autobiography of George Takei* (obviously by George Takei)\n\nEdit: I had not heard the news but my point still stands, oppression has been around a long time and a group experiencing oppression doesn't mean that group won't perpetrate it against others.",

I had frequent conversations with them because I was so excited that I actually COULD outside of a classroom setting! \n\nI asked my (half Puerto Rican) aunt later why that was. The secret to Puerto Rican Spanish? Don't pronounce the letter S, don't fully pronounce half your Ds, make all your terminal Rs sound like Ls, sometimes Bs sound like Vs but sometimes not, and LL sometimes sounds like \"Y\" but sometimes sounds like \"ZH.\" Factor in speed, and it becomes a mush of barely distinguishable consonants to the uninitiated.
