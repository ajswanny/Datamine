It was the beginning of Christmas holidays and I was staying in the house, so I said that it's fine.\n\nWhen the workers arrived, one of them asked me if it's okay if he brings a kettle for tea. I said that there's no need for that, I'll make them all the tea they want.\n\nI regretted it. They asked for a cup at least once an hour. I had no idea that British people actually drink THAT MUCH tea.\n\nThe guys brought their own tea, milk and sugar, though, so it wasn't out of my pocket. And then the landlady gave me a bottle of quality vodka for watching over them. \n\nEdit: we drank vodka cocktails while playing Mario Kart championship on Nintendo Wii with Chris, it was actually awesome.\n\nEdit 2: the workers were the ones who told me that those were original windows, they've not been replaced since the house was built in 1906.

    "body": "**Item #:** SCP-9029\n\n**Object Class:** Euclid\n\n**Special Containment Procedure:** SCP-9029 is to remain closed and inside a locked hard metal container outfitted with an electromechanical alarm linked directly to the facility's central surveillance system, as well as a direct non-conductive analog connection to Regional Surveillance Post [REDACTED]. Should SCP-9029 be opened and an instance of SCP-9029-1 removed from the inside, it MUST remain open until the instance is placed back inside the object. Failing this procedure, SCP-9029-1 must be immediately incinerated by gamma ray bombardment in order to ensure proper disintegration of every electronic component using a Wyvern-6 type mobile incineration unit. In every cases, SCP-9029-1 must remain inside a double walled Faraday cage properly rated for all sub-Microwave frequencies. Access to the Faraday Cage must be outfitted with the same combination of eletromechanical alarms and analog transmission lines as the metal container. SCP-9029-1's main containment challenge is the vulnerability of the containment team to the anxiogenic effects of the broadcast. Thus, any recovery effort should include ample supplies of Anxiolytic drugs in automatic delivery systems.\n\n**Description:** \nSCP-9029 is a reinforced cardboard packaging for a PXWZ450 Digital camera with serial number 1-829247-AJDH-228028353; its anomalous behavior consists in an extreme sturdiness, and the ability to generate a single SCP-9029-1 instance when closed, seemingly out of thin air. The object's origins are unknown, it was successfully tracked down by a Composite Intervention and Research Team under Dr. [REDACTED] during a spate of mass panic events in the southern United States on [INSUFFICIENT ACCESS] but no trace of its production could be located at the relevant production facilities. \n\nWhenever SCP-9029 is opened, a single camera will be present, hereafter refered to as SCP-9029-1; how long it has been closed for is irrelevant. SCP-9029-1 exhibits extremely unsual and potentially dangerous Electronic and Psychological interferences which are as of yet unexplained. When turned on, it will immediately broadcast its feed on all radiofrequencies, completely replacing existing nearby feeds regardless of broacasting power. The Video feed sent by SCP-9029-1 will exagerate any potentially alarming detail and cause immediate disconfort to the camera operator as well as any subject in direct focus of the feed, within a few seconds. After a mean elapsed time of 3.55 minutes, subjects will start to exhibit signs of severe anxiety, which will start to spread to viewers of the broadcast by travelling up the chain of the feed: local technicians on site, TV station personnel, and finally the general population vewing the feed on their TV. Radiofrequencies used for other purposes than video broadcast will experience severe interferences. \n\nWhile SCP-9029-1's behavior is clearly an anomaly and its mechanism of action has not yet been explained, post-incident analysis after the [REACTED] containment failure has shown that the anxiety and panic it creates does not follow normal psychological patterns: for instance, individuals exhibiting symptoms of shock but with inverted vital patterns. TV crews in the vicinity of SCP-9029-1 will start to report imaginary or exagerated threats outside of their cameras field of views, operators will leave their cameras (including SCP-9029-1) in useless positions while pretending to properly operate, and the information usually displayed on screen by TV Station personnel will be replaced by useless non-sensical information typically indicating a state of severe distress, such as \"No no no no no no no...\" endlessely rolling on the ticker tape display.

    "body": "Tell me about it, my name is made from the most embarrassing thing that's ever happened to me.\n\nEdit:\nWhen I was about 11 or 12 years old, I was living in the US. My family and I loved(and still do) Panda Express. We went there a lot. One time my sister was visiting from Mexico and we took her to PE.\n\nI don't why I decided to be a man and graduate from the kids meal to the full sized two entrees and one side plate but that decision marked my life. After having gobbled up the whole thing I pretty much rolled out of the store. My mom and sister went shopping for clothes and so my Dad and I went to some other store (Target) to pass the time. I went to the videogame section and he went to the magazines. \n\nRight now is probably the best time to mention that I ABSOLUTELY LOATHE crapping in any bathroom that's not my houses. Alright back to the story...\n\nSo while I'm playing some of the demos I keep getting these cramps that signal the incoming shitstorm. So after a couple of moderate ones I go to my Dad:\n\nMe: Can we leave? I gotta poop.\n\nDad: Just go poop.\n\nMe: I really don't like public bathrooms.\n\nDad: Come on, Pepto, are you seriously gonna cut your sister's enjoyment because you don't wanna poop here?\n\nI was swayed by his argument and instead of pooping I figured I could hold it in for a few more minutes. I was correct about. For like 15 more minutes I kept playing and felt perfectly well. Then suddenly the most intense bowel movement cramp of my life. I honestly thought I would crap myself then and there. \n\nI tightened my butt cheeks as much as I could and held out praying to God that I could survive this one. He listened to my prayers and I survived it. So I quickly go to my Dad\n\nMe: We need to leave now, I'm gonna crap my pants.\n\nDad: Fine.\n\nI don't know if I'm the only one, but whenever I resist a bowel movement it's like it goes away for a little bit and I feel ok, like I can hold for even longer. Although it will come back with even more strength later on.\n\nWell... That was quite some comeback. Right at the entrance to Target, **literally** over the metal bar that's at the entrance of all supermarkets, I crapped my pants with a force unlike any other. \n\nNot just like a little squirt, the full load.\n\nI panicked bad and I didn't know what to do, so i stood there for like 20 seconds stinking up the place and my jeans starting to darken due to the moisture of the poop. My Dad tried to get me to move and my legs were hard as rock. \n\nAt that point, I started having a different kind of diarrhea. I could stop saying the same thing, over and over.\n\n>Pap\u00e1, me cagu\u00e9!\n\nWhich is Spanish for: Dad I what myself.\n\nSo my Dad went into full action and literally pushed me to start moving and get out of the entrance and I started moving. As if it couldn't get any worse I had to try to walk normally to the car(At that point my Dad had decided to go home quickly and not tell my mom or sister, get changed and come back).\n\nWalking normally, not wide-legged, while your soiled is the most bizarre feeling ever. I don't wish it upon anyone :(\n\nThis is getting long, so here's the conclusion: \n\nI cried on the way home and begged my dad not to ever tell anybody. Bless his soul for 7 years no one else, not even my mom, found out. His cover up was \"A friend of his had a car emergency so we went home and changed into work clothes as quickly as we could.\" He changed clothes as well and we took a long ride around town trying to make our \"Car Emergency\" seem believable.\n\nAt least it was incredible Father-Son bonding experience.\n\nTL;DR: Crapped my pants and froze for 30 seconds at the entrance of a super market. Wish I'd had some peptobismol...",
