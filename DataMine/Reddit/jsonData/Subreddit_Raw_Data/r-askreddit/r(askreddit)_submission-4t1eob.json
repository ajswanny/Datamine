    "body": "I'm in Ankara, kind of in the middle of it all, got a decent view of the city so I'll share what I see and hear. latest:\n\n06:19 AM ongoing clashes. I hear heavy machinegun fire, probably from a helicopter. Jets still in the air. I think it's from Erdogan's palace area again.\n\nEDIT 2: 06:30 AM non-stop machine-gun fire, sounds very close. I think it's around the intelligence service HQ, I'm really tired but cannot sleep because of the shooting and the jets continuously pass literally right above where I'm staying. Will probably keep updating until this shit ends..\n\n06:33 shots heard coming from another part of Ankara, sounded much heavier, probably another helicopter. Cannot pinpoint location.\n\n06:38 gunshots again, sounds like assault rifles.\n\nEDIT 3: Something worth mentioning, Istanbul is somewhat of an AKP (Erdogan's party) stronghold and I think the amount of people willing to heed Erdogan and go out in the streets protesting the military is higher there than in here in Ankara. Also the coup soldiers have apparently been more willing to shoot civilians in Ankara than in Istanbul.\n\n06:58 AM: Shots continue\n\nEDIT 4:\n\n07:13: Explosion (~~I assume jets breaking the sound barrier cannot create shockwaves cause I felt it~~ - could be a jet breaking the sound barrier). Jets passing close again. \n\n07:15-19: Gunshots resume, not sure where, sounds like it's coming from the center of the city. More jets passing.\n\nalso thanks for all the nice thoughts, appreciate it. \n\nEDIT 5:\n\n07:27: I'm hearing a **lot** of ambulances. It appears that many people were hurt in the last few strikes.\n\n07:40: jets still in the air. \n\nEDIT 6: \n\nLooking at the news now, finally they are reporting some of the events that occurred tonight. over 700 soldiers arrested, a general dead, over 60 civilian deaths (official numbers, expect it to rise). 1000+ injured. Tanks are apparently firing at police barricades in Ankara right now (around 08:00 AM), I heard some blasts that could potentially confirm this.\n\nstatement from the TSK (Turkish Armed Forces)\n\n>Turkish Army Forces are continuing to \"Coup\". We will take down people or any forces who tries to resist to us. Please stay in your home for your Health and safety. Regards to the public - Turkish Army Forces.\n\nIf we're to believe the TSK, this is far from over. If we're to believe the media, Turkey the coup has been repelled\n\n08:14 AM: Jets are still flying, haven't heard a shot in a while now\n\n08:17 AM: A Turkish official just claimed that no jets are in rebel/coup control, only a few helicopters. I would like him to tell these government airplanes to stop flying 100 meters above our heads then. Right after this statement, another warning is issued; that coup airplanes will be shot down if they don't cease flight. I'm confused.\n\nEDIT 7: JUST NOW (08:25~) According to the news, a group of civilians were trying to prevent airplanes taking off at the Akinci army air base located in Ankara. The soldiers at the base replied with gunfire, killing 5. If the jets are in government control, why are civilians trying to prevent airplanes from taking off and then dying in the process??\n\n08:31 I heard some more gunshots now. It appears the police is besieging military positions. I'm hearing that 16 soldiers have been killed in the exchange.\n\n08:33 ~~I like how the media claims that there is no air-traffic or jets in Ankara now when I can clearly hear at least one circling the city~~ as someone pointed out, it could be normal air traffic as Turkish Airlines have resumed flights\n\n08:40 things have calmed down a bit. the muezzins (dudes in the mosques) are reciting verses/prayers, perhaps to mourn the dead\n\nEDIT 8:\n\n09:05 AM: It looks like I can try grab some sleep now. The jets are no longer flying and I cannot hear any blasts or shots anymore.. hopefully it will stay that way. traffic has resumed and I see people leaving for work right now.\n\n~~Final edit:~~ EDIT 9:\n\nThere are ongoing clashes and sieges but it does seem like the government has won. The media and the intelligence service claimed as early as 03:30 AM that the coup had been repelled, while explosions and clashes were ongoing in Ankara, if anyone is wondering why I decided to update on the situation here. Thanks for all the nice thoughts, hope my country can pull itself out of this mess. Good night (day)\n\nEDIT 10:\n\nIt has been quiet since 9 am. According to some news there has been a few clashes around Ankara and final arrests have been conducted. News are looping the events, now claiming this is all Fetullah Gulen's organization at work\n\ndeath toll rose to 250, 1440 injured\n\nIf you haven't kept up with the news, thousands of soldiers of different ranks are being arrested, over 2700 **judges** have been arrested. A governor has been dismissed. They are blaming the coup on Fetullah Gulen \n\nAgain thanks for the messages, I'm fine, had to call some people who lived next to the intelligence HQ and army bases, luckily they're fine too. And as for people working, some people stayed home, but if there isn't a curfew people will continue their lives. This nation has been through half a dousin coups so especially the older generation would just brush it off as nothing special.\n\nI'm trying to answer as many questions as I can btw\n\n**EDIT 11: DISCLAIMER**\n\n**Some are suggesting that I am pro-coup simply because I criticized our governments way of apprehending this issue and what they are currently doing. This is not the case, I am very much against anything that would hurt the democratic process of Turkey. Just because I dislike Erdogan's administration does not mean I would see Turkey go 50 years back, plunging itself into instability to get rid of him. The people elected Erdogan and this *must* be respected. Furthermore, I mentioned the deaths of civilians at the hands of coup forces, had I been pro-coup I would obviously leave this out. I think most Turks, pro-AKP or not, agree with this.**\n\nedit 12: After a bit of consideration, I've decided to change some of the phrasing in this post so as to prevent further misunderstandings. Edit 11 stands as the only thing reflecting my personal view on the matter. Everything else is purely out of observation from a neutral point of view. I would like to stress that I have and had absolutely no intentions of scrutinizing the current Turkish administration, and that I fully respect and acknowledge the legitimacy of the democratically elected government of Turkey. Furthermore, I would like to stress that anything that suggested criticism or bias towards the elected government of Turkey was written in a state of shock and frustration.

All the government controlled TV channels were still broadcasting and high on propaganda too.\n\n2) Timing is funny. Friday night, stock exchange is closed, Monday everything back to normal. Also before midnight does not make sense at all for a coup attempt. We have a tradition of waking up to coups very very early in the morning too.\n\n3) The President Erdogan called people to rally in the streets, more importantly he invited everybody to the Airport which was interestingly significant. Why the Airport? Why not just the streets in general.\n\n4) All TV channels used the same rhetoric, a word 'Kalk\u0131\u015fma' which is rather an odd word for describing a failed coup attempt. Reminds me of \"Disorganized Labor\" of House of Cards. \n\n5) All the mosques started reciting prayer almost simultaneously. They made announces encouraging people to get out in the streets to protest too.\n\n6) People started receiving text messages to protest.\n\nPro government people are celebrating in the streets in a triumphant fashion. They will wake up victorius.\n\nErdogan will consolidate his power enormously and will justify every all of his unlawful actions from now on. Maybe can go for early elections and capitalize this, thus will be able to declare his Presidency or should I say Sultanate. \n\nWe are just fucked.",

All international agreements are still valid.  We hope that all of our good relationships with all countries will continue.\" [link](https://twitter.com/MikaelSkillt/status/754059286347677696/photo/1)\n\nEdit:\n7:00pm EST-  in the past few hours, it appears the coup has failed. Turkish intelligence and spokesmen for the government have declared that the coup had been repelled.  Several nations, including the US, have stated  that the people and the army should respect the democratically elected government of Turkey.

Interesting. [link](https://twitter.com/joshrogin/status/754075607764533248?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\nEdit 2: I'm just posting new updates as the come in.  This won't be resolved for some time but the coup force appears to be small and is resisted by civilians, the navy, and police.  The outlook actually does not look good\n\nedit 3:  8:30pm EST - Turkish soldiers have taken control of the media building that contains CNN Turkey and removed them from the studio. [link](https://twitter.com/CeylanWrites/status/754110342666543104?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)  Parliament has been bombed (not at this moment but earlier) and members are taking refuge in a bunker - there are injuries. [link](https://twitter.com/RT_com/status/754100297543389184?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\nedit 4: 8:40 pm EST -  The campaign leader for Edrogan and his 16 year old son have been killed by coup members.[link](https://twitter.com/DailySabah/status/754108089431752704?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)  Reports of large explosion at the Istanbul airport - unconfirmed if it was a bomb or sonic boom.\n\nedit 5: 9:14 pm EST - Hillary Clinton has come out and made a statement that we should respect the democratically elected government of Turkey and that a diplomatic solution should be sought. [link](https://twitter.com/Acosta/status/754121672278609920/photo/1?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\nedit 6:  9:15 pm EST - Edrogan is currently appearing on TV.  Press statement expected shortly.\n\nedit 7: 9:30 pm EST -  Edrogan says the General Secretary and Chief of General Staff are missing or captured.  Also asserts that the coup are taking orders from Pennsylvania where Edrogan's chief rival, Gulen, is based. [link](https://twitter.com/intlspectator/status/754124534488244226?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\nedit 8: Edrogan has declared the coup fighters as a terrorist organization.  He has also lied about apparent explosions in Mugla and Marmaris\n\nedit 9: 10:14 pm EST - just because I find it humorous - Boris Johnson refers to Edrogan as a goatfucker last May [link](https://twitter.com/ReformedBroker/status/754080832881430530?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\nedit 10: 10:19pm EST - [video from inside parliament during bombing](https://twitter.com/RT_com/status/754128409949855745?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\nErdogan also says Gulen sympathizers infiltrated government over 40 years [link](https://twitter.com/Stratfor/status/754129043725885442?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\nedit 11: Apparently his name is Erdogan, not Edrogan. Fuck it, it's staying\n\nedit 12: 10:30pm EST - updates seem to be slowing.  Long and short of what's happened over the past few hours:\n\n- Segment of Turkish military attempts a coup to over throw the Erdogan government due to beliefs that he is not upholding the secular vision of Ataturk who essentially founded the Modern version of Turkey.  The military has a right to do this under their constitution.\n\n- Erdogan was on holiday when the coup started.  He safely made it out of the hotel he was staying in before it was bombed.\n\n- Multiple nations including the US, Germany, Somalia, Qatar, and others have publicly condemned the coup and stated that we should respect the democratically elected government of Turkey.  Clinton has issued a statement similar and wants diplomatic solutions.  The EU is calling for a rapid restoration of the constitutional rights of Turkey (paraphrasing can't find the statement)\n\n- Attempting to seek asylum but was rejected by most every country, Erdogan landed in Turkey.\n\n- Turkish forces bombed parliament, took and lost the State broadcasted news and radio networks, took and lost CNN Turk, and continue offensives through out the country.\n\n- Erdogan blames his rival, Fethullah Gulen for the coup.  Gulen and his group, however, have issued a statement condemning the action.  Gulen is currently based in Pennsylvania, USA.  Erdogan also states he saw the coup coming and this is the reason for some of his recent actions.  Erdogan has called on the citizens of Turkey to go into the streets and fight against the army which has led to civilian casualties.\n\nNote that the coup does not have full support of the nation - police, navy, civilians, and even other segments of the army do not condone the action.\n\n- The campaign leader for Erdogan's election was reportedly killed on one of the bridges held by the military along with his 16 year old son.\n\nThe coup appears to have failed and journalists and other statesment believe this may strengthen Erdogan's power.  fighting does remain ongoing at this time and we will have more clear views on what's happening in the coming hours and days.  Be very aware that releases by governments or even coup forces can be extremely false to paint their side as the victor as part of the PR machine.  I've seen reports and snippets that the government is pushing out video from *other* civil uprisings in the Middle East and claiming it to be part of the incidents tonight.  Take everything with a grain of salt. I've tried to compile the best updates I can.\n\nedit 13: 10:36pm EST - reports of 42 dead in Ankara.  Mostly civilians. via /u/burakso\n\nedit: 11:15pm EST - Bulk of fighting sounds like it's over.  Police forces from the government are doing searches of the city likely to find conspirators and root out remaining coup forces that have yet to be taken into custody.  Questions remain as to who were performing attacks in Marmaris and other cities like Bostanci, but there aren't many new updates so I'm checking out.  I'll be up for a while still so I'll update if anything else is happening.\n\nThe sun should now be up in Ankara. Stay safe out there.\n\nedit 14:  11:23pm EST - The Navy has allegedly joined the coup and switched sides.  [link](https://twitter.com/DEFCONWS/status/754149105476132865).\n\nedit 15: 11:30pm EST - still cannot confirm if Navy switched sides. @DEFCONwarningsystem is the only source I currently find that has this as an update and they are unsure themselves [link](https://twitter.com/DEFCONWS/status/754155811119607808?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet)\n\nThey have confirmed, however, that the Istanbul Strait has been closed to all ship traffic, including the Russian Fleets in the Black Sea [link](https://twitter.com/DEFCONWS/status/754153062298550272).  Can't imagine this is going to bode well for markets in the area.\n\nNo link available, but attacks on parliament are still ongoing according to Rueters\n\nedit 16: still cant find another source to corroborate Navy joining coup.  Anyone got anything on it?\n\nedit 17: 11:54 pm EST - courtesy /u/vrichthofen, [image of soldiers surrendering](https://imgur.com/RzsIx87)\n\nedit 18: 12:36am EST - Reuters reports that they received a statement from pro-coup forces that they are still determined and fighting.  Other sources do demonstrate that there are groups surrendering so this might just be smaller disturbances in the city, as stated by government sources.\n\nStill zero corroboration on the Navy joining coup forces. Once again, take these notes with a grain of salt. Anything coming from either side could be heavily propagandized\n\nedit 19: 1:32 am EST - Last update as I need some sleep.  Coup forces still appear to be in control of the armed forces website and are issuing statements that they will continue fighting and combat against anyone who opposes the coup [link](https://imgur.com/8N95p41).  Current estimates of injured stand at more than 1k people in Ankara and Istanbul hospitals with at least 60 dead according to the Red Cross.  Reports of approx 750 soldiers taken into custody. Chief of Staff was rescued by government forces from coup forces at an airbase.\n\nThe Gov continues to throw accusations at Fethullah Gulan and his organization. Gulen continues to deny.  Bulgarian forces are boosting border patrols at this time and more nations and organizations are piling on the \"respect democratic elections\" train - now including Canada and Turkish Air. Fighting in Ankara appears to be continuing and the gov could be pushing heavy propaganda about being in control. People on the outside will have a hard time knowing what's what until the dust settles but previous reports on government control are looking more shaky. \n\nedit 20: 2:45pm EST - As of today, 265 are dead, 1.5k+ injured, 3k soldiers arrested, 2.7k **judges** arrested.  Do not trust the Turkish government media, especially their calls on the US to extradite Gulen and naming him as a terrorist.  Egypt has blocked a UN resolution to condemn the coup in Turkey.  What many were fearing last night seems to be coming to fruition - Erdogan is using this (legitimate or false) coup as an opportunity to consolidate power and push even farther to authoritarian style theocracy.  The future of a secular and free Turkey is in doubt, at least in the short term.  ",

I'm a bit tired, and I need to take a break. Please note this is still not the whole story. I definitely missed some points of view, as some angry commenters reminded me without providing me any sources to back up other sides to the story. I did my best to find non-wiki sources, sometimes that didn't work. There's still a few questions that remain unanswered, I think the best you can do is keep your eyes on the news! We'll probably need to wait a few hours for everything to clear up anyway.\n\nEdits: Alright! So some great posts, I recommend reading (and I'll be around asking more questions to everyone). But in case you came here for the tl;dr:\n\n[The *ex*-current President is this guy Erdogan.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recep_Tayyip_Erdo%C4%9Fan) He was elected in a democratic vote in 2014. Prior to this, he was their Prime Minister. Turkey's terms last 5 years. Since then, he's passed some laws trying to move himself towards [singular rule and changing the constitution](http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2015/11/aide-erdogan-push-constitutional-change-151104165401294.html) (thanks /u/GeneralUranuz ) . He's also been accused of helping ISIS and a bunch of other policies that support a non-secular state.\n\n/u/TriggeredRedditors says:\n\n>It should be noted that Erdogan is an Islamist that wanted to implement full on Sharia Law in Turkey, yet Turkey tends to be more secular than other Islamic countries and only 12% of the population support Sharia Law.\n\nI found a source for the 12% fact, see [here](http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2013/05/turkey-shariah-law-islamists-paranoia.html)\n\n/u/LascielCoin says:\n>Atat\u00fcrk built the modern, \"western\", and very secular Turkey we all know and love. The military promised to keep his dreams alive.\n\nThe military believes itself to [defend secularism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_Turkey#Military_involvement_in_politics) as its first goal. They've overthrown a lot of Presidents when they feel they're overstepping their bounds or getting away from secularism (Wikipedia lists at least 3 - 4 coups if I'm remembering correctly, so this isn't necessarily \"new\"). The Turkish people are generally supportive of these coups. \n\n**The critical issue:**\n\nPeople are divided on whether or not Erdogan was (a) elected democratically and (b) even if he was, whether or not this takeover is 'democratic' in the sense of Turkish Democracy. \n\nLots of people point to [potential election rigging](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2016/02/15/were-there-irregularities-in-turkeys-2015-elections-we-used-our-new-forensic-toolkit-to-check/). Others say it was a fair vote and this is against democracy.\n\n Others point out (sorry I missed your /u/'s) that this isn't necessarily bad - Erogdan was voted in with 51% of the vote. The US Constitution needs 67% to change it. The military in some ways is this extra 16%. They protect Turkey from changing drastically by one President. (main point to /u/ribnag). Others have likened them to the U.S. Supreme Court. \n\nStill others state that this is against democracy. The voting was fair. Turkey in the 70s is not Turkey in the 21st century. If Turkey wants a Islamic leader, they deserve to get it. It is not the military's right to decide the future of Turkey. \n\n/u/drunkenmormon:\n>ELI5 ANSWER:\n>Turkey's military does not answer to its president like many other countries. They serve to maintain the vision of the country's founder.\n>The current president of Turkey has been pushing more and more islamist-focused laws (control of the media, things like that). This goes against the secular-focus of the country's founding.\n>The military has decided the president needs to be removed, and have staged a coup to accomplish this. This is not unique in Turkey's history, their military has done this a few times in the past for the same reasons. Presumably, the military's goal is to put someone more secular in power of the government.\n>The police in Turkey work for the government. So they are fighting against the military currently.\nThanks to /u/clawless for this info\n\n\n**Other Questions!**\n\n* Was the campaign over Erdogan secular or Islamic? \n\nMy reading on my own says Secular, though [here's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justice_and_Development_Party_(Turkey)) a wiki link to his party and [here's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recep_Tayyip_Erdo%C4%9Fan_presidential_campaign,_2014) a wiki link to his campaign. For a better source, [The Brooking's Institute has this paper defining The AKP party](http://www.brookings.edu/research/papers/2012/04/24-turkey-new-model-taspinar), thanks /u/myassholealt ! \n\n* Why don't these coups interfere with Turkey's NATO membership? Answered! Strategic politics.\n\n/u/mspires\n>As to the reason this coup doesn't interfere with NATO membership is because the United States tries very hard not to call it a coup, using other phrases such as political readjustment, because if they call it literally a coup they have to cut political ties, by not saying the word coup they are using a loophole that allows them to maintain treaties.\n\n* Though I think that leads to the larger question, why does Turkey matter so much to NATO membership? I think answering this also better answers the above. \n\n/u/ARoyaleWithCheese\n>To the US, Turkey's NATO membership is critical due to their strategical position near Russia.\n\n/u/pdrocker1\n>More specifically, their \"strategic position\" is that they control the Bosporus strait and the Dardanelles, meaning they can completely control Russian access to the Mediterranean Sea, and therefore a very important access point for a port near the Atlantic, as St. Petersburg freezes in the winter, and Kaliningrad is just an exclave that they have to get goods through Lithuania and Belarus anyways\n\n\n/u/woodbear \n>Turkey has one of the largest military forces in NATO.\n\n/u/s1704\n>it is in missile range of most of the Eurasian land mass e.g. missiles launched from Turkey could hit London or Moscow.\nI thought that might be it. \n\n**Unanswered Questions Include:**\n\n* Military who? Who leads the military? Who decides when to rebel?\n\nI should edit in here : I've had a few people comment that (a) Erdogan has worked to replace leaders of the army with his own, so that this coup shouldn't last and (b) The lack of a clear leader hints the army is divided, which also says this will not last. Neither of these have any sources, but neither does half my post, so YMMV. Update: Sources are coming from the Turkish government (not military) that the coup has already been defeated and that they have support of the people [source](https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2016/jul/15/turkey-coup-attempt-military-gunfire-ankara).\n\n/u/wintersmoke\n>the news is currently speculating that what we're looking here is a mutiny, not a coup.... Previous coups in Turkey have been swift, but this time we have people are protesting in Istambul (the economic heart of Turkey -- think New York City), while the military forces involved in the coup are ensconced in Ankara (the governmental heart of Turkey -- think Washington, DC). Routing the rebellious forces could be very, very bloody.\n\n* How will this effect my trip to Turkey in 3 weeks?\n\n* Why does Obama support Erdogan? [USNews- Obama released statement in support of Erdogan](http://www.usnews.com/news/politics/articles/2016-07-15/obama-all-parties-in-turkey-should-support-erdogan-govt) Especially since the Military seems to support a more Western ideal? I imagine the answer will be similar to NATO's answer above. \n\n/u/wintersmoke\n>1) Though Erdogan has not been a fantastic ally, he has made some reluctant improvements recently (making peace with Israel, etc). 2) The country as a whole is a critical partner for the US thanks to its role in NATO and the situation is made increasingly dire thanks to its proximity to Syria (it's the choke point through which all Syrian refugees flow) and Iraq. 3) The US has also sunk a lot of time and resources into bringing Erdogan into the fold as an ally in the War on Terror, etc., and from the beginning he was seen to be a moderate Muslim leader that could serve as a template for future moderate Muslim regimes across the Middle East (before he went all authoritarian on people, anyway).\n>Add all that to the not unreasonable desire to ensure the wishes of democracy are preserved and it's not surprising the US is reluctant to throw in with the rebels.\n\n* How will this affect the Kurds? /u/fuck-dat-shit-up  and I believe he's referencing the fact that Erdogan [is not very friendly towards Kurds](http://www.worldaffairsjournal.org/article/trouble-turkey-erdogan-isis-and-kurds). \n\n[A short Vox article summarizing everything](http://www.vox.com/2016/7/15/12204172/turkey-coup-erdogan-military) courtesy of /u/Dakar-A",

    "body": "ELI5 for the foreigner:\n\nThere are 3 main factions within the military, though one has significantly faded when Erdogan wiped them out with a giant case where the \"suspected\" military leaders were accused with false evidence. The case is called \"Ergenekon\", you can find many documents in English. These were the \"republican\" leaders, who believed in sovereignity and secularism, with the military as their protector. And they were also the smartest and most educated&competent as you might guess how a corrupt islamist officer would react in a war.\n\nThe others are Erdogan's ultra-islamist-barely-educated raw manpower, and soldiers belonging to Fethullah G\u00fclen's islamic cult.\n\nErdogan's faction pretty much took over after the Ergenekon case, though some G\u00fclen cultists remained. The difference between them is that while both are islamic, G\u00fclen's cult is a bit more relaxed in terms of faith and more oriented in money. It is a well-known fact  that G\u00fclen is supported by US(the guy is living in Pennyslvenia).\n\nErdogan and G\u00fclen were BFF's until recently when they became enemies for shady reasons. Most people argue that it was Erdogan's lust of power, as many of G\u00fclen's cultists were already infiltrated within the Turkish bureucracy.\n\nThe founders of the Republic, those who want full secularism and sovereignity are considered a minority now, though that is not exactly the case.\n\nBack onto the topic: Whenever something goes wrong, Erdogan blames G\u00fclen for it, whether it is relevant or not. And of course, he blamed G\u00fclen for the coup attempt. This is however not entirely unfounded as Kerry's statement gives you some insight. \n\nThe second largest army(standing 675K men as of February 2016, 3M+ when mobilized, close to 15M under emergency conscription law) of NATO is divided between fanatic islamists and cultists.\n\nThere are 2 theories: \n\n1. This is an attempt at overthrowing Erdogan and his government.\n\n2. This is orchestrated by Erdogan to increase his support and pass the presidency law that he is obsessed with in an emergency meeting. While this may sound wtf, time after time he proved he is nothing short of killing his own citizens for his delusions.\n\nAs of now, both are not proven.\n\nCoup lacks the support of the entire army, which is one of the main reasons it has stalled. Erdogan's main force is the police, whom he generously invested in since his coming of power. A special forces squad has been taken into custody by the police, that should tell you something.\n\nCommanders of Air, Naval and Army forces all denounced the act, as this is assumed to be a colonel-level attempt. Not many soldiers are deployed, though there are news coming that they have taken an aggressive stance. We know for a fact that Air force is bombing the police stations. And as I'm writing this, The Turkish National Assembly has been hit. \n\nErdogan has called for \"Ezans\" throughout the country, which basically are prayers broadcasted from the Mosques 5 times a day. It is also a symbol of Islam. He also called his supporters to go out and flood the streets, while ironically he did everything in his power to destroy protesters 3 years ago with extreme use of tear gas and highly-pressurised water.\n\nPeople's feelings are mixed. While in here(\u0130zmir, the most secular voterbase of Turkey, the place Erdogan is still struggling to get after 14 years), there are people supporting the coup, but we are divided. Most people that have seen the 1980 coup are still alive, and they very well know what it means. We want Erdogan to go(death, escape whatever), and election after election and shady vote counting, combined with the traidition of nation-wide power outages during elections we know it will not happen with democracy. Hell in last June he couldn't even get the majority in the Parliament, and declared re-election 4 months after and magically got the majority. \n\nPeople simply don't know what to feel. If this is a play orchestrated by Erdogan, the presidency system will most likely come into effect next week, guy is obsessed with it. If the coup fails, which it seems to, same thing will happen. Also there is a chance that Turkey may get out of NATO, now that Erdogan will treat the west as the enemy.\n\nEducation is important people. This is what happens when it is not prioritised. \n\nEdit: There seems to be a small misconception about Erdogan.\n\nErdogan does not work for his country, only for himself. Whatever he does, whatever he says is to his own ends. He already sold most of our national companies for unimaginably low prices, only to hoard the comission or occasionally the money itself. \n\nA small example: Due to the embargo Iran has been selling their oil through Turkey, with Turkey getting a commission out of it.\n\nTotal comission is known to be around 5 billion Euros.\n\nThe money is missing.",

Certain news reporters, government entities, and other related parties that have something to lose are throwing out damage control statements. Things like \"It is a small group within the military,\" \"This will be over shortly,\" \"We must protect Turkey's democracy.\" Yet I've heard and seen bridges taken over, parliament and the #1 news agency are all shut down. Not quite sure I would say this is over. Given those peoples position though, I imagine they have to say those things.\n\nMeanwhile Ergodan is turning the people against the coup by calling the military members terrorists. This could be him doing a bit of social engineering so the public can help secure his power.\n\nI don't think the people know exactly what the military's end goal is here and thats going to be problematic as it will be easy to paint them as the enemy. I dont know what type of statement they made, but I hope it was concise. Because I have a feeling the people will tend to side with the president initially at least.\n\n**Edit after more observation**  \nIt seems that there are varying degrees of public response across the area. There are people fleeing scenes with bodies on the ground. Other areas show civilians on top of tanks. I imagine this was due to inconsistent degrees of aggressive response from the military. Those that ended in a few casualties left a strong enough message to get them to flee. Those that didn't were taken over. I'm guessing the military doesn't want to hurt civilians, but it's clear that line is going to be tested. Any deaths caused by military will be spun against them given Ergodans \"terrorist\" claims.\n\nKeep in mind political leaders all around the world wont exactly be fond of the world knowing that overthrow or coups can be successful. With this on display for the world it's going to be expected that most authoritative powers will downplay this as much as possible.\n\nThe waters are muddy, take everything as possibility not truth. \n",

The military would have known exactly where the president was and executed him on sight. The power companies siezed and utilities shut down.

She has been around since the final years of Ataturk and has seen all the previous coups so it wasn't a surprise that she was very scared when things started. I am watching news and redditing constantly where the majority of the media is reporting the coup has been unsuccesful. I will have a wedding next week (which is very weird in current climate i admit) and then we will try to find a job suitable for both of us in more civilized parts of the world. We are both teachers of English language. We will also start surfing for financially stable jobs but if anyone can help us on our search, help would be appreciated.\n\nEdit: I truly wish i could get my first reddit gold on a comment i made not out of worry for my own country and life of my family but for something on a much more colorful and beautiful note but thank you stranger, wherever you are!",

Would like to give some insight to those that may not understand what has happened in Turkey. \n\nThe Army is unlike many other nations, in which they intervene when the government stray away from the ideologies that Turkey was built upon. Erdogan has constantly lied to people and he is as good as a manipulator gets. \n\nErdogan has been slowly but surely turning the country in to a loyal pet, what I mean by that is through his policies, he makes it seem like he is giving the people rights and safety when in fact doing the opposite. You can't even mention his name negatively these days without going to jail. \n\nI could go on and on but an example I'd like to give people that really stuck with me through this whole ordeal is 2013 Geza protests. It was similar to the Wall Street protests in the US except the people protesting wanted him to leave. He furiously stated \"Those who leave their homes are enemy of the state\" Now keep in mind this was a peaceful protest. Now three years later, while he is on his plane looking for a place to seek asylum, he goes on facetime with a local news station and asks civilians to go out in to the streets and fight against the army. Yes, unarmed civilians to fight armed soldiers. \n\nThese casualties could have been easily avoided had he not done that but does he care? absolutely not. Now the government is strongly considering bringing back the death penalty for the soldiers that have surrendered. \n\nMake no mistake, Erdogan will use this to tighten his power hold over the country until people wake up and we see something similar to the fate that Gaddafi faced. By then, it will be way too late.\n\n",

This goes against the secular-focus of the country's founding.\n\nThe military has decided the president needs to be removed, and have staged a coup to accomplish this. This is not unique in Turkey's history, their military has done this a few times in the past for the same reasons. Presumably, the military's goal is to put someone more secular in power of the government.\n\nThe police in Turkey work for the government.

    "body": "Ataturk thought he had an answer to that question: the military. Everyone loves talking about how Turkey was designed as a secular state, but how is it supposed to stay constitutionally secular with a fairly religious population?\n\nFor Ataturk, secularism was supposed to be the military's responsibility. Whenever a despot threatened to dismantle the constitution or act against the nation's fundamental secular principles, the military could swoop in, temporarily suspend the government, and swiftly hold new, legitimate, democratic elections.\n\nThat's been the impetus behind most of Turkey's previous military coups. That's not to say Ataturk's idea is any good, or that this current coup is working in that spirit. But it's crucial context.",
