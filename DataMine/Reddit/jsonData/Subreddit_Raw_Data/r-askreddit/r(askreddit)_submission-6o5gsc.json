Matt Parker from standupmaths is a frequent participant, so if you like Numberphile then give standupmaths a shot.\n\nVsauce (and 2 and 3) are fun but frenetic shows on interesting random things, mostly science related.\n\nVeritasium is full of short episodes either explaining cool science things or visiting interesting places related to science.\n\nCGPGrey is in the same vein as Vsauce and Veritasium, though it delves into non science topics as well. It's animated in a simple but effective manner.\n\nCrashCourse has 20-40 episode playlists at 10 or so minutes apiece about various topics like philosophy, chemistry, and mythology. Very high production value and very entertaining.\n\nSmarter Every Day is a science demonstration channel that gets a lot of attention. Personally the southern accent is a little off putting for me.\n\nSorry for lack of links, I'm on mobile.",

He has enough money to work on the series full time now, but reaching $10k (it's at $7.5k right now) would allow him to rent a studio (he currently records at his parents' house) and pay a small crew. His videos are so professional and of such high quality I always assumed he had major financial backing of some kind. I'm backing at $15 a month if anyone wants to ask me a question about the rewards.\n\nThe 'debunking' aspect of his videos is actually pretty secondary to me. I usually don't know the video in question and don't really care whether it's real/fake. The quality of the presentation, the creativity, the humor, the meditations on skepticism, etc. are what keep me coming back. The debunked videos are just something to hang all that on. I'd be really interested to see the ways that he might branch out in the future. Sort of the same way the Plinkett videos allowed RedLetterMedia to branch out and produce several different series and entertaining one-offs (incidentally, he's a big fan of theirs as well).\n\nEDIT: [Link](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/6l1ghz/im_captain_disillusion_the_titular_hero_of_and/) to his AMA from a couple weeks ago.\n\nEDIT2: Link to his [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_LLMAZ8hGs) announcing his Patreon page.",

Thanks in advance.\n* [Jordan Peterson's Psychology Lectures](https://www.youtube.com/user/JordanPetersonVideos) - Dr. Peterson is a professor and clinical psychologist. His lectures span from how values, including beliefs about good and evil, regulate emotion and motivation and Personality and Its Transformations, to topics of general psychological relevance, including the meaning of music, the significance of hero mythology, and the structure of the world as represented in religion.\n* If Jordan Peterson lectures are too long for you then I suggest, [bite-sized philosophy](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCo9QgwWCNEhDxL1gH-jxa8Q).

Real Engineering is pretty straightforward; he likes to dissect the engineering feats and mechanics that power the world with a lot of his own self-created images and diagrams. Wendover Productions is a little more general, ranging from explanations as to why certain things are the way they are and how they became with a big focus on transport/travel.\n* [Welsh Labs](https://www.youtube.com/user/Taylorns34/) has two really engaging video series (about 15 videos each) about imaginary numbers and computer learning.

    "body": "When all three started biting into that soap bar I literally gagged and was shouting at my screen, \"you sick fucks...!\"\n\nThey got me so good.\n\nedit: Also, holy shit Dan, the one where he finds some drug dealer's stash and *the guy is in the house* had my eyes watering. You knew he was okay because the video got uploaded, but that was tense and scary as fuck. His videos do not give a good impression of Baltimore.\n\nedit2: Sorry people, it looks like he took the video down because he was getting a ton of negative messages from people about it being staged/fake. Summary as best I can recall; \n\n(Baltimore, nighttime. Exterior: Rundown multi-level house that may have been divided into rental units. The property is overgrown and heavily deteriorated).\n\n- Dan circles the property looking for a way in. All doors and windows have been boarded up. He eventually finds a heavily weathered wooden ladder propped against an unsealed 2nd story window. He expresses hesitation since he didn't see another way in or out, but after testing his weight against the ladder, decides to go in. \n\n- The interior is pitch black; the only light comes from the one attached to his camera. There is a lot of what you typically see in extremely worn down buildings; the walls are falling apart, the floor is absolutely covered in debris, there is junk and destroyed furniture everywhere. Occasionally there is a distant noise, but this is not unusual for such a location. Dan comments that it might be rats. \n\n- For a time he does his usual UrbEx deal of just walking around, but during this time he repeatedly stops and listens. \n\n- Dan comes to a room with a window facing the street. 2 men are walking down the sidewalk on the opposite side of the street. Their voices bounce off the buildings around them, and echo back to the house Dan is filming from. He seems reassured by the thought that he's just been hearing the voices of people outside. \n\n- He eventually finds himself at a stairway. He pauses one last time, seeming to hear something, and calls out. After hearing nothing in response, he starts up the stairs. It is immediately visible in the dark that there is something out of place; at the top of the stairs is a bright patch of very clean lime green. He approaches and finds one of those reusable grocery bags, loaded up with short term provisions; canned and boxed food goods, several glass bottles of juice, and on top, a clear plastic to-go container filled with neatly bundled baggies of what looks like chunks of amber resin. He picks this up to get a better look, but puts it back immediately when an agitated male voice calls out from somewhere deeper in the house. \n\n- Dan flees and ducks into a nearby room (bathroom?) while covering the light on his camera. You can hear someone walking around; whoever it is seems to notice that their bag has been touched, and starts shouting things like \"WHO THE FUCK IS IN HERE\" \"I SWEAR TO GOD I'M NOT PLAYING\" and moving around with a lot of energy. Dan struggles to control his breathing, and can be heard whispering to his camera \"please leave, please leave\" (or other similar panicked phrases, it has been months since I saw this)\n\n- As soon as the footsteps retreat, he quickly leaves the bathroom. IIRC he takes a quick peek at the bag (still present) and the drugs have been removed. He bee-lines for the exit, intermittently covering his light to better hide his location. As he makes it outside, the sound of a barking dog grows nearer; though this may have been edited in. \n\nThe video ends with him making it off the property safely.",
