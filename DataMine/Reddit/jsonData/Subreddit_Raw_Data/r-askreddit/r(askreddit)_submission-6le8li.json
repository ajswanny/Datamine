I went above and beyond to prove it's me. \n\nEdit: because the news article doesn't have much/correct information.\n\nI had just got home from a bartending shift and was walking my dog. My neighbors across the street, who were gangbangers liked to harass anyone latino looking that walked by. They were drinking and I happen to walk up when they had a couple surrounded with knives, bats and some other various weapons. I had my bartending flashlight on me and shone it on them hoping they would run thinking I was the cops. this ended up being what saved me because they all threw their weapons as they ran. They quickly realized I wasn't a cop and came back but the couple had a quick second to get away. I ended up fighting them for quite some time. The police report and my neighbors (girls who thankfully grabbed my sweet golden retriever) said that I lasted for over a minute and was holding my own. Then  a cab driver tried to help by running some of them over. That separated me from the group and allowed one of them to pick up a 2x4 and crack me in the back of the head. Luckily a police officer drove by about the time they were dragging my unconscious body up the street and kicking me. When I woke up there was so much blood I thought I was dead and this was the afterlife. I looked up and realized from the expression on the 40 or so onlookers that I was not haha. This was the busy downtown area and the bars had just closed so their were a bunch of people who came to look what was going on and about 10 cop cars and an ambulance. I ended up with a broken eye socket, broken nose, two broken hands from fighting for so long, 40-50 stitches/staples in face and head. The victim's restitution find payed all my bills and the stiffest sentence handed out was 1 year and the guy got out almost a month after because he never posted bail. They only ended up arresting 3 guys. One I had knocked out, one was bleeding and they followed the trail to an unlocked parked car, and my neighbor who lived in the house across the street. The scariest part was the 4 days they waited to arrest my neighbor. Every Time detectives would come over the gangsters would hang out on their porch and stare at us talking on my porch.

    "body": "While we're on the subject of bird-related shenanigans...\n\nA little over a year ago I was homeless in the Bay Area. I'd spent the previous night in an illegal encampment/meth den; the next morning, as I got off the BART and walked into town I only just barely noticed I was about to step on something small and colorful. I looked down to see it was some kind of exotic bird. A cockatiel or small parrot, I wasn't sure. It was hobbling along the sidewalk outside of a new apartment complex; it must have been hurt because it wasn't flying away from me and only just barely walking. I figured it must have been someone's escaped pet. I looked around and there was no one else on the street and the closest apartment buildings had no open windows I could see.  \n\nDeciding I couldn't just leave it in case it was run over or a cat got it, I picked 'her' up and walked into the reception of the nearest apartment. I asked if anyone had reported a missing pet and they said no, and that tenants weren't allowed to have pets anyway. \n\nI stuck around outside the apartment for an hour or so, in case anyone came looking for her; I saw no one. After awhile I decided the best thing to do would be to get help from a veterinarian. I couldn't keep her myself, obviously, because I was homeless. I couldn't get to any rescue centers because I don't drive and from what I saw online, the closest ones were impossible for me to reach on foot. I figured a vet would be able to take her, on the off chance that someone had enquired about their missing bird, or at least one of the staff would be willing to drop her off at a shelter for me.  \n\nI set off on a long walk towards the closest vet; I must have looked a right sight - a mildly bedraggled, possibly homeless man, wandering around with an exotic bird in his hand. I saw a lot of rubber-necking and people at traffic lights actually rolling down their windows to ask about her. \n\nOn the journey, the bird and I actually made friends; I'd been holding her cupped in my hands in case she tried to fly off, and she'd been nipping and biting my fingers. I sat down to unpack some food for us and we shared a stale sandwich and some water. Tentatively, I opened my hand, expecting her to go crazy or try to fly off, but amazingly she just maneuvered herself to [perch on my finger](http://imgur.com/55rlBz6) and seemed content there with me. \n\nSo we set off again: one hobo and his bird. When we made it to the vet's a few hours later they explained they couldn't help, and were unwilling to take her as it went against their policies. They suggested I try the others vets in town to see if they could do anything more. The next couple I went to said the exact same thing. \n\nFlummoxed, I started to worry a little; what the hell was I going to do? It was early in the year so nights got very cold. I was barely making it sleeping fully dressed under a winter blanket. AFAIK, birds don't handle the cold very well, and I couldn't put her under the covers with me for fear of squashing her in my sleep. I couldn't put her in a box or anything in case she wandered off and/or got attacked by a cat. I messaged some friends to see if they could take her but they were all unwilling or able, and suggested I go to a vet. Birdy, in the meantime, didn't panic and [kept her cool](http://imgur.com/PoVVBx3).\n\n\nAs the day dragged on, I managed to visit the last of the vets on my list, and they all said the same thing as the others. It was now nightfall, so my options were non-existent. I decided I'd just have to pull an all-nighter at the local Safeway caf\u00e9, and I'd figure something out the next day. \n\nAs I was sat in the empty dining area, feeding her some bird food, one of the staff was walking past and did a double-take. \"Is...is that a bird? In here?\" I thought she was going to ask me to leave, but she came over intrigued. I told her my story (avoiding the fact that I was homeless) and she had the strangest response - she explained that she was an exotic bird aficionado and offered to take the bird in! She whipped out her phone and showed me all the cages and birds she'd had over the years. She said her shift was finishing up in an hour and that if I could stick around till then, she would take birdy off me and put her in the pet carrier she had in her car. As I didn't have anything better to do and I wanted birdy to be safe, I stuck around. Sure enough, the lady comes by later and we go to her car. She has a small pet carrier in there and tells me tomorrow's her day off, so she'll take birdy to the vets for a checkup and some treatment. I said one last goodbye to my new [feathered friend](http://imgur.com/wDVKSoq), thanked the lady for her help, and trudged off to my dumpster.\n\n\nThus, the adventure came to an end. I was actually sad to part ways with the bird; maybe it was just the company. But I was happy she went to a caring home, with someone knowledgeable about birds. Whenever I went into the store after that, the lady was always happy to let me know how the bird was doing. As of six months after I found her, the bird was happy healthy, and able to fly again.\n\n\nTL;DR, homeless man finds abandoned exotic bird, roams streets with it, gets a lot of weird looks, coincidentally bumps into random store worker that loves birds, a happy ending for all.",

(photo)\n\n[13 dangerous prisoners scaled the rubble and ran to freedom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iC1RPMQ9DZk) (Video).\n\nSoon after my dad got a call on the phone and told us to turn on the television.  \nWhy? - It was our wheel loader that had been stolen from our family company (a gravel pit) and been used for what is to this date still Denmarks most spectacular prison break.\n\nI remember my dad swearing and cursing (like many dads he can have quite a temper) and being very upset about 3 things.  \n\n1. Some bastard had stolen our wheel loader and rammed it into a fucking wall and caused major damage to it!\n2. That bastard had also rammed through our company gate, completely trashing it. (Which BTW was totally unnecessary because the dirt barriers that surround the gravel pit keep cars and trucks from passing them, but a wheel loader can easily scale those, so the thief could just have driven around the gate and over the barrier)   \n3. As we could now see on live television the police was now driving the wheel loader and using it to clean up the scene - potentially causing further damage to it's damaged hydraulics.\n\nIn the months after the prison break, people at my college and elsewhere kept asking me mainly two questions :  \n*Could I drive that thing?* - Yes.  \n*Did I drive that thing* - No!\n\nThe prisoners were all caught again after only a couple of weeks and the mastermind behind it, a notorious breakout king, only lasted 6 days outside the walls before he was caught again. He has since then escaped that same prison 3 further times in different ways and has broken out of prison 22 times in total.\n\n[American TV also covered it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_omYVpSxrw) (Video) and tells the story.

It was about 3 feet tall and and maybe 20-25 feet long, maybe. The fuselage/cockpit was just behind the camera and was overgrown with what I thought was the cockpit barely sticking out.

    "body": "Posted about this once before. Got pretty drunk with friends and was driven home. Couldn't sleep, apparently switched on my PC and started looking at government surplus auctions. Woke up the next morning and found that I had several emails notifying me that I had ten days to drive out to my local Navy/Dept. of Defense storage facility to collect my [Baggage Scanning X-Ray Machine.](http://imgur.com/a/ZARQj)\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n**EDIT**: Tons of questions regarding this! Can't reply to everyone, here are a few common answers for you guys:\n\n1.There was no radioactive material inside - the X-rays were generated electronically.\n\n2.Unfortunately, it never worked 100% correctly, so after trying to fix it for a few years, I broke it down for lead scrap last fall because it was 800lbs of immobile mass in a crowded garage, and I could no longer keep it around. I decided not to sell it, because I was terrified of whomever buying it having the wrong uses in mind.\n\n3.All said and done, this cost $200.00 max, including fuel and tolls. I can't recall the exact figure because it was a while back.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n**Edit 2:** Alot of people are asking what sites to use for surplus auctions, so here are a few: https://gsaauctions.gov/, http://www.govliquidation.com/, http://www.go-dove.com/en/, http://www.govplanet.com/, http://www.ironplanet.com/ There are many other auction services out there for various regions too. Most large cities have surplus auctions at regular intervals, as do most states. Sometimes certain regions only have in-person auctions, which can be a good time if you've never been to one. Best to consult Google for those.",

Miller once hoisted me up and carried me out of a building.\n\n[Proof](http://imgur.com/a/64TgX)\n\nEDIT: Alright I wasn't sure if adding context would ruin the story or anything but here it is. So basically I'm a college student on our school's programming board. This past year I was able to plan my first large scale comedy show and I chose to bring T.J. Miller. The show was great and what we do after every show is let the entire board (around 20ish people) get in a group photo with the talent, and the person who organized the event (in this case me) gets an individual picture. After we took the photo, T.J. looked around and said \"Wait, is YesLikeTheJeans the person who's responsible for bringing me?\" and when everyone said yes he said \"Let's hoist him in the air!\" After they carried me out of the building he yelled \"Now let's throw him in the bushes!\" which was funny because a police officer was right there, and after T.J. Noticed he said \"Never mind, set him down!\"\\\n\nT.J. was a super nice guy and very down to earth. As I was walking him back to his car he said that he was going to smoke a cigarette and asked if I wanted to stay and talk to him (which of course I did). The conversation was directed toward me and he asked me what I studying in school, about my family, and what I wanted to do with the rest of my life. He seemed genuinely interested and when I told him I wanted to pursue a career in television/ comedy writing he talked to me about tips on how to succeed in such a difficult field. Here I am, standing in an empty parking lot in the middle of the night, talking to one of my favorite people in the world, discussing my future. It was definitely one of the coolest moments of my life, and T.J. is one of the nicest people alive.\n\n[\nAlso, I found some more pictures.](http://imgur.com/a/W6OF1)\n\nI've also have pictures of some other cool people through either the programming board or just random interactions such as Ice-T, Bill Clinton, and Ray Romano, but those are different stories for a different day.",

I was thrown out of the car via passenger door (hip checked it open).  Never lost conciousness, and was walking around within a couple minutes after the accident.  \n\nRefused ambulance ride, but did go to hospital.  They released me after 20 hours, a plethora of tests, CT scans, MRI's and X-Rays and said that there is absolutely nothing wrong with me.  Gave me a bottle of pain killers and said that I\"m going to need those.  And need them I did......hurt like a mother fucker for weeks, if not months.  \n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/tBBIJpM.jpg\n\nThats me leaning against the car getting checked out by paramedics\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/5oKVuXl.jpg",

That was the end of a long running joke war, we quit at that point while we were still friends.\n\nhttp://imgur.com/a/z2C04\n\nedit: Added a few more pictures. Popping this all took close to a month, and we destroyed several air poppers in the process. We went to the local thrift store and were just buying old ones there to go towards the cause.\n\nedit 2: Here's some of the other pranks that led up to this.\n\nIt started with him sneaking a little bit of oil into my carburetor, and convincing me that my engine was about to go when it blew smoke everywhere (I had a 57 Ford at the time).\n\nLater, he played it off like my other friend (The one I'm shaking hands with in the picture) had done it, so we pulled a joke on him. He forgot his backpack at my house after school one day, so we ran up to the local liquor store, and bought every copy of Playgirl that they had. Actually, we ~~drug~~ dragged along my sister's friend, and had her buy them for us, lol. So we spent several hours cutting out pictures of naked guys and gluing them to every single picture in all of his text books. We also got a pair of lacy bright red panties, and clipped them to the bottom ring of his binder, so when he pulled his binder out in class those would come out with them. We did some other things to the backpack as well, but I don't remember the specifics. \n\nAny ways, he got the backpack from me before class the next morning. As he was having breakfast before class, another friend who missed class the day before asked if he could copy his notes, so he found the panties, which caused him to examine his backpack further. He wound up skipping all of his classes that day, and scraping a bunch of naked guys out of his books. This was in college, not high school.\n\nOne of the other pranks was we decorated the 64 Falcon with fishing bait. Anchovies everywhere, under his door handles, in the tail pipe, under his windshield wipers. And a big mackerel that we'd caught put on his radio antenna like an antenna topper.\n\nThere were dozens of other jokes over the course of a few years, but those are the main ones that I remember.",

We ended up having to take a detour off of the main highway we were on, due to a crash. Long story short, we were on this county road when I saw an owl hanging from one wing on a barb wire fence. I thought it was dead at first until I saw it flinch slightly. I told my co-worker to pull over, I ran to the back to get my leather gloves and ran in rescue of the owl. It was tangled in one of the barbs so I had to cut the wire with a shears. When finally freed, it practically fell into my arms as if I was its guardian. From there I brought it to the local DNR office. 'Twas a good day.\n\n[Pictures ](https://imgur.com/gallery/bfbhq) ",

    "body": "I work as a rocket launch photographer and I place cameras at the launchpads at Cape Canaveral. When I tell people that, they usually don't believe me, so I show them my photos. Sometimes they still don't believe me :)\n\nI captured this [closeup shot](http://i.imgur.com/vM5fugF.jpg) of the engine and solid rocket motors on the Delta IV Medium+ (5,4) rocket. \n\nNow for the sad part: The cameras are sound-triggered; the sound would kill anyone that close to the rockets. We setup cameras 12-24 hours before the launches and GTFO.\n\nI also photographed a launch [from a helicopter.](http://i.imgur.com/SxYggvw.jpg)\n\nI've got more launch/Florida-inspired photos on my [website](http://www.johnkrausphotos.com) and [Instagram, @johnkrausphotos](http://www.instagram.com/johnkrausphotos) if anyone's interested.\n\nFeel free to ask anything about the launches/cameras/setup/process.\n\n---\n\n**Some frequently asked questions:**\n\nHow does the camera not get destroyed?\n\n- Sometimes they do, but I'm lucky enough to have not had much gear destroyed. I've had one kit lens get pitted by exhaust and dirt at the launchpad, but those are cheap and easy to replace. For my closeup images, I use cheap entry-level Nikon DSLRs (that are still capable of taking great images).\n\n- I have my camera on top of tripod. Each leg of the tripod gets staked down with tent stakes to prevent the rocket or wind from knocking it over. I wrap the camera in a plastic bag to protect it from rain and the rocket.\n\n- [Here](http://i.imgur.com/Pnd8Y44.jpg) is an image I took of one of my camera setups.\n\nWhat settings did you use for the closeup image and how did you figure those out? Do you use auto mode?\n\n- 1/4000, f/13, ISO 100, 80mm on a crop sensor camera. Fully manual mode, no auto. I used some of my previous photos as reference and talked with some good friends who have been shooting similar images for awhile.\n\nHow far away are the cameras?\n\n- Depends on the launch. The camera that took the closeup image I linked above was about 100 yards from the rocket.\n\nHow'd you get started doing this?\n\n- I started photography about 2/2.5 years ago and shot launched from public locations for about a year. An accredited media outlet took me under their wing and I am credentialed through them, which grants me access to the launchpads at Cape Canaveral to setup cameras.\n\nWhy is this applicable to this post?\n\n- Because I tell people what they do and they don't believe me, so I show them the images.",

We thought nothing of it until a few weeks later, after the trip had ended.\n\nMy friend who lives in China emails us to say we were on the front cover of the newspaper.

(I left because I was severely bullied in school and didn't want to deal with it any longer)\n\nI had to become a vegan while I was working with them and quickly discovered how cult-like the group was. The leader of the group was the Alpha and had multiple wives. The other males were very strange guys, and I don't think they were able to take girlfriends.\n\nMy job was the riskiest of all. I was essentially used as bait. All day I would prepare the meat for animal consumption, which would leave me smelling of beef and chicken guts. The uniform I was required to wear included a feathered hat. The lions and tigers were trained to be drawn to the feather. I was placed out in the crowd so the cats would look into the crowd. If any cat were to get free of their handler, they most likely would attack me rather than other guests because of my smell and the feather.\n\nI ended up leaving the group and going home after a friends parent saw me at one event. Here is the picture she sent to my parents telling them what I was doing. http://imgur.com/pUDBfgc They came and convinced me to come home, where I slowly became unbrainwashed. I went back to school and got a job at a grocery store pushing carts at 16. \n\nI still put it down as previous experience on resumes as a conversation point.",

    "body": "I was struck by lightning, at a Boy Scout camp, which I find rather shocking.\n\nEvery time I mentioned this as my \"fun fact\" for highschool or college, people instantly called BULL. Needless to say, I often had to send people links to the local or national news coverage of the Boy Scout camp I was at. (https://www.google.com/amp/boston.cbslocal.com/2013/06/24/nh-boy-scouts-hospitalized-after-lightning-strike/amp/ )\n\nI have pictures of me recovering in the ER on my cloud drive (at work) and I'll post them on imgur when I get home. I have spiderweb burns on my heart and on my arms and feet.\n\nHere's what happened:\n\nI went to a National Youth Leadership Training camp for Boy Scouts in June of 2013. On the first full day of camp, we were coming back from a mud training course and went to hit the showers. While showering my fellow campers and I heard the campwide alarm go off. We all rushed to get changed as quick as we could but then we heard a knock on the door telling us that this was only for the main camp and that we were not to respond to this drill because we are in a seperate program.\n\nWhen we got back to our campsite, we got ready for dinner (you have to wear full uniform) and we're gathering around our metal tables that were set up in this classroom-style setting under a tarp with metal folding chairs surrounding the tables. About 2 minutes later there is a huge breeze and the sky turns from bright and clear to the darkest sky I've ever seen. It was darker than a normal night, and the clouds flickered with an ominous glow. At this point the coordinator for our campsite (we were one of 3) tells the ~30 scouts and 3 adults to gather under the tarp to wait out the rain. The wind picks up heavily and then we are told that if a direction is yelled to run in that direction because trees are in danger of falling. Several seconds later everything stops. Things really do go in slow motion... It's really weird.\n\nAll of a sudden I hear everyone start screaming this blood curdling scream and I'm locked into my chair which is nudged up against this tree. I don't remember passing out, but I remember the screams echoing as they got louder and I felt an intense heat course through my veins and my hair stand on end. It sounded like someone shot a gun next to my ear, however, it was so loud I went deaf. The blinding light streaked through my vision and I felt myself fall forward onto the metal table and bump my chest against the metal rim, sending another wave of heat through me.\n\nI was blind for ~ 1-3 minutes and deaf for about 5 but eventually eberyone came down; then we noticed our scars. Instantly an emergency call was made and myself and ~6 other kids were rushed to the lobby of main camp to be evaluated because we had the worst scarring (mine was over my heart, and I was having trouble breathing). I only remember that I had a temperature of 100.7 F and that my heart was racing (because why would it not after hundreds if thousands of volts?). \n\nI'm rushed to the hospital, many tests are done, and I'm released at 3am (roughly 9 hours later). In the end 26 scouts went to the ER that night and all of us were very, VERY lucky. The worst of us have PTSD and even with that I'm thankful every day that I'm still alive.\n\nEdit: please note that the news media failed to cover this story accurately for almost 5 days. None of us were airlifted, none of us died, and twenty three scouts and three adults were hospitalized. They were far too much in a rush for a good story about a boy scout camp that they were ready to watch people sue the pants off of. It never happened. The camp did us all justice and helped us out tremendously. ",

    "body": "Similar experience.  This was maybe 10 years ago when I was living in Aurora, IL.  I stopped for gas and was about to leave when a car came into the station at high speed.  The car came to a stop and two teenage girls jumped out screaming and hysterical.  I went over to help, at which point they told me a bird had flown into their car while they were driving.  They didn't know what to do and, frankly, neither did I but I have a tendency to jump into situations when people and/or animals are in need.  \n\nI peeked into the car and found that the bird, which was quite large, was either dead or knocked out cold.  He/she apparently flew directly into the rear windshield from the inside and was bleeding from its beak.  Upon closer examination the bird was definitely still alive but not conscious.  I took off my tshirt and wrapped the bird in it, at which point the girls jumped back in the car and took off.  Now I am standing there at a gas station, shirtless, and holding what I would later find out was an unconscious Peregrine Falcon.  \n\nThere happened to be a cop inside the gas station and, when he came out, I asked him what I should do.  He had no idea, aside from calling animal control.  I knew first hand that animal control in that area had a \"kill first, help second\" policy so that wasn't the way to go.  \n\nThe cop left to pursue more important law enforcement matters, at which point I decided to bring the falcon home with me until I figured out what to do.  Once I got home I started Googling and found a bird sanctuary about an hour away, so I hopped in the car with my new friend and off we went.  At this point the falcon is still wrapped in my tshirt but I put him in a box with the lid open so I could keep an eye on him.  Keep in mind, this is a big bird of prey we are talking about here so it is bit intimidating to drive around with one next to you, unconscious or not. \n\nAnyway, I get about halfway to the sanctuary when the falcon starts waking up.  I can see him moving around in my peripheral vision and I can hear him/her making noise.  I casually closed the box up while still driving to ensure he/she didn't jump out and try to eat me.  Thankfully, I made it to the sanctuary without incident.  \n\nAfter I pulled up I grabbed the box and ran it inside, which felt like a scene from an emergency room tv show.  I was expecting to be greeted by someone with a similar sense of urgency about the situation, but the person I talked to acted like it was no big deal.  Nothing to see here - just a giant falcon.  As it turns out, this happens all of the time and they get people like me dropping off injured birds every day.  They even had a form you could fill out to identify yourself and report what happened.  \n\nFast forward a couple months and I receive a letter in the mail from the bird sanctuary letting me know my falcon friend had been rehabilitated and released back into the wild.  That was a really good feeling, and it is something I think about often.  Given that Peregrine Falcons can live over 20 years from what I have read, I like to think he/she is still out there somewhere living the good life. \n\nEdit - thanks for the gold!  Sorry, but no pics.  This was a very long time ago.  I might be able to dig up the letter from the bird sanctuary but even that is a long shot.  Sorry!\n\nEdit 2 - a word - \"peeked\" instead of \"peaked\" because that communicated all the wrong things",

    "body": "I had a pet duck when I was a kid. I was 2 years old, and there was a  pet shop that had one on display. My mother wanted me to have a dog, but we lived in an apartment, and she never liked cats. She took me to the pet shop to get a fish, and I went crazy about the duck, so she bought it (I don't remember any of that, she told me). We named him Facundo, until she laid an egg, so Facunda. Apparently the cold from the apartment floor wasn't good for her, and she got arthritis in her right leg. We used to put her leg in warm water several times a day, until she got better, but she always had a slight limp in that leg. A few years later we moved back to the countryside, so we also got two dogs, and afterwards two rabbits. I ate more duck eggs than chicken eggs in my childhood, delicious. When she was around 5 or 6 years old, she started nesting all the fucking time, and taking care of her eggs. We couldn't find a male duck for her, but a guy from a nearby farm that raised ducks gave us a dozen eggs, said they were a mix, but at least one or two should hatch. So we changed her unfertilized eggs for this ones (bitch wouldn't let us even get close to them) ... and FUCKING NINE HATCHED, and 8 lived. She walked around the yard all day, proud as fuck, with her babies following her. She was more dog than duck though, she came when you called her, she played, she didn't mind being held, and she was badass: our German Shepherd Toby was genuinely scared of her. We also had a family of phymy chickens. The day she died (purely of old age), goddamn, was the saddest thing I had ever seen: She had been feeling bad for a few days already, so we kept her inside most of the day (it was winter). That afternoon we could tell she didn't have much strength left in her, and we wanted her to be with her babies (who were all adults already), so we let them all into the kitchen, where she was. After she passed, I was crying,my sister was crying, my mother was crying, and her babies went around her poking her to see if she would move, then they did what we called \"duck cake\", were they all pile up together to stay warm. It was legit the sweetest thing I've seen on 32 years on this planet. So, I was raised with 2 dogs, 9 ducks, pygmy 3 chickens, three regular chickens, and two rabbits, I couldn't be happier. I don't have any picks with me right now though, they're all at my mother's house and not digitized. I should get around to that one of this days. ",

    "body": "Thanks!  I don't know why but this is something I end up doing fairly often.  Just a couple months ago when I was coming back to work from lunch I noticed a pigeon hopping around on one foot with a wing that didn't look right.  It took me about 30 minutes but I finally was able to pick him up from under a car where he was hiding.  Turned out he had a broken leg and a broken wing - rough shape, and would have died.  Again, wrapped him up in my shirt and put him in a box.  Then I went online and found an organization called the Chicago Bird Collision Monitors.  They arranged for one of their volunteers to come pick the bird up from me at my office and get it to a vet who moonlights in bird rehabilitation.  I never found out what happened but I am hoping the pigeon made it.  \n\nThe one that sticks with me the most is when I saw a big turtle on the side of the road.  This was maybe 12 years ago.  When I say big -  I mean easily 2 feet long, 1.5 feet wide or so.  Someone had run him over and his shell was cracked very badly and he was bleeding.  From what I understand this is extremely painful for turtles, and that was apparent in his behavior.  In this instance I called animal control but was advised not to move the turtle for fear of making the situation worse.  Instead I just kept my car parked behind him to prevent any other cars from running him over and I just sat there to keep him company.  It took about an hour before anyone came out but once they arrived I was assured he would be taken care of.  I guess they can repair the damaged shell but I never found out for sure what happened.  I can still see his face in my mind.",
