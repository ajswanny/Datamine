For the first time in my life in twenty years I work at a company that is totally cool with me slacking and playing video games while getting paid for it.  I've worked labor intensive jobs my whole life and a few of those also paid me for my technical knowledge.  But, fuck me, I'm at the slackest job I've ever worked and after a few days of doing nothing I dared ventured playing a video game and I was very worried about being yelled at or fired or something.  Nope.  Nothing.\n\nKeep up the good work!\n\nBecause, when shit needs to get done I get it done and then I ask if they need anything else.  With no replies ... hm... I got time to kill.\n\nThe Contra Code has become my paycheck and I just can't believe this is real!",

He's involved in managing distribution, which means truck drivers are under him and that means there tends to be random spurts of downtime for some workers.  On the lowest security, which is the general purpose wifi, people started adding their personal phones to it for that occasional spurt of downtime when they had to wait for something.  Their IT guy started, on his own, getting real pissy about it and started telling people he was going to \"crack down on unauthorized network access\".\n\nMy friend changed his device name to \"Glade Air Freshener\", and other names that people used were \"ISIS Broadcasting Cave\", Garbage Disposal, A Phone, Not Authorized Device, Daves Hat, Several Rolls of Duct Tape, and Garage Light System.  The IT guy being someone who has nothing better to do, was infuriated, and started asking around who was who.  \n\nAfter a little while, presumably he googled how to MAC ban people, and that was the end of that...well until my friend told me about it.  Being a good friend, I informed him that you can spoof your MAC address to get around the hardware bans.  The result?  New device names such as \"YOU CANT STOP THE FRESHNESS\".  \n\nEven further infuriated, the IT guy started kicking random devices that looked even remotely suspicious.  Then, it starts getting funny because he finally accidentally kicks off the CEO's secondary device from the general access network.  So he finally stops and tells him \"Look, I don't care at all if people are on the wifi.  So long as they're doing their job, it's FINE.\"  \n\nThe weirdest thing about that workplace?  It sounds like a dreamjob for most IT people (minus the pay) but the last IT guy only lasted a few months apparently.  ",
