One of the parent coaches disagreed with how I ran the game and was appalled that his daughter had tripped but no call was made (can't make a call if your kid is just clumsy man). He then continued to scream at me for the entire game saying how he had been in varsity soccer in high school and that \"this shit did not fly\" in the rule book. Mind you this man is in his 50's and the girls are 4th grade and not even in travel soccer, just in a small town league. Ended up ending the game early because I did not feel safe in the environment. Seeing that coaches face when I called off the game because he was threatening me was the best feeling ever, and my advisor also screamed at him for making a ninth grade girl have to deal with that. \n\nEDIT: holy shit this comment is popular, I got gilded, so thanks! A few people were confused on why I just didn't just eject the dad and continue the game. Yes, I was also able to do that but this team had had issues before with said coach and the only way to actually get him to realize the damage he was doing was to stop the entire game instead of just having him punished. It was just an association game, not club/travel, so we have modified and more lax rules. ",

I'd love to see all my patients at exactly the time they made thier appointment but sometimes the patients before you take longer and it's out of our control. I have 20 minutes per patient. That's not my choice, that's what the health system I work for set it as. Twenty minutes is usually enough. For example, someone comes in with a sore throat. I can do a rapid strep, physical assessment, and chart in 20 minutes. The problem lies with that patient saying to me as I'm handing them thier after visit sumary \"oh by the way I can't feel my feet and I've been shitting blood and I have migraines constantly.\" \n\nWell, that complicates things, and it brings up a host of new issues I need to address. It's gonna take me longer than 20 minutes, which means the next appointment gets pushed back. I'd say in any given day, a third of my appointments will end up like that. If it's not a pressing issue, I can ask them to make another appointment. If it's something serious, in good conscience I can't boot them out. One patient this week took me an hour and a half to fully work up because they had a laundry list of problems.  They had a 20 minute appointment scheduled. I was able to see patients while waiting on diagnostics, but they took longer because I was juggling the problem child of the day. Sometimes xray is lagging behind and I dont want someone to leave before I can make sure they don't have a fracture or pneumonia. Sometimes I have to call pharmacies because someone has no idea what Meds they have or what they are allergic to.  If everything goes to plan, then the time we have is fine. When it doesn't, and it rarely does, people have to wait. I'd change it if I could, and I bust my ass to make it happen, but it doesn't always work out. \n\n",

    "body": "A friend of the family tried to heavily reform our local park district way back in the day. His plan was rejected so he went off on his own and founded his own league. It started as baseball but later expanded to basketball, football, soccer, etc. It's been a huge hit and it's because he's structured the entire thing around learning and healthier competition/respect for the game/competitors. The kids are obsessed with it and the high school coaches are all big on his athletes when they make it to them. One of his big rules is any negativity from the parents, and ANYTHING aimed at the kid umps/refs is an automatic and immediate expulsion from the facility. He has a really good infrastructure in place for complaints so people can still feel like they're heard, they're just not allowed to behave like assholes at the games. It's awesome. \n\nFun coda to the whole thing, the park district leadership at the time had a weird, personal vendetta against him (hence shutting down his plan in the first place) and they tried to counter schedule to squeeze him out. They ended up nearly killing their own programs. It was a great example of a good idea working out. The only downside was it wasn't (relatively) inexpensive like the city program. Most people were fine, and if anyone had an issue, there were scholarships available, although I think this was on the DL. Solid dude. Great neighbor, great dad, great friend. (Great boss, too. I coached for him at one point, he coached my brother for years and years until *he* then worked for him, too.)\n\nEdit: I've reached out and I'm going to see if he thinks his website can survive a Hug of Death from Reddit and/or possibly do an AMA. Will update when I get a response.\n\n**EDIT 2**\nOkay, here it is. The man's name is Kraig Moreland and his company is [New Vision Athletics](http://newvisionathletics.com/) and he's open to being contacted (which can be done through the site).\n\nIf you don't want to go through the website, [here's a YouTube video of him talking about it.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjVQncsKW4Y)\n\nHe and I exchanged emails last night, and beyond general catching up, he did have the following words of wisdom:\n\n>My plans are to start franchising NVA in another 4 to 5 years.  Truth is the Oprah Show called me about 15 years ago to do a piece on me for their \"angel\" segment -- and I turned it down. Probably the only guy to say no to Oprah's people. But I was smart and it was the right thing to do because I knew oprah's influence.  If I had done that show I would've had 10,000 phone messages the next day from moms & dads all over America who's children had been wronged by some local coach --and who would want me to come start an NVA league in their town.  And I would've had about another 5,000 guys in their mid 30's tired of their accounting or sales jobs all contacting me wanting to ask 1000 questions on how to start an NVA to get out of their current careers they hate. \n\n>Truth is, NVAs just can't be opened like a Dunkin' Donuts or McDonalds.  There are lots and lots of things that go into starting an NVA ... and it would require the right person and the right community and the right set of circumstances to make one happen. \n\n>If I had followed the money .... I might be 10 to 15 million dollars richer right now ... but I never would've seen my children grow up. I still get to drive my kids to school each day and tell them I love them ... and I still have nearly 4 months off a year vacation time + make more money than I ever imagined. And just so people don't think NVA is a league where kids all get trophies for \"trying\" we believe it's ok for kids to fail. Not everyone gets an award. We have winners and losers at the higher levels of our programs. And professional athletes have entrusted me to teach their children the right way to learn and develop to play a sport like PGA golfer Chip Beck, chicago bulls players Bill Wennington, John Paxson and bulls / golden state warriors coach Steve Kerr, chicago bears players Chris Chandler, Bigcat Wiiliams, Erik Kramer, Olin Kreutz, Brian Hoyer and Charles Tillman just to name a few.\n\n>The best compliment I got this year came from two umpires in a high-level travel baseball tournament we took second place in this year who said, \"Man... we (all the umpires at the tournament ) were talking the other day that you are the calmest coach we've ever seen at these events.\"  I thanked them and explained that it's because my ego is not attached to how the kids preform. They are children trying to learn and play a very complex game with a lot of weird rules and my role is to help them understand it, develop them as players, try to build a love of the game for each of them --  they will have plenty of time to be verbally beaten down by coaches in high school and college if they keep playing ... so that isn't my role. \n\n>Most people - parents and coaches - that yell at umpires or officials or players simply have control issues .... once you understand that it makes it a lot easier to deal with these folks.",

Go sit in your car until you can act like a rational person. After the first year, I started ejecting parents from other teams, not just mine. The little kids play sideways on the field, with four teams on one field I can still hear when parents are being inappropriate. It was two years before anyone got around to telling me I didn't have the authority to eject parents from the bleachers. And I still do it. THEY don't know I don't have authority.\n\nPossibly I'm letting imagined power go to my head, but it's damn satisfying to tell a middle aged man to shut up and take a time out for screaming at a kindergartener. And I've had a lot more thank-yous than punches to the face. \n\nEdit: I think I may have given the impression that rabid parents are the norm - they're not!

ChumpCar (and to a lesser extent LeMons) is a relatively cheap way to get into some very intense, competitive racing.\n\nWorking with your hands is therapeutic, but that's not actually what makes racing such a good fit for military guys. Prepping a racecar takes many hours of busting knuckles with your buddies. If he spends a few hundred hours crawling around under a car with a group of strangers, I guarantee they'll be close friends by the time it ever turns a wheel in anger. Race weekends (particularly longer, 12hr+ events) do a very good job emulating the \"hurry up and wait\" feel of military life. You spend the majority of the time sitting around while the car is on track, but you have to be mentally prepared to immediately jump into action to fix unexpected problems as fast as possible. Successful teams also tend to have lots of standard procedures and a fairly rigid team hierarchy, with a single team captain or pit chief calling the shots on race day. Trust is critical to success during pit stops or mechanical repairs; the captain needs to trust that everyone will do what he/she tells them to do without second guessing, and the team needs to trust that the captain has a plan and knows what they're doing.\n\nIt's not necessarily obvious unless you have experience with racing, but it is a *very* good fit for military types. I've raced with several former military guys, and they really thrive in environments where complex needs to get done in a very specific way at a very specific time.\n\nIf he's actually interested in driving, there are a ton of teams who rent out seats. It's a good, safe way to get an adrenaline fix. I would encourage him to get involved in the wrenching side of things though, regardless of whether he wants to drive. I bet he'd really benefit from being part of a cohesive team.\n\nIf you and your friends want to start your own team, there's a ton of information out there for newbs. There are also tons of teams around the country (including a couple all-vet teams), so he could probably find one which needs another set of hands. The East coast, California, and Midwest regions in particular are just gagging with teams, and the Northwest has a small but dedicated base of teams.  Even if he's not technically inclined, he can learn. His experience getting shit done in fast paced, very high pressure environments will more than make up for any lack of mechanical aptitude. ",

    "body": "Sorry it took so long, so I'll give you my piece on it. When I get back stateside I need about 1 month away from the military completely. I take leave and go do something. My favorite thing to do is go camping solo for at least 2 weeks. I then try and spend time with my family doing activities like parks, museums, picnics, etc. \n\nOne thing I like to do to get my camaraderie (brotime) is playing sports. I am the uncle Rico of softball. I found a league downtown and got close with some of the guys. I also go to the gun range for serenity time. They have shooter comps there and I can get in with some great guys with similar interests. \n\nWhat I hate more than anything is the constant eyes watching me, the \"what do you want to do todays\", \"how are you coping\", \"do you need anything\", \"are you having fun\" type stuff from family and friends. I tell my family I'm going to do weird stuff and to just let me do it. I go into restaurants and do mental layouts, go to the bathroom to check for escape routes and fortified positions. I park my vehicle away from others and walk to stores, I sweep my car for explosives before getting into it with my kids, etc. My family understands I'll do it and has come to realize it is what I do. \n\nMy advice to you is be there for him when he needs it, if he has a flashback, let it happen. Wait til he calms down and just be there. Let him work through it, it takes time. The VA has great hot lines for vets to talk to, and most of all make sure he knows you all care for him. Just knowing you have friends and family that love you does wonders. ",

At first it was gross, and I didn't understand why anyone would want to listen to that.  Then some months later I heard something that caught my interest and all of a sudden \"okay maybe this isn't so bad\".  Some I liked more than others of course, but the fact was once I'd accept that \"screaming is a valid form of expression\" the push to dislike it on principle evaporated.\n\nEver since then I've had that new outlook that people are enjoying music I \"don't get\" for reasons I just haven't considered yet.  People aren't listening to country music for the same reasons I'm listening to EDM/metal/whatever it happens to be.  They're listening for *other* reasons, and whether or not I personally feel the same that's completely valid.\n\nPop songs are a great example, because they're usually far from the interesting, complex, technical things I traditionally was drawn to.  They're repetitive, boring, right?  Until I started being interested in composition, and saw how expertly written a lot of it is.  And now, sounding out pop songs and figuring out what makes them tick has become a new thing I'm currently doing to further my skills.  Two years ago I'd have told you there's no way I'd ever be interested in listening to Taylor Swift at all.  Now I might be super interested in figuring out the way her songs work so I can borrow elements/further my own abilities.\n\nIt's all about just accepting that *you* are not the only person in the world and that other people live different lives with different preferences.  I'd like to think it's a realization everyone comes to at some point in their life, but.. for many people it seems like that might not be the case.",

Why wasn't I more happy that more people were finally appreciating something I'd been loving for so long? \n\nI guess some people just have a strong urge to be special and unique and have something that's theirs. People like exclusivity and when that territory gets invaded, the exclusivity disappears. There was a little forum called \"Holmesian.Net\" where I a relatively small group of fans congregated to discuss the canon and various pastiches with. I made genuine personal connections and had a community. After Holmes blew up the board got overrun, hacked and ultimately went offline. It was super tragic for me.

To be fair, I was a terrible demon of a child, but still.  For most of my life I always just felt embarressed for him when he would blow up on me like that in front of people.  I would try to tell him it's embarressing.  All in all though, he is a good father.  I'm an adult now, and we are close. He has worked on his temper for years and is much better now.  He has also apologized to me for being so angry at me as a child.  Not sure why I shared this.  I hate crazy parents who take sports too seriously and freak out on their children, but my dad turned out okay and I'm not ruined as an adult.   \n\nEdit:  Shit, I'm a female people.  Also, chill.  Thank you for the nice comments people who have been nice.  People who are analyzing my family life, calm down.  You don't know everything about my family life growing up.  I wanted to share my experience to say it's easy to make assumptions without knowing the full story.  I WAS an awful kid, it wasn't my parents' fault.  My dad didn't necessarily handle me well, but he's not a monster and sometimes it's hard to know what the right thing is when you're a new parent with a tough child.  People who yell at their kids over losing in a sport suck, but people who yell in general aren't necessarily terrible people and you don't have the whole story after witnessing one scene.",

It was a play-off game and the host lost so their fans threw a ragefest on us.\n\nTwo days ago I went to a nearby park to watch u12s play in tournament. There were at least 10 teams and the crowd was 5 times the size. Every kid had a support from parents, siblings, their school mates and even random people who happened to be in the  park that day and joined the crowd to watch the matches. But the height of any misdemeanor by anyone in the crowd would be to let a sigh of disbelief at their kid blundering or missing an open goal which was nothing in contrast to constant cheering and words of support every kid would get from their coach and their parents, friends. Every 10 seconds I could hear someone in the crowd call out a player's name on the field and encourage them with something like: \"bravo, Marko, keep it up\", \"good job, Nikola, nice shot\" etc.\nI guess it's a cultural thing but whenever a kid makes a mistake here they automatically get lifted up by words of encouragement first from their coach and then everybody else including teammates. That's good pedagogy and also stimulates the kid to not run himself down and builds up his confidence. \n\n\n\n",

My friend is this super meek fragile sort of human who flusters easily so when the dad of our goalie cornered her one day and demanded that she fix his kids numbers to look better or else (imagine a large yelling guido if you will) she ended up completely shutting down. Everytime his son would get scored on, he'd glare at her to see if she'd record it causing her to shake and eventually want to quit which, considering how much she loved it, was huge.
