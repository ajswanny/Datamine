    "body": "When I was about 8 years old our school had a postbox for Christmas cards and about once a week teachers would come round and give the children their respective cards. One of my classmates, Ryan, who for some reason always disliked me and picked on me occasionally got a card and opened it to see the words \"YOU WILL DIE\". He laughed it off, but the next day my teacher attempted to launch a full scale forensic investigation and incorrectly concluded that the handwriting was mine, and I had the motive.\n\nI denied it repeatedly because I had absolutely nothing to do with it but my teacher just wouldn't let it go. He called class meetings to see if anybody knew who sent the card - no success. He pulled what few friends I had into a private room to see if he could get them to rat me out - no success. He kept trying to \"surprise\" a confession out of me by occasionally mentioning the card recipient's name in general conversation and gauging the reaction on my confused infant face - no success.\n\nEventually about a week later my teacher dropped the bomb. My class would not be allowed to go to the school Christmas party/disco/thing unless the culprit is found. Being that I didn't have many friends and I was fairly socially awkward I decided it wouldn't be a big deal if I missed that party, and that I should take one for the team. **Here's the \"why the fuck did I say that?\" moment:** I told my teacher that it was me who sent the card so that my class could have fun, and to this day I regret it.\n\nI was sent to the headteacher's office (which, when you're 8 years old and terrified of unknown consequences, you arrive at in tears) where I was shouted at for about half an hour. I was told how despicable I was, what a disgusting thing it was to do, and he even said that it almost became a police matter because it was a death threat. I vividly remember the headteacher looking really disappointed at one point and him saying to himself \"and this is supposed to be the season of good will to all men\", and I just felt awful. I was made to apologise to the classmate in question, as well as write a three page letter of apology. Then the worst part: my school called my parents and they were horrified at what I'd supposedly done.\n\nIt was an incredibly negative formative experience from my childhood and I think about it regularly. Because of my stupidity and my teacher's actions I was ostracised by my peers for a long time which made my early years quite difficult. Even nineteen years later, every so often I think about going back to my school and speaking to my old teacher and headteacher to clarify the situation. Explain that it wasn't me. Set the record straight. Last time I looked at the school website though, both have left so I guess it's something I'll have to live with.\n\nEdit: I've had some really heartwarming responses to this as replies and inbox messages.

It turned out that a cute girl from my school lived in the same building. So we would hang out and play video games together or cook stuff together. When I look back on it, she was most definitely trying to get some, but she was 16. Even though the age of consent was 16 in my state, and shit would have probably been totally fine, had it gone down, nothing ever happened. OK, I'll admit that I was pretty socially awkward and didn't pick up on hints, or was too afraid to make any moves. Anyway, a lot of PG hanging out between this girl and I. Well one day, we're in my apartment and we hear some angry slamming on my door. It's her mom and she's pissed because she obviously thinks we're boning 24/7. She storms in and tells her daughter to grab all her stuff and leave. As the mom is walking out after her daughter, I'll never fucking forget this in my life... she asks me, \"do you even know how old she is?\" with this half condescending, half disgusted tone of voice. My genius response was, \"the age of consent is 16.\" So matter-of-factly that there would never be a thing anyone could say to convince her I wasn't plowing her daughter all along. She looked bewildered for a split second before she says, \"oh...\" and left my apartment.\n\nThat shit haunted me to the bone for so long until I became more comfortable with sexuality and socializing in general. Then I realized that my deadpan delivery was actually hilariously ballsy and I would have never had the courage to say what I did if I only knew what the fuck I was saying.",

My girlfriend turned around and saw me and told me to hurry up, so now I was standing there my phone out and open, my gf has spotted me trying to be sneaky, it's now or never so I ask him to take some pictures. \n\nIt went alright, he didn't run off with my phone. But the 4 pictures he took were completely blurry. This one turned out the most clear of the bunch.

I leaned across the car and hugged her. My head happened to be in her bosom, so trying to be a gentleman I closed my eyes. Also zipper in the eye would suck. As I retreated from the hug, I felt some pressure on the back of my head and then on my face. My eyes were still closed and I was too confused to remember how to open them.\n\nAfter a split second, I wasn't as freaked out and kinda enjoyed the warmth from whatever was on my face (it was December in Canada). Then I started to feel something super warm and super wet slide in between my lips. I didn't know what was happening but it felt so very very wrong.\n\nI jumped back and opened my eyes and realized she was kissing me... Obviously... Both freaked out and embarrassed I just jumped away, I say \"ughhh okay bye\" and jumped out of the car. Mentally freaking out because not only did I just jump away from a kiss, I ran away from the girl. So preoccupied with my thoughts, I forgot that the entire sidewalk was ice. Slipped and took a swan dive into the ground. I immediately scrambled back to my feet and made a run for it. This ultimately ended up with my on my back two steps later.\n\nI got home with bruises all over my body and my ego...",

This well-tatted coworker Lauren says she wouldn't want that because when you gain weight or get pregnant the tattoo will stretch, and even when you lose the weight/have the baby, the tattoo will be wrecked. All fair.\n\n\nWell Alyssa says \"That's not a problem for me, I can't get pregnant.\"\n\n\n\nI had somehow *just* found out that rape can ruin a woman's reproductive system so before my brain could catch up to decorum, I blurted out \"Why? Did you get raped or something?\"\n\n\nLauren laughs incredulously. \"Jesus, thebumm. What the fuck?\" Others heard too and also laughed. I was like, \"Yeah. Whoops.\"\n\n\nAlyssa apparently heard not! She's like \"What'd you say?\" And I thought I was clear so I said \"Nah, it was rude. Just a joke.\" and she demanded I tell her, so I did. And she's just like \"Yeah, I was. It's in my testimony.\" And the laughter stopped and I allowed the darkness to swallow me.

I am a sinner and unfit to spend eternity with our Heavenly Father and his Son. But I aspire to live my life like our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. I have accepted Him into my heart and I have been baptized in the name of the Father, The Son, and the Holy Spirit. It's only because of His ultimate sacrifice on the cross that I believe I will go to heaven when my soul leaves this earth. One day I will live in paradise and celebrate the infinite wisdom of God with all of my loved ones. Until then, I intend to spread the Gospel and do His good works here on Earth so that when I stand before Peter at the Holy Gates, I can say with a clear conscious that I have tried to live a Godly life.  \n\nIt's clear to me, Sir, as I'm sure it is to you, that we are all undeserving sinners blessed by His mercy. \"For God so loved the world, He gave His only begotten son, so that whoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have eternal life\" - John 3:16. I read my Bible, Sir. \n\nThen you give a good firm handshake and maintain eye contact. Boom. You're in. \n\n\n\nAlternatively, you could go old school and say something like  \"I have twenty sheep, a few slaves, and several acres of barley fields I could trade you for your daughter if you pinky swear she's a virgin\".
