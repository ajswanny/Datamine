    "body": "The summer after I graduated from high school, I left work early and went up to my parent's cabin in northern Michigan. Spent that night at the beach watching the sunset. Once the sun went down and it became nearly pitch black (no light pollution) I got to my car and started driving down the highway (M22). After about 10 seconds of being at speed, there was an older Tahoe (late 90's) that started riding my ass and flashing it's high beams. So, I got up to about 60 in a 45. They were still on my ass. \n\n\nI pulled off to the side road that my parent's cabin is off of and they took the same turn. I thought this seemed weird cause there's only about 30-40 houses on the road. So I went all the way to the end, which is usually a dead end but leads to a maintenance area for the golf course nearby. Truck was still following me. At this point I was freaking out because if I pulled into the house they'd know where we lived and they were still following close by.\n\n\nI took a ton of random turns and the truck kept following every single turn for about 15 minutes. I finally had a chance to make a turn with traffic going through the intersection that gave me a few seconds of a head start. Pulled down a side street, went up 100 yards, turned off all of my lights and waited. Truck slowly drove by the perpendicular street and kept going. Booked it home, pulled my car around the side away from the main road, and pulled every curtain. For an 18 year old, I was scared as hell that night.",

    "body": "This is [a repost](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/v9uae/whenever_i_see_a_scary_thread_it_ends_up_being/c52r3uf/) from a few years ago, but it's my story and it applies to your question.\n\n\nI once worked as a live-in staff member in a college dormitory. \n\n\nDuring the summer we housed the few summer school students who remained on campus (nearly 30). It may be significant to point out these students tended towards the highly academically-motivated, often times high-stress students, if quiet.\n\n\nOne warm day in late June my office received a call from a concerned sibling that she and her family was unable to reach her brother who lived by himself in a room on the summer school floor. This wasn't unusual as our office frequently dealt with students avoiding their kith and kin due to frayed nerves or general social awkwardness.\n\n\nOur normal protocol to check on a student is to try to reach them by our emergency contact information, failing that - go check their room to verify they're living in the building and perhaps available then and there, then have them call their family to verify we followed up on the original request. Also - we are to only enter a room with another staff member present to ensure personal safety of staff and students.\nI failed to reach this student on his room and mobile phone, and was working short-staffed so since I was on my own I decided to pop up to his room and check on him.\nI arrived on his floor around 2 in the afternoon and the floor seemed deserted as I had expected. I found his room number and immediately noticed the sound of a movie playing on a TV or computer from behind the door. I knocked three times and announced that I was a staff member checking on his health and safety.\n\n\nNo answer.\n\n\nI didn't think this was that remarkable, college students are notorious for leaving electronics running while not in the room. I checked the floor showers and bathrooms and found them deserted.\n\n\nI returned to his door and knocked three more times, waiting about 20 seconds between each knock.\n\n\nNo answer.\n\n\nThis is when my instincts started to buzz. I worked in residence halls a number of years as a professional and something about all the pieces of this puzzle weren't adding up; family concerned about his health and safety, electronics running (someone must have started them recently, within the time frame of a movie run-time), summer school students and their idiosyncratic behavior, something wasn't right.\n\n\nI was by myself, so I probably let myself get more worked up than if I was with someone else. A deserted dorm floor, even at 2 in the afternoon, oftentimes evokes Kubrician memories of the Overlook Hotel . . .\n\n\nI decided that for some sense of closure or sanity I needed the immediate resolution of keying into this student's room, even though I was by myself and not technically supposed to do so.\n\n\nI knocked on the door one more time for good measure, again announced myself as the hall director. I keyed into the room and my spider sense went off even stronger:\nThe room appeared relatively vacant; the student appeared to be living out of a suitcase (which is unusual for someone staying no less than 8 weeks for a summer school session). The bedding was tussled like someone had been sleeping in it and all the lights in the room were on. And as I had suspected, there was an open laptop on a desk running on battery power playing The Matrix. But no student.\nI began to start rationalizing to keep from feeling unsettled; surely this student and I had crossed paths on my way to his room (I'd never met him before so I wouldn't recognize him otherwise) and perhaps he was just down in the lobby picking up delivery food for a late lunch.\n\n\nSure, that's it.\n\n\nThen I turned to leave, planning on trying to reach the student later in the afternoon or that night. As I turned to leave I noticed another odd piece of evidence; the accordion closet doors (which are removed in most rooms due to disuse, particularly single rooms like his) were still in this room. And they were closed.\n\n\nOdd. I couldn't remember the last time I actually saw someone use those cranky, dysfunctional doors. Then my intuition spiked higher than ever. SHIT SHIT SHIT. I realized I was alone in a room with a potentially suicidal student who may, in fact, have completed just that. And I am about to be \"that guy\" who discovers the body and then has a shit storm of paperwork and undesirable tasks, not the least of which would be calling the family back to break the news.\n\n\nI felt like I was talking to myself when my voice cracked as I spoke to the closed doors and announced my name and title and that I would be opening those accordion doors in 3 seconds.\n\n\nI fumbled with the latch on the doors, and finally managed to get them disengaged, and as I slid the doors apart, I was unprepared. I don't know what I really expected, a hanging? gunshot wound?\n\n\nI'll tell you what I didn't expect: a 7' dark-skinned Indian man staring at me embarrassingly as though I had found his secret hangout. We stared at each other for a good 15 seconds without blinking, breathing or speaking.\nI finally realized what was going on and my natural emotion was disbelief. All I could think to say was, \"Um . . . are you in here hiding from me?\"\n\n\nHe looked at me and said, \"Yah.\"\n\n\nMy heart was still racing, I turned to leave and before I shut his door I turned back to him and said, \"Call your sister, she's worried about you, and, frankly, I am too.\"\n\n\nTLDR, I met an Indian in the cupboard. Literally. Scared me.",

She added me on social media and then got upset when i didn't reply to her constant messages (i told her that i don't really use social media). \n\nAnyway, i didn't see her for a few months and figured she'd just gone back to her own school or stopped studying or whatever, and was relieved that she'd clearly got bored of me. But then last week she comes in and gives me an envelope full of photos of me during lessons that she'd taken... without me knowing. I was a little weirded out to say the least. \n\nEdit: I wouldn't worry about me too much guys. The girl's creepy, but she's just a young (20s) girl interested in the  foreign teacher.

    "body": "New Year's Day, 1995. I was in the middle of 3rd year university, and a bunch of friends had come down to visit me and my roommate for the festivities. We were all pretty hungover from drinking the night before, and went out for the usual \"nice day out, a bit chilly, I don't feel so good\" post-greasy-breakfast hungover stroll around the neighbourhood.\n\nTwo of these friends were twin brothers. One of them, we hung out with all the time. The other we'd just met for the first time. He was pretty normal the night before, joining in the fun, but on this day, we were all hanging around a local basketball court shooting hoops with an old basketball we'd found in the grass, and this twin brother kept following me around all over the place with the creepiest grin I'd ever seen in my life. Staring right into the nether regions of my soul, the whole time.\n\nI'd back away and join the group again, and he'd keep following me around. When we were walking back to the apartment, it was just me and him walking down the sidewalk behind the group, and he moved over in front of me, stared at me with that creepy look again, and fell down to his knees as if to worship me or something. I didn't know what to do... \"Hey buddy? You all right? We're heading back now, right?\" And so on. He wouldn't say anything - he'd just be there on his knees, looking up at me with a clenched face and squinted eyes, as if he were looking directly into the sun or something.\n\nLater that day, my roomie said he was tripping balls, so I thought nothing of it and moved on with my life. A few weeks later, we got a phone call from the twin brother we usually hung out with, and it turned out that this other twin brother went over to his aunt's place with a knife and stabbed her 14 times. She didn't die, but you know, still pretty bad. He had even called the police before going, because he knew he was going to do it but he couldn't stop himself from doing it, because you know, \"the voices\" and so on.\n\nThe ensuing court case was widely covered in the media as this was a relatively smaller community where this sort of thing doesn't happen on a regular basis. I was reading one of the articles and one of the testimonies was that this twin brother was severely schizophrenic and was hearing voices in his head. He believed to his very bones that his aunt was the devil, and that he had been commanded by God to go and kill her.\n\nSo, who was this \"God\" that told him to go kill her? Well, as the newspaper article described, it was a guy in a group he hung out with on New Year's Day. Didn't take me long to realize that he was talking about me. \n\nThis was 22 years ago. I know for a fact it was a mental illness, but just knowing that I had somehow \"commanded\" him to go kill his aunt stays with me to this day.\n\nEDIT: Holy smokes, didn't expect this to blow up the way it did. To address some oft-repeated questions: \n\n1) No, the cops never questioned me, and I'm actually now wondering why not. It makes sense that they would, right? \n\n2) Some people wondered if this was just a made-up story and wanted proof, i.e. a link to the article I'm talking about. Well, I sent an email to the newspaper to see if they have anything in their digital archives, but more important to mention right now: this was 1995. The internet was hardly anything at the time. We students were still researching via books at the library and physically writing and handing in our essays and term papers. That being said, I'm searching and will put something here if I can find anything.\n\nEDIT 2: Clips, courtesy of /u/coocooforcoconut: https://imgur.com/a/PiOJG Turns out he was not criminally responsible for what he did. This one doesn't say anything about being commanded by \"God\", but this was obviously one of a few articles.\n\nEDIT 3: I had a different link in there that contained horrific stories about foreskin and stuff. It was literally the only thing I could find online at the time - but I've removed it. Don't want to be traumatizing people more than I already did. Thanks all.\n\nEDIT 4: Gold?! God damn. Thanks, anonymous redditor!",

I go to houses and apartments and condos to do my thing.\n\nI was working in one particular condo building with over 70 floors and about 8 elevators. The elevators are in two groups of four, with two giant elevator shafts. Just picture one giant square that is the lobby and two smaller rectangles in that room that are the elevator shafts. The two shafts are identical looking.\n\nThis is relevant because it's easy to get disoriented as to which direction you are facing when you exit an elevator.\n\nAnyways, after doing a bit of work on the 65th floor unit, I realize I have to go to Parking level 1 to a utility room. No big deal. I hop on the elevator and press P1, and take a lonely ride down 60+ floors.\n\nI reach P1 level, and when the elevator doors open I hear weeping. I'm immediately worried for whoever is crying, so I start to pinpoint where the noise is coming from.\n\nIt's a child crying, and since all the walls in this area are bare and concrete, the sound is echoing and seems to be coming from everywhere.\n\nPanic didn't set in until I had searched 4 corners of the square room and hadn't found anyone. Now I'm no mathematician, but I'm pretty sure four corners is all of them...so my mind starts racing.\n\nI decide to nope out and head back to the door that would eventually lead me to the utility room that I was supposed to be working in, which I had already passed earlier on my search.\n\nI round the corner and there I found the source of the noise. It's a little girl, with straight black hair, crouched down, sobbing into her knees facing the corner. I don't know why I didn't see her before, because I already checked that corner. So either I am mistaken, or she heard me get off the elevator and was actively moving away from me. For a moment I considered running because that shit looked like it was straight out of The Ring, but that moment of nonsense subsided and I asked her what's wrong.\n\nTurns out she was just lost and scared so I escorted her back to the concierge desk so security could help her back to her room.\n\nNothing really creepy after the fact, but for a moment, I thought she would turn around with no face or something.\n\nTLDR Found a creepy little girl crying and hugging her knees in a corner and thought I was in a horror movie.",

She also said she cant sleep unless both doors are shut and she'll often put doorstops under both doors so she hears if either door opens.\n\nShe googled some stuff and decided to sage the room and said she's had hectic nightmares since and woke up screaming late at night a few times. For reference, she was about 14 when the night terrors happened with my gf so we never told her. As i said, im a skeptic but it's still pretty creepy.",

I held his foot up until the EMTs came. They managed to save the kid's foot but he had a battle ahead of him. His foot went necrotic and he went septic(I think that's the right term) at one point but he survived.\n\nI don't work there anymore. There were a lot of unsafe practices going on and the owners didn't treat their employees very well. I left about 3 years ago and surprise surprise they shut down about a year and a half later.",

My friends and I were living on a ground floor flat and my room was at the front of the biulding, outside my window was the front garden.\n\nMy boyfriend (at the time) and I had literally just finished having sex and I put my head on the pillow and glanced to my right, which is where the window was. There was a gap between the curtain and the window and I was met with a pair eyes watching me.\n\nWe both (me and the peeper) had the instinct to look away and then quickly look back. At this point, I shouted to my ex, that there was someone watching us from outside. He jumped, opened the window and shouted various amusing warnings. He could see that the grass was disturbed so that someone had been there and by the looks of it more than once.\n\nFrom further inspection the next morning, we found out that he had jumped the small hedge and exited through my neighbours garden. \n\nI told my friends and was pretty freaked out by the whole event. However, my lovely friends decided to walk by my flat late the next night and bang on the window and make sex noises. I almost shat myself. ",

    "body": "A senior partner at the firm hitting on the receptionist. She's younger than his kids. The thing is, she's often too naive to notice, and says that he's just treating her like her uncle would, and just being friendly. I don't tell her that I've overheard him talking about jerking one out to the thought of her.\n\n\u00a0\n\nEdit: wow that blew up. I created this account because my old one got too many upvotes for me to feel comfortable.  And that was from disclosing things that happened to me like this.  I guess it's pretty topical right now.  I guess the thing to do right now is to disclose all?\n\n\u00a0\n\nI know that she's naive because she's a friend I know pretty well, and I used to be her.   I was the young naive one, coming out of the awkward teenage phase, apparently vulnerable to being preyed upon by people in positions of power, including at work, because I was too trusting and eager to please. \n\n\u00a0\n\nI was also not uneducated, but too idealistic about it. I'd heard about it happening, but at the beginning, I thought it was a thing of the past. I thought that HR and lawsuits would be a deterrent, that everything I read in the staff handbook of each company would actually be followed through, that grievances would be processed fairly.\n\n\u00a0\n\nFor example this happened to me: I was 19 when a manager took me out \"to talk about my progress and potential\" for dinner, for drinks, then \"looked after\" me. I confided in someone else at the company about what had happened, and I got a telling off (by someone else in management) because apparently I was \"spreading malicious rumours, and we will not have gossiping and bitchiness here\". That was the first but not the last time something like this happened, and in various companies, various jobs. I've developed a thick skin now, but I'm now overly guarded against people who are probably just being friendly.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt's possible that she's playing dumb, but knowing her, I think it's more likely that she's in denial. She's learnt to be polite but to keep her guard up against the younger guys (including some guys pretty high up). But  this was a guy who was friendly and kind to her despite his position from the very beginning and seemed, from her point of view, to be nurturting and she trusted him. I get it. She's not stupid, but it'll take a while until she's ready to admit it.  \n\n\u00a0\n\nI've also seen it happen to others with worse consequences. In an ideal world, yes, I would report what happened to my friend and it would be used as an example, like Weinstein, or Cosby, or Savile. But it's her decision whether she wants to be an example or not.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Our streets make two circles. I was home with my toddler, who was taking a nap. I'm on my back porch, drinking coffee. Around noon. There's a piercing scream that seems to last at least thirty seconds, I'm startled, so I go out of my fence and walk up my driveway to look around.\n\nThere's a man hauling ass down the street, cradling his arm and dripping blood on the concrete. He sees me and shouts, \"Did you see that fucking cat?! Which way did it go?!\" I saw no animal. \n\nI asked if he needed help, but he declined, saying an ambulance was on its way and just needed to find the cat. Perplexed, I pull off my long sleeve and hand it to the guy, telling him to at least wrap his injury. He holds up his arm, and his fingers are mangled. \n\n\"A *housecat* did this to you?!\" As I gently help him wrap his hand. \n\n\"This wasn't a regular cat...we just have to find him!!!!\" \n\nSo I help him look. So do a few of our neighbors. Ambulance arrives a few houses down at his place, so we walk down and sit on the curb. Suddenly, commotion from the other way and a half dozen people sprinting to the cul-de-sac to corner this animal. It disappears around a house, and we hear a volley of barking. Another man comes from behind the house, running at full speed towards the ambo. I'm still sitting with bloody guy, and running guy gives him a tissue. I almost fainted and probably would have if I were standing- in it was bloody guy's thumb and first finger, with a bit of tissue and nasty. \n\nWe never caught \"the cat\" and I didn't get a good enough look at whatever it was to figure it out. Bloody guy said he was weeding his garden and this giant black fuzzy thing with teeth and a tail chomped his hand under the bush and ran. He tried to follow it, but it was too fast. He said it stood taller than his knees, and he was like 6'5. Got his digits stuck back on properly though, and has since fenced his back yard.\n\nEdit: I guess I should explain my disclaimer, since I've had so many inquires. They found hoof-like prints in the mud under the bushes the guy was bitten in. Police came looking around to see if there was a bobcat around. No one found any other signs. ",

About 6 or 7 years ago I didn\u2019t have my license despite being far old enough to drive, but a good buddy of mine wanted to hang out. He too did not have a way of transport, so we decided to both walk towards one another and meet in the middle. We would both be walking ~5 miles. It was 3am on a cold winter night and I was wearing a black jacket with my hood up.\n\nAbout 2 miles into my hike along the main road, a car  pulled into a parking spot of a home I was passing, just a few feet behind me. He wasn\u2019t entirely into the driveway, almost half way hanging out into the road. I half expected it was just a kind stranger wanting to give me a ride, but I wasn\u2019t about to take any rides from anybody. I kept pacing forward and ignored the car behind me, expecting them to roll down a window and shout at me. It didn\u2019t happen. The car just sat at the edge of that drive way, running but completely dark inside to the point that I could only barely make out the figure of a large man.\n\nI don\u2019t typically get frightened by much, but something in the air made me tense up and my heart kind of dropped to my stomach. I stopped and turned to look at the car. I had a feeling that the person driving was watching me intently.\n\nThe figure in the car was definitely facing me; I could see the reflection from his dash bouncing off of his eyes. I stared back. I figured he was about to yell out to me, but he just sat quietly in a strangely menacing way that I have only ever seen scenes in movies play out. I kinda did a wave at the figure, letting him know I saw him and waited for some type of communication in return. He didn\u2019t budge, just stared intently. I returned to pacing away, slightly brisker.\n\nAfter just a few moments I could hear the car slowly roll in reverse, so I turned to face it but kept pacing backwards. The car kept creeping, slowly. I pulled down my hood and stood still again, waiting for him to pass me.. but instead the man slowed to a stop beside me. The passenger side window rolled down, and the man and I met eyes. \n\nNo words were exchanged at all, and before I could even let out a \u201chello?\u201d the man grimaced and accelerated away at a decent pace; almost as if he was disappointed by what he had seen. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t seem like much from how it reads, but I\u2019ll never forget how tense that interaction was for me. I\u2019ve not felt anything like it since. \n\nEdit: apparently I misunderstood the question, I apologize [8]",

One day we were exploring a mine in western Nevada. Nothing about this mine seemed creepy, and we explored quite a bit of the mine that day. However, I turned a corner inside the mine and heard a loud click. I looked up to see a pair of big, glowing, yellow eyes with more loud clicking. I didn't stick around. I ran back a few hundred feet to my partner to tell him about what I saw.  We slowly rounded the corner again to discover that it was just a juvenile owl (not sure on what kind, maybe great horned owl?). Apparently they click their beaks when they are threatened.

The creepiest part was not the bottles of liquor tumbling off the shelves or hearing a  glass after glass smash.  No.  The creepiest part was when I made it downstairs.  Everyone evacuated the restaurant pretty quick, so when I got down to the liquor store, no one was there.  There were more smashed bottles and all the booze we had just stocked in the bev fridges had tilted over.  I walk over to the kitchen side of the restaurant and there was water running and steamers on and food on the hotline, but no people.  It was surreal.  Even though I was only alone for about five minutes, it was incredibly eerie to see a business mid-operation be so empty.

    "body": "I used to work in a jewelry store. We had moved our store to another location and the new place was for sure haunted. Lights would turn on or off randomly, stuff would be moved, you'd hear stuff moving around in rooms you knew were empty, weird stuff would just happen. \n\nMy manager at first would say \"Well someone had to have moved *insert random thing that is missing* because I left it right here\" and we'd all tell her none of us touched it. Nothing would go missing in our old store so why would this just start now?\n\nShe thought we were playing a prank on her so she started watching the cameras to catch whoever was. Her tune changed really quick because you could see it dead on the camera things moving. I remember specifically a chair falling over and watching lights turn on and off when the store was closed. She was so spooked she called the owner of the buildings to see what happened to the other store managers that had rented there, were they alive? Did they report anything like this? Did anyone die here? The owner said no one ever reported anything like this. \n\nI worked there for another 2 years and we pretty much just got used to it. It never went further than hearing noises and the lights and things moving. I still talk to a few old coworkers and it's funny to look back but yeah that was def one of the freakiest things to see on camera, felt like ice down my spine. It's one thing to think weird things are happening around you but to see it on camera like that was so freaky\n",

We were really slow on Sundays and the manager just started scheduling one person to cut down on overhead.\n\nSo I'm sitting there playing minesweeper on the POS when a homeless dude wanders in. He's very clearly homeless. Old dirty clothes, pants frayed at the bottoms, split shoes. Hair looks like dust mop from the first Burning Man. Egregiously obese. *Egregiously*.\n\nI've been conditioned to be a retail robot so I ask him how he is and if he needs any help finding anything. He doesn't say anything and walks through the store, staring at me the entire time. Up and down all of the aisles like he was browsing but he was just looking at me. Still hasn't said a word.\n\nHe finishes up his circuit and then just walks behind the counter, right up next to me. \n\n\"Hey man, don't be weird. Can't be behind the counter.\"\n\nHe doesn't reply and starts going through the cabinets under the register.\n\n\"Alright, I'm gonna call the police buddy. It's Sunday and they're gonna be pissed.\"\n\nHe finds a quart of Xylene which we used to clean up spills of crazy shit sometimes. He unscrews the cap of the xylene, throws the cap across the store and looks me right in the eyes.\n\nAt this point I just start leaving. Definitely not gonna wrestle an open can of solvent from a homeless dude. But before can leave, he lifts the can above his head and empties it all over himself and drops the can. \n\n\n(Idk how familiar y'all are with xylene but that shit burns. Used to thin out and clean solvent epoxys. No way that he wasn't instantly in pain)\n\nI'm about as confused as I can be, still terrified because I'm a bitch, standing by the door. I can't think of anything to say or do and he starts walking towards me again.  My mind starts racing and I think \"Aw man he's gonna light himself on fire. Prolly gonna grab me or something. This blows. I hate this job.\"\n\nI'm frozen and my heart is pounding and then he just walks around me and leaves. Walks on down the sidewalk. \n\n\nLocked the door and closed the registers and left. Didn't even clean up the xylene. Probably stained the shit out of the floors. That shit is REAL hot. Burns the piss out of your skin if you get it on your hands. Probably burns way worse when you're covered in it.\n\nCalled the owner and told him that I closed and quit. He thanked me for locking the doors before I left.",

As the foreigner, I just got to join wherever I wanted for the day helping out - nice outside? Sweep the entryway. Raining? Gym. That sort of thing. \n\nI noticed it early on, but didn't think anything of it - I was still new to teaching in the same school all of the time (was previously at a bunch of ones randomly a few days a week), so I just brushed it off. \n\nBut I noticed it more and more. A random student, never the same one as far as I remember, mid cleaning time (which is very, very serious the younger the kids, no talking, that sort of thing) would stop mid activity, and slowly turn their heads towards me, body staying still or slowly doing whatever cleaning they were doing. And stare, eyes narrowing and just boring into you. Then it's like they'd snap out of it and be *genki* again. \n\n\"Sensei, nan yo koto?\"\n(\"Teacher, what's up?\")\n\nThis happened a couple times a month, to the point that I started finding other places to be during cleaning time (\"oh snap, I am going to wash this window waaaaaay far away from you all\").\n\nAnd it's not like the kids were surprised to see me, or something - I taught all the kids at least once every other week, and on \"off weeks\" I read stories to them or ate lunch with them. And it wasn't a joke, because it wasn't just the older kids (who know how to fuck with people), it was all grades, and honestly, most jokes involved grabbed boobs or a *kancho*. \n\nThis went on for all of the years I taught there. Just during cleaning time, and completely randomly. \n\nI don't know if it has anything to do with it, but I got to go on a field trip my last year there. We visited local \"bunkers\" - basically, farmers made these hills on their land that was just the size to fit a Zero (WWII Japanese fighter plane) in, so the American's couldn't see them from the air and bomb them. Kyushu got bombed a lot. \n\nThe guy giving the tour said that our gym was built where a big one used to be, one that held 3 planes until it was bombed out by the Americans, killing 8 people. \n\nSo... my school may or may not have been haunted by *gaijin*-hating ghosts that possessed children.

All lights including the outside ones were off. Not only that, but I'm a woman and I was only about 22 at the time so I was definitely not opening the door for them. I could hear them talking about me and saying they knew I was there and they could hear me on the stairs. I was terrified and close to tears. \n\nAfter about 20 minutes of this, it finally stopped. I waited a few more minutes before leaving the employee door (which was thankfully on the front of the building and my car was next to the door). When I went out they had left a NOTE on my car. I thought I was in the clear when suddenly, they drove up beside me in a dark empty parking lot. Apparently they forgot their glasses and wanted back in, but instead of calling or waiting til they next day they decided to accost a young girl and terrify her at midnight while she was alone. It was the scariest thing that ever happened to me at work for sure. ",

I just sat there and watched CNN on a tiny TV and waited for people to come in needing directions or patient information (most of the time for that second one the answer was \"sorry I can't provide that\" depending on the question).  \nSo it's a Wednesday afternoon around lunch time when a guy comes in and says, \"Am I a patient here?\"  Uh... so I get his ID, and no.  \"Oh thank Jesus.  My wife said she was putting me in here.  You can't let her do that.  She said she knows the doctors and they'll come take me.  They'll kill me and make it look like natural.  You can't let her put me in here.\"  \nI am literally nobody.  Just a butt in a seat.  I have no idea what's even happening.  I just told him again that he's not listed as a patient here.  Right behind me is a security lady with a list of protected identities in the hospital and she's not saying a word, so I know he's not that either, but she's making a phone call to someone to see about this guy.  \nThen this dude in scrubs shows up from inside the hospital.  He's got a badge for the facility so he's alright on that level.  He comes to me and says, \"Hey who's that guy there by the door?\"  \n\"Civilian.  Something about his wife trying to kill him.  It's crazy.  [Security lady] is on the phone right now checking his name out.\"  \n\"Hmm.  I'll handle it.  I'm [Doctor].\"  He shows me his photo badge with a rank on it high enough for me to know this shit ain't my call.  Alrighty, all yours.  \nHe goes up to the guy and speaks to him quietly, and the dude is listening.  Then the doc grabs one of the nearby loaner wheelchairs, and the dude sits in it.  He then wheels the guy *out* of the hospital and down the sidewalk out of my view.  \nAbout then the security lady hangs up the phone and says there's nothing on this guy.  At best he's a dependent.  \nAbout thirty minutes later (I don't know), a totally different guy comes in and puts the wheelchair back, gives me a smile and nod, and walks out.  Never saw the doc or the dude ever again.  I asked the security lady about it a few months later when I was on the desk rotation again, and she never saw or heard anything either.  There's a lot of \"it could be\" kind of answers when it comes to what we just saw go down, some good some bad (I'm sure I'll hear a bunch of them), but the truth is we can never be sure.\n",

But some of things she says are pretty creepy...\n\nThe creepiest of them all was this....When she was 3, we moved into a new house... And she started casually mentioning someone named Jeffrey. I don't know a Jeffrey, and she wasn't in school yet. I asked her who he was, and she quickly corrected me, saying that Jeffrey is a \"she\"... OK..... I figure she's made up an imaginary female friend with a boy's name. My kid is a whacko, I accept it. \n\nShe only mentions Jeffrey a few times a week. Jeffrey doesn't like this or that... Jeffrey has a sister... Jeffrey doesn't know how to tie her shoes. Normal shit, for the situation.... Then one day, when she was 4, she comes to me kinda giddy, and says \"Mommy, guess what!!!! Jeffrey is a BOY!! I didn't know that!! He told me today after I called him a girl\"!... I ask her why she thought Jeffrey was a girl all this time, and she says \"Because he has long curly hair like a girl, and always wears the same pajamas. And, Oh, his sister died\". \n\nOK... Whoa. I didn't think that was a normal interaction with an imaginary friend... But again, whatever... I'm not trying to hear anything else about it. \n\nWe come home one night after dark. Just her and I... And when I open the front door, I can hear the WEIRDEST sound I've ever heard in my life coming from the back of the house near my bedroom. No TVs or electronics are on... Just the light in my bedroom that I can see from the front door... I refused to go inside. Just stood in the doorway with my little weirdo, and called a friend so they could hear the noise.... It sounded kind of like a radiating, vibration with some clicks and WAAAH WAAAH WAAAH sounds, and was almost rhythmic, but not quite... I can't even really describe it.. But my friend heard it, too, and told me to run lol. \n\nI didn't run, though... I sat outside with my munchkin for a bit, and and was just about to go ask my male neighbor to check it out for me, when it suddenly stopped... My daughter was a little nervous, but I assured her it was OK to go inside. We go in, and I walk to my bedroom. Nothing is out of the ordinary. Phew... Then my daughter comes in... Looks around, and says \"OHHHH! Mommy, it's OK! It was just Jeffrey!!!\"..... I say \"WHAT?? *What* was just Jeffrey?\"... She says \"The noise... I forgot to tell you that he wants to talk to you, but you can't hear him. He made that noise so you could hear him\". \n\nWhat. The. Fuck. \n\nI don't believe in ghosts, or spirits or anything, but Holy shit, I was shook. I ask her how she knows it was him... She says \"He told me last time I saw him he was going to make a noise for you... And I know he was here, cause he painted all over the walls\". I did not see any paint on the walls, but apparently she did... She said it went away a few moments after she came in the room though. I asked her what she saw on the walls.... She said \"A tree, a sun, and letters... But all colored with black\". She couldn't read yet, and didn't remember what letters she saw. \n\nShe must've noticed I was kinda creeped out... Cause she said \"Don't worry Mommy, Jeffrey is nice. He just wants you to hear him\". I tell her OK! Bed time!...\n\nOver the next couple months, she mentions him casually a few times... Then we moved to another home. She never mentioned seeing him again after we moved. For the next year or so, every few months she'd say, \"Hey mommy, remember Jeffrey? I miss him... Can we go visit him?\"....\n\nReally fucking weird. Now, she says german phrases in her sleep. She doesn't speak German. No one she knows speaks german. I've heard her do it about 4-5 times... My fiance has heard it, to back me up, twice now. I love my little weirdo. ",

For extra income we would rent out the building for filming. \n\nOne television show had been there a few days and it was my turn to be on site to unlock the building and turn on all the lights. Now, this was early in the morning but it wasn't dark outside. However the film crew had blacked out the windows so it was very dark in the basement which would normally have a few small windows let light in. \n\nThis building was very oddly laid out lights and had even worse light switches. So the long walk down the ramp to the basement was made much worse by the fact the few small windows were blacked out. On top of this I didn't have a cell phone yet (I got one later than most people) so I couldn't use that to light the way. \n\nSo I literally walked through the pitch black running my hand along the wall to find my way. I knew where the switch was I just had to get there. Normally I would not have made that walk until I found a flash light or something because this old warehouse is creepy enough and not exactly safe to walk around without lights but the crew had arrived and I was young and felt like I needed to do my job and get those lights on asap. \n\nAfter a very slow walk using my hands on the wall and in front of my face as to not walk into anything, I reached the lights. When I turned on the switch immediately beside me was a pentagram of blood with skulls all around it. My skin scrawled in a way I've never experienced and I got the hell out of there. \n\nTurns out the show was Supernatural and they do all sorts of creepy stuff. I was just not ready to see that after a creepy walk through the pitch black. ",

We have a lot of interestng and unique items, many of which I'd nicely describe as an aquired taste. So one day, I'm working with one of my favorite co-workers next to the display case, and he is giving out samples. This woman and her daughter walk up and try some. The mother was a regular, but I'd never seen her daughter before. The daughter looked ~11-12 years old. \n\nSo my coworker is giving out samples to the two of them, and the daughter really likes an item that very few people do, most of whom are older with really interesting tastes. I'm surprised by this, so I say, \"you really like (item name)?\" in kind of a cartoonishly astonished voice, and she vigorously nods her head. The mother also thinks it's pretty good, but hesitates when she hears the price. Totally fine, happens all the time. She says maybe she'll come back for it when she's entertaining guests. \n\nSo they walk off and my co-worker and I continue working. About 20 minutes later, the daughter comes back up to the case with this expectant look in her eye, and my co-worker is like \"did you come back for (item name)?\" and she again nods vigorously. We then see her mother smiling and nodding at us, and indicating to her daughter where she'll be once her daughter has secured the goods. So my coworker sets about getting her her stuff, and I'm just making small talk with the kid as I'm working, and I ask again \"so you like, REALLY like (item name) then huh?\" and she again agrees enthusiastically. My co-worker goes to hand the parcel over to her and as she grabs it, i ask her, kind of jokingly \"aren't you a little too young to like that kinda stuff?\" Because really, I'd never seen anyone under like 30 like it. \n\nShe takes a step closer to me, leans in, amd says, as seriously and with as much honey as you could imagine, \"I'm not too young for *anything*,\" the emphasis being on \"anything.\" I just look with my eyebrows raised, and tell her to enjoy that, and turn around and walk away with literal goosebumps on my arms. \n\nWhat's worse is, apparently she came back on a day I wasn't there, asking my manager about me specifically, like my name and stuff, and my manager came to me and asked \"why was she looking for you, like how do you know her?\" \n\nI'm really freaked out by it.

    "body": "I'm an IT consultant.  Many years ago, I built a network for a small consulting company that supported the Federal government.  They have very specific rules about printing documents (primarily because of client confidentiality and sensitivity).  Certain users had remote capabilities, but absolutely no-one was ever allowed to print remotely.  Each print job also had a \"cover sheet\" that printed first to show who printed the document and what date and time it was printed.  If anyone left their documents on the printer, the coversheet would say and they could get written up for it.  The job of the last employee to leave each night was to go around to all six printers in the office and make sure no documents were left on any of the printers.  \n\n\nOne night very late, I was doing an upgrade for a non-related system, and was walking around the office in between tasks, mostly to keep blood flowing to my brain and to not fall asleep staring at a stupid progress bar move to the right.\n\n\nI walk by a printer and notice a piece of paper on it.  Odd, I thought, that's not right.  What's even stranger is I can totally tell that that it is a single piece of paper.  It's strange because the cover sheet should be page one, and so every print job is a minimum of two pages.\n\n\nNow because of the confidentiality and such, I am torn between looking at the print job and leaving it there.  But because I am the only one in the office until tomorrow morning, and because I know that the last employee in the office who left at 7:00 PM did the nightly printer sweep, and because I know for a fact that no-one can print remotely, I'm intrigued by this page.  So curiosity gets the better of me, and I look at the document.  \n\n\nIt's two words.  \"I know\"  But \"I\" was at the top.  And \"know\" was one third of the way down and center justified.\n\n\nBecause it had no cover page, I thought it was best to simply shred it, so I put it into the shredder as I pass.\n\n\nAn hour or two later, I do another walk around the office, and at different printer, there's another page.  That's really weird, I think.  Again, I look.  Two words.  \"I see\" same thing, \"I\" at the top left.  \"see\" 1/3 down, middle justified.\n\n\nShred again.\n\n\nThirty minutes later, doing another walk.  This time, I walk by a printer and it starts up as I walk by!  Page spits out.\n\n\nOne word\n\n\n\"you\"\n\n\nThis page, I save, fold and shove into my pocket.  The last two pages I had shredded.  This one, I keep.  I don't know why.  I'm trying to stay composed, but I worked quickly to finish my job, clearly kinda freaking out and looking over my shoulder ever few seconds.  I go between jokingly saying \"the printing is coming from INSIDE THE HOUSE\" and imagining about how detectives will be scratching their heads looking over my mangled body the next day and will find the piece of paper in my pocket that says \"you\".  I'm in a data room, and I turn my laptop to face the only door inbound.  But I'm really really nervous and trying to joke to myself to keep me from freaking out.\n\n\nI finish my work, pack up, run by all the printers, quickly, no more pages.\n\n\nI go to the 24 hour garage where I am parked.  It was not one of those self-park garages, and it was staffed by a person who took your ticket and fetched your car from the garage and drove it up to you.\n\n\nI get to the garage, I don't see the attendant.

So I think, well, it's late, they probably are taking a piss break or something, so I look for a call button.  I find it and press the button.  No response.  \n\n\nI wait what is probably like one minute, but an ETERNITY to me and press the button again.\n\n\nNothing.\n\n\nI wait and I press the button again.\n\n\nAnd a voice comes through the speaker.\n\n\n\"I see you\"\n\n\nI'm really freaking out at this point until the guy continues....\n\n\n\"I'll be right there, sir\"\n\n\nA few minutes later the attendant appears, nice guy, nothing weird. Gets my car.  I go home.  Didn't sleep.\n\n\nTL:DR Working in office late one night.  Printers start printing creepy stuff.",

I pour a cup and go sit in my office and check news, sports scores, Reddit, etc...it\u2019s been my little routine for about 3 years now. My morning coffee is the only peace and quiet I get all day and I cherish it. Until last week.   \nI was down in my office and I thought I heard footsteps coming from the walkway upstairs. I swiveled in my chair to see if I could see anything but the noise stopped. My dog was sitting next to me and I know she heard something too because her ears were perked up. After a minute, what sounds like a door closing. At this point, I\u2019m wondering if I really heard it or did I need more coffee. I check the babycams on my phone and no movement from the kids rooms. I just chalked it up to not enough coffee and went about my morning.  \nTHIS WENT ON FOR TWO MORE NIGHTS!  Friday morning, I pour my coffee and as I\u2019m walking out the kitchen, I hear the footsteps right above me. I knew the door was going to shut next so I pulled up the baby cam App just in time to see my little 3y/o run into her room, close the door, and jump in bed like she was asleep! I went up and opened her door and softly asked if she was awake, and she thankfully said yes. Evidently she\u2019s been waking up at 4:30 and walking around upstairs but didn\u2019t want to get in trouble so she\u2019d hide anytime she heard someone!! ",

They REALLY like dolls.\"\nThen the daughter led me back to the living room and kitchen. \n\nY'all. \n\nThe living room was so full of dolls, I couldn't see the sofa. They were two feet thick on the floor, every available surface was covered in dolls. Creepy dead eyes EVERYWHERE.  \n\nIf there were less than 500 dolls in that room I would be shocked. \n\nIn the kitchen, we sat down at the table, and the daughter had to move dolls onto the floor to give me room to sit on a chair. They were NAILED TO THE WALLS. \nLike nails through the fabric of their dresses, just hanging there with their little arms limp. \n\nI had never seen so many dolls in my LIFE. \n\nThere were big ones, tiny ones, all dressed in frilly dresses, and my GOD the dust.  I have horrible allergies and I could not breathe. \n\nI did my work and got the fuck out as quickly as I could. The daughter was so nonplussed about the whole thing, it was obvious she had lived with these things her whole life. That poor, poor woman. \n\nAs I was waiting in the kitchen for her to go get the patient, I snapped a pic of the living room, but this was several years ago, and I didn't post it anywhere because HIPAA, but I think it's still on an old phone somewhere. \n\nCREEPIEST SHIT EVER. \n\nI called report into the office and they asked if I was going to keep the patient for myself and I quickly responded \"NO THANK YOU\". They couldn't keep a nurse in the house. Everyone was creeped out by the dolls and the patient. \n\nThe man had NO facial expression and the most monotonous voice I had ever heard. His eyes were just as dead as the dolls, and as I think back on it, he had passed this creepy lack of emotion and expression to his daughter, or they had just lived in the Valley of the Dolls so long, they were adopting what they were seeing every day. \n\nI'll look to see if I can find the picture somewhere.

About 5 minutes into clearing the parking lot, I notice probably 500 feet away, somebody standing, watching me from the back of the property. \n\nAt first I thought it was a resident walking around, but they didn't move a muscle for a good 10 minutes, and right before I was about to call the police, the figure disappeared.

    "body": "I used to work at a gym in a large Canadian city, which catered to an affluent neighbourhood. One day in the afternoon when it was slow, two men rang the buzzer that signalled to the office to come and let them in. Both were friendly upbeat personalities, and I sat them down in the office to chat about membership prices, which is what the one friend was after. \n\nThey openly chatted with me, and the man who was interested in the membership indicated that he was a Priest. The other man identified himself as an actor, and would ask questions and evaluate my responses on behalf of the Priest, relaying whether the information I provided was good for the Priest's fitness goals. The Priest was a bit off but I didn't let that phase me, as I needed more membership sales for the month and he seemed seriously interested.\n\nCut to the creepy part. The Priest stops me mid-info and asks if the building had a basement. I said that it had, but that it was a staff area (where laundry, the break room and a office of accounting files was.) He asked if it had double-doors, or space that indicated there were double doors. I said no. He asked if I was sure. I said yes. He said, that he believed this place used to be a morgue, and that if there were double doors, that it would check out. I again said, no, no double doors. And that the building was not old enough to have been anything other than the gym it had been for the last twelve years. He didn't look like he took my word for it but I let it roll off and proceeded to show them the small gym's features.\n\nWhile upstairs in the open-floor work out space, they inquired about the scale-like thing in the corner, I replied that it was a Tanita, and explained how it worked. (For reference, http://images.shape.mdpcdn.com/sites/shape.com/files/styles/slide/public/inbody-400x400_0.jpg ) Upon hearing how it operated, the Priest completely changed his demeanour. He went on an odd half-rant about how he could not be around this machine and that it disturbed him for moral, physical, mental and spiritual levels, \"I do not like this for moral reasons. I do not support this for physical reasons. And I certainly am uncomfortable for spiritual reasons.\" - More or less what he said. His friend tried to reason with him, now showing me that this was a tad too far for even the Actor's understanding of the guy. Then the actor tried to reason with me, \"could you keep it in the office? Could we move it away and could the trainers only bring it out when necessary?\" I explained that it was heavy, and that it was most functional and frequently used by the trainers, so that no, we could not accommodate this request. The Priest retorted that he refused to work out even in the same building as this device, that even if it was moved, he would \"know it was here.\"\n\nAny who, the Actor apologized and said that he'd talk with him, and they went on their way. Later, when questioned about why I was not following up on the lead by my supervisor, I told her what I had experienced. She went over my head and contacted him anyways. When I found out that she had met with him again when I wasn't there, I asked her about the experience. She's usually very pushy with sales, and would expect I be the same, but in this case she just mumbled something about it not being a good fit, and turned back to her desk. I didn't push for more details but was kind of happy that I wasn't the only one completely and utterly weirded out by this guy.\n\nTL;DR: Actor and Priest walk into a gym (sounds like a bad joke, right?) ... Priest says with unwarranted confidence that gym was once a morgue (gym was never a morgue,) then bugs out about a fancy electronic scale for \"spiritual reasons.\"",

    "body": "That is creepy! I really wish that the police would offer some kind of closure for people who report crimes like this. \n\nYears ago (early 90's), my boyfriend was driving me home and we saw a man lying on the ground in the strangest position. Kneeling, with his head on the ground and bent at a sharp angle so that he faced the street. It was two in the morning and the man was covered in sweat with his eyes open. We pulled over and I hopped out of the car to check on this guy. His eyes were wide open and he seemed like... his face wasn't moving, but it really felt like he was pleading for help. He didn't respond at all when called out to him. No blinking, glassy eyes. I reached out to touch him and he was ice cold. I'm sure he wasn't breathing. \n\nThis was before cell phones, so I hopped back in the car and we sped back to my house to call 9-1-1. Ten minutes later, the police called back to ask for the cross streets again. Apparently, they arrived at the corner and there was nothing there. I verified that they had the right spot and they said they would call back if they needed any more information. That was the last I ever heard about it. I checked the newspaper for the next few weeks, but we never found out anything else about that man. \n\nAnyway, if anyone reading this has some suggestions to throw out about what may have happened to that man (Massive heart attack? Some kind of seizure?), I'd be grateful for your insight. ",

    "body": "I was ambling down an old country highway in NW Georgia on my motorcycle (750 Vulcan) when I spotted an ambulance coming the opposite way.  I pulled over, and a pickup truck pulled over behind me.  In my rear-view mirror I see the passenger get out with a baseball bat and start hustling my way.  I didn't even look, just dropped it into gear and hauled ass.  What followed was the most harrowing experience I've had in life as this pickup truck proceeds to chase me all over the place for about 20 minutes.  I'm unfamiliar with the area and my bike was not meant for going fast around turns, so I've got no room for error and it's all I can do to stay out in front of these guys.  I'm blowing through four-way intersections in a bid to get some distance and come up with a plan, but they are hell-bent on catching me.  I finally manage to get pointed towards the highway and into the cover of other cars, but then traffic stops on a bridge.  The truck is three cars behind me, and I'm thinking if I can just get out to the highway I'm probably home free because my Vulcan *can* go fairly fast in a straight line.  In my mirrors I can see that passenger snaking through the cars on the bridge, so I lane split (illegal in GA) and make the on-ramp, hammer down and I'm gone baby gone.  \n\nNever went back to that town.  As far as I know this was an unprovoked attack of the hillbilly variety, because prior to the ambulance I hadn't even seen another vehicle, I don't ride particularly fast, and I don't believe in loud pipes.  I got lucky as hell, seeing him come up behind me like that.",

Instead of walking, we drove so we could hatch eggs faster. We didn't drive faster than 20 and it worked. So, we've been doing this same route for about a week. Down all the same residential streets, etc. We would frequently stop and park next to this empty lot because there were always good Pokemon. One night we did this, and people who lived in the house across the street came outside, stood on their porch some 30 yards away, and shined a spotlight on us. Super weird... so we got ready to leave. Then this truck drives next to us and asks if we're okay. We say \"Yep, just playing Pokemon Go\" and we show him the phones. He leaves. So, as we're driving away, we notice this truck is following us. Kinda weird. So, we head out on the main drag and the truck is getting increasingly more aggressive. Driving up next to me as I'm driving and shining a blinding light at me. We are freaking out at this point. So, we eventually lose them and my fiance and I switch places, so now he's driving because I was freaking out. We start to head home and the truck found us again. This time they are out for BLOOD. We must have drove 75 on residential streets, blew through people's yard, etc trying to lose these people. Nothing worked. I was sobbing on the phone with 911 begging them to help us. We ended up driving through this tree-laden yard. Totally fucked up my car. The truck pinned us in, and 3 huge dudes and a girl hop out and start walking towards us. My fiance manages to get the car out and we're flying through our little town. It was so dark and we were so turned around. The truck was able to pin us in again. This time, my fiance drew his gun and ordered them to \"back the fuck off\" several times. They sped away. I asked 911 to have the police meet us at the local convenience store. (Earlier on we tried to go to the police station, but none of the cars were there so we kept moving) We get to the convenience store and the cops are there. 10 seconds later, the truck shows up. Driver jumps out and charges our vehicle. Cops restrain him. They talk to them for awhile and come back to us, demanding if we pulled a gun. We say yes, explain why. They say that the people who chased us had people break into their house recently so they were scared. We were floored. That gave them a right to do this? The cops said we were lucky they didn't press charges about the gun. We didn't sleep well for days. ",

Basically a four sided box set on an old wood pallet. Buddy was standing on the edge of said pallet when they hit a bump. He fell off. Forklift ran over his foot and pressed the top of it onto his leg. It didn\u2019t cut him or anything. It TORE his foot open and snapped his tendons. No broken bones though.

It was the auditory expression of pure...darkness. It wasn't even that it seemed evil like a demon kind of thing, only that it was the sound of infinite nothingness, and was eagerly wanting to devour me. She made herself known from outside my backdoor, to the hallway, and then opened my bedroom door. Once she opened the door her voice flooded my head, though it was louder in the ear facing the direction she was coming from, which made it feel pretty fucking real. Once she was next to my bed, the voice was encompassing everything. My room fell away, my bed fell away. It was just me and her in the milky black. She was poised to consume me, I could feel my eminent doom, but then I remembered something I promised myself as I grew up watching many horror films. It always seemed like a better idea to keep your eyes open when faced with something frightening, otherwise the waiting between the point of closing your eyes and possible destruction will feel like an eternal hell. So with that in mind, and a bit of, \"man, fuck you!\" gumption courtesy of my grandma and mom, I thought to myself, \"if you're going to swallow me whole, I'm going to look you in the fucking eyes! Fuck yooooou!\" \n\nOpened my eyes to face her, was back in my room, laying in bed as I was in paralysis, only now I was awake for real, in a blissfully, beautifully quiet room.\n\nHaven't seen her since. That was one of 3 times sleep paralysis has actually rendered something frightening. Usually I just lay there being aware of how comfortable I am in my bed, and how great it feels to be so incredibly still.",
