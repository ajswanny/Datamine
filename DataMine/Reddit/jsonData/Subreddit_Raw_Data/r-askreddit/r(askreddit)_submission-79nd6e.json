    "body": "Adding TLDR: gut instinct felt something was off when I saw two men 'helping' another man - turns out he was dead and they were just ditching his body.\n\nA few years ago, about 1am Sunday morning, I had to take my dog out before bed. I live in a rough neighbourhood and I am a female so I usually have my guard up regardless of the time.\nBefore I left the apt building my gut told me something was up. The street was completely void of traffic and people except for a van parked out to the side of the road. Outside of it were three people whom I quickly identified as male. Right away my reaction is to keep my head low, put my jacket hood up and not bring attention to myself. \nOut of the corner of my eye, I could see they were struggling; on closer inspection I see two of the men are holding up the other man between them. I make the assumption that they are headed home after a night of heavy partying and they are just helping their friend get sick or something. I am telling myself this to ease my fears. Then they notice me and they stop everything and freeze. I thought that was odd and no good so I drag my dog straight back to my building (I don't even know if he got the chance to pee that night!)\nI go to bed and thinking nothing more of it... until it's time to take the dog out again in the morning. There was a notice in the elevator asking for witnesses as to exactly what I saw that evening because a dead body had been found. \nSo... this wasn't a friend of theirs after all.... they were ditching a body. \nStill upsets me today and I will never ignore my intuition again. \n",

    "body": "Registered nurse here. They pretty much tell us straight off the bat in nursing school to trust our guts. We're allowed to call a rapid response team (people who come when something very bad is happening to a patient) if the patient \"just doesn't look right\" to us. \n\nI got my job right out of nursing school in a department that deals with mothers and babies right after delivery. I was 22 years old, had no children of my own, and my only experience with newborns was my last six months on the job.\n\nI had this patient and her baby who both seemed to be doing well. The baby's weight, vital signs, and intake and output were all normal, but I felt like something wasn't right. For one thing, I had never heard this baby cry. Anyone who has ever been anywhere around newborns know that they can pretty much cry at the drop of a hat, for anything, at any time. This baby didn't cry when I put her on the scale to weigh her (They usually cry like you're actively trying to kill them), or when I pricked her heel for a blood sugar. I felt like a total idiot because I had almost no experience with newborns, but I decided to talk to someone anyway. \n\nI brought the baby to the nursery nurse, who has had over 20 years experience in the department, and told her that I thought something was up. The baby looked fine. Her vitals, including her blood sugar, were perfectly normal. However, the baby was floppy (not a technical term, but used to describe a baby when its arms and legs aren't curled up tightly next to the body like they're supposed to be. This baby's arms and legs were limp and stretched out). She had a poor grasp (she didn't tighten her fingers around our fingers like newborns are supposed to do) and when we could get her to cry (we barely could), her cry was weak. \n\nThe nursery nurse agreed that something was wrong and called the neonatologist (newborn baby doctor) who was on call that night. She spent about 20 minutes on the phone just trying to tell him that something wasn't right, even though everything was technically normal. Luckily, the neonatologist trusted her judgement and had us send the baby to the NICU. \n\nThat baby ended up staying in NICU for about a month, being tube fed because she stopped eating well. They did genetic testing on her and discovered that she had been born with a pretty rare (only 30,000 cases diagnosed annually in the US) genetic disorder that usually isn't diagnosed until the baby is unable to sit up on their own at about 6 months of age. The disorder has no cure, but doctors were able to start treatments on her in order to manage some of the symptoms almost immediately.",

    "body": "When I was in university I was walking home from the bars in the Byward Market in Ottawa with my roommate at the time. It was about 230am and we were looking forward to getting home and ordering some pizza when we came across two guys and a very drunk girl. Initially we didn't think anything about it because it was a pretty common sight on a Friday, but as we walked behind them for a few minutes we noticed how out of it she was. One of the guys was essentially carrying her, and her clutch was loosely dangling from her limp wrist. Our street came up, but instead of turning down it we decided to see what was going on. The guys explained that she was one of their girlfriends and had too much to drink so they were taking her home. We asked them a few more questions: what bar they were at, where she lived, if she was an Ottawa U student etc... They gave pretty convincing answers but all the same seemed really uncomfortable and wanted us to go away. During the conversation the guy holding his \"girlfriend\" shifted her position to get a better grip, which caused her arm to dangle down and drop her clutch. Before they could move, my roommate grabbed the clutch and took out her ID. My roommate then asked if they knew her first and last name along with her birthday. This is where things changed. The other guy got really aggressive and confrontational while the other went silent. They didn't know her name OR birthday. I then pulled out my phone and called police. The guy dropped her and they took off running. We waited with her for about ten minutes until the police and EMS got there. We gave a statement but did not have much to go on other than their descriptions. Police told us they suspected she had been dosed, and that she was lucky we happened to be walking behind her. Pretty scary stuff.\n\n\nUpdate: Thanks for all the kind words and my first ever gold. It was a pretty surreal experience, but I would like to think that most people would have acted the same way.",

One of the patients she was looking after was a very boisterous person in her 40s and she had been in the hospital for over a week. One night mum noticed this lady was very lethargic, saying that she was just feeling tired and was going to have an early night and to get her meds early (this isn't going where you expect).\nMum thinks this is very odd for this lady, but everyone has off days and so she gives this lady her medication and she goes off to bed. about 5 min passes and mum still has a knot in her gut about this lady, and thinks she will just check her stats, so she goes to her room, where the lady is just about to lay down and checks her blood pressure, pulse and Oxygen saturation. This is pretty rarely done in a psych hospital unless people have other health concerns needing monitoring. This lady's Oxygen saturation was down to around 80% I believe (doing the best to recall), to put it in perspective if it falls below 92% your cells can't absorbe oxygen and this can cause permanent damage. Mum in her over 40 years of nursing (wasn't always a psych nurse) has never seen someone with such a low level. She checks again and the same result. Mum calls an ambulance and gets this lady on oxygen. \nLater that night mum gets a call from the hospital the patient was sent to, from the doctor who lets mum know that the lady is fine. She had a blood clot. If she had been left for another 15 minutes the doctor is certain she would have died. The lady made a full recovery and gave mum a beautiful scarf the next time she saw her.\n\nEdit: i just checked and i was very wrong with the 80%. It had dropped to 33% https://imgur.com/a7gGVX7\n\nEdit 2: my first gold! Thank you. You are a legend and people of your desired gender find you smart and attractive.",

Originally posted by /u/rwbingham in [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/xa4d9/reddit_what_is_the_creepiest_true_story_some_one/c5kocv2/), five years ago.\n\n> It was near Halloween time when my friends and I were telling ghost stories. My friend said she was going to tell a story about her parents' first date. She said she didn't like telling the story, since it was actually true, but we prodded her on.\n> \n> To cut to the chase, the parents had spent a nice, if awkward first date, and around the time that they would have said \"good night,\" the male in the situation--my friend's dad--suggested that they go for a midnight hike up Provo Canyon. He apparently knew the place, since he had done a fair amount of rock climbing in the area. So the two drove up the mouth of the canyon, got out of their cars and started hiking under just the light of the stars, since it was a new moon.\n> \n> At some point, the male starts getting a \"bad feeling,\" since the pathway ahead, which would pass under some trees, would be dark, and because it was getting to be quite late. He ignores the feeling and presses on. In later rehearsings of the story, the female would say that she had felt the same feeling at what was probably the same time, though she didn't know the trail like he did. A minute later, the feeling came back to the male. He ignored it again, and started walking a bit of the way into the trees when his foot hit something \"soft\" in the middle of the path. Under the trees, it was too dark to see just what this soft thing was, and the feeling came back stronger than ever. Instead of finding out what his foot had bumped into, he and the female both agreed to hightail it out of there...\n> \n> Years later, after being married for some time, they were watching an interview with the serial killer, Ted Bundy. In response to a question asking him to describe the time that he felt the closest to being caught, he explained about the night that he lured a girl into Provo Canyon, and had just killed her when he heard some people coming up the trail. He explained how he hid in the trees just in time, only to watch some guy walk right into the body, and for some reason, just turn around and walk away.\n> \n> TL;DR. Friend's parents stumbled onto a fresh corpse left by Ted Bundy on their first date.\n",

She has pretty good instincts about people, so we decided to investigate him a bit.\n\nTyping his whole name into Google, the *first* result was a mug shot from a couple of years ago.  The third was an active warrant.  More searching resulted in finding three warrants from different counties, an extensive record (check deception, theft, driving while suspended, driving after a lifetime suspension, and driving while a habitual traffic offender), and a brand-new marriage license for him and my daughter.  They were going to get married later that week.\n\nWe, of course, told her about him, but she insisted that he'd already told her about all of that and had \"taken care of it.\"  We emailed links to her roommate, who showed her, but she didn't have any luck talking her out of the relationship.  They were in love, and everything would work out OK in the end.\n\nWe sent in an anonymous tip, and he was arrested the next day at her apartment.  My daughter then found out that he'd been lying to her about pretty much everything.  He had entangled her in a business he was trying to start that mostly involved her financing things for him, because his credit was trash due to records for bounced checks and theft.  She's still working to untangle herself from that.\n\nHe is still in jail, and, according to her lawyer, will be for at least two years depending on what happens in two other counties.",

So I went around to all the isofluorine chambers (odorless volatile liquid that KOs mammals at low doses and kills them at higher) looking for leaks. Sure enough the gasket at the bottom of one of the chambers had failed and it was leaking out and immediately boiling into a gas, and filling the room. I told them their isofluorine was leaking, and the post doc told me they were fine and that he uses that machine all the time. He also pointed out that the isofluorine was in a air curtained biosafety cabinet and so even with the leak they were protected. I called him an idiot, because a biosafety cabinet recirculates air and doesn't evacuate it like a fume hood (which is what he should have been using). \n\nSo I ignored him, propped open the door, and ordered the undergrads to get out of the room.

    "body": "I was climbing and cutting a dead tree, box elder, also known as an ash maple. It was wedged between two houses, so I had both neighbors splitting the bill and they were all out in the yard watching me. The wind was high and I was moving around a lot in the canopy, about sixty feet up. It was beyond sea-sick levels of sway, but I'm used to worse. I don't know what it was exactly that was tipping me off subconsciously, maybe it was something about the sound of the wood creaking that seemed off to me. Maybe when I was climbing my spurs were making the wrong noise. The wood definitely felt solid, I never hit a mushy spot on the way up. The plan was to top it out and slide down the main stem, lowering limbs with rigging, and then flop the pole nice and neat. \n\nEverything seemed routine, but I kept getting goose bumps and it was creeping me out. I wish I could say I had a real clue, but there weren't any signs of trouble, nothing obvious, but there it was, that horrible feeling of fear. Like, that feeling which is so physical it makes you keep questioning your bladder every five seconds. \n\nI didn't always trust my gut, but, having been taught that lesson enough times in life, I tend to go on high-alert nowadays. To the point where I'm nearly superstitious. So, I just unhooked my lanyards and came down. Justified it by thinking, well, it's probably time for lunch anyway (it wasn't even close, it was like 9am).... I gave an excuse, packed up the truck and went home. \n\nI remember I called my old mentor, whose wife had just given birth, just to talk to him and see how things were going. He started talking about his baby, and about how his little brother had been born premature, and they were worried about that happening. Then he rambled off on a tangent, mentioned the time his brother broke his back when a douglas fir decided to barber chair on him while he was tied in about twenty feet up. Said neither of them saw it coming. Only thing that saved him was quick work on the part of their crane operator. \n\nI ate, showered, and having run out of excuses, I finally went back. Bucked all the limbs, and cut the top off, but that fear of the barber chair was ripe. I couldn't shake it. So, I went the extra step of using my 5/8ths line, one of my strongest rigging ropes, (holds 26K plus) to marl the base of the trunk up to about 30ft. It was a massive waste of time, but whatever, once the quote is accepted, I'm not working hourly, so who cares, right? Fucking sure enough, when we went to bring the pole down, it splintered and popped open like it was only being held together by spit and chewing gum. \n\nIf we hadn't reinforced it, with serious mummy-wraping, it would have hospitalized either me, or my groundsman, and then done god knows how many tens of thousands of dollars worth of damage to the clients' houses. I wish I could say I learned something about tree assessment from that experience, but I didn't. It just gave me one more in a long list of examples of why I absolutely have to trust my gut, and take every precaution I can. I think the vast majority of the data processing our brains do, is entirely subconscious, and there's just no way for us to ever make that a conscious process without turning ourselves into autistic savants. So the best we can do is not-ignore-it. \n\nedit: I'd like to add this comment by GreyWulfen [Link](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/79nd6e/when_did_your_something_is_very_wrong_here/dp4i1bs/)\n\n> the way it was swaying in the wind but not WITH the wind\n\nholy shit that didn't occur to me at all, I kept guessing creaking noises might have been the tell... but if you cut a straw from the middle down... and then bend it....\n",

They investigated and it turns out the pastor was going to their home when they weren't there and \"spending time\" with that little boy in his bedroom. They didn't give me any more details than that but it was implied that something sexual had been going on. \n\nI don't know what happened to him after that but he was obviously removed as pastor from the church.

    "body": "This was something like 12 years ago, I was around 15 years old. My dad and uncles often chop down trees to cut and sell (not a native so I dont know the correct terminology), basically they make firewood to sell. None of them does this for a living, they all have other jobs, but since my grandfather did this his whole life, they all know how to do it and since my family owns some land, they kinda maintain my late granddad business at some capacity, working mainly at weekends and it works something like an hobby they all enjoy and get some money out of it. All this to say, that even tho they \"know what to do\" they are not experts or respect every safety measure.\n\n\nSo me and a cousin were with them on the woods one Saturday, she is one year younger than me and my dad and uncles were just getting ready to chop down a huge eucalyptus\u2026they tied the tree with ropes and were cutting it to fall down where near the road, where they had the trucks nearby, to carry it after cutting it in pieces. They told me and my cousin to go furthest into the wood, basically to the opposite side where the tree was going to land...they were about to do it and I can\u2019t explain but I was getting the sensation of \u201cthe tree is going to land on us\u201d\u2026I started to move and told my cousin to follow, she tells me no, she wants to see the tree getting cutted\u2026\u201dwe start to hear the noises of the chainsaws, they have started it\u201d\u2026I tell her I feel the tree is going to hit us\u2026a debate starts and she basically refuses to leave, that her dad told us to be there and they know what to do, don\u2019t be such a pussy\u2026\nI leave her there and go further way, since I cant shake the feeling that the tree is going to land on that spot\u2026I then, decide to come back because I was so sure my cousin was going to get hurt and the only thing I can think of is stealing her cap to piss her off and she might move\u2026I proceed to do it, it works and she starts to chase me\u2026after less than a minute the tree fells RIGHT ON THE SPOT WE WERE BEFORE! The fucking tree, landed the opposite side where my dad and uncles intended to\u2026we then start to hear them screaming because they thought we were hit by it. They come running and saw us both paralyzed, me with an hand still holding her cap\u2026\nBasically what happened was, the 2 ropes broke and the wind was pushing in our direction\u2026and even with the tree being cutted towards the other way, it still fell \u201cwrong\u201d\u2026my dad was almost hit by it as well, since they weren\u2019t expecting it.\nI can\u2019t explain it, I don\u2019t believe in signs or anything supernatural, I also don\u2019t know shit about cutting trees and tbh I don\u2019t remember noticing the wind as well\u2026I just felt something in my gut that we weren\u2019t safe\u2026\nThe good part is, me and that cousin, have an love-hate relationship and every time I am about to lose an argument I go: \u201cShut up\u2026I saved your life!\u201d and sometimes, it works !\n",

One evening, a few guys went out to try \"bouldering\" - climbing boulders 10-15 metres high.

My mom and sister are very close; her being the first born, the only girl and us being a Lebanese family. Anyways, they talk through out the day quite a bit, daily. Around 6:30pm, my sister is not answering phone calls or texts. My brother and I think she's asleep or just doing whatever and it's nothing to worry about. By 7:15, still nothing from my sister and my Mom at this point is pretty much saying \"Something is wrong here, I can just feel it.\" We still don't believe her but it's not her style to worry and she is really now worrying. I call up her now ex-husband who was at a conference saying we haven't heard from my sister. It turns out neither has he. I asked if he knew her iTunes credentials so I could track her phone. Turns out she was at home. We called a friend, sent someone knocking at her door and no answer.\n\nMy mom started driving there and made the decision that we need to break into the house. She texted her friends to kick the door down. They did and found my sister unconscious. She had a major stroke, and a concussion.\n\nThe aftermath was very, very difficult. I won't write a novel and be brief. Major stroke, concussion and required open heart surgery. Was told she may never talk and would likely be a vegetable and if we actually wanted to proceed with the surgeries. We did. She's alive, she talks, she can walk with a cane and will at some point, walk without a cane. She lost everything on the left side of her body. The only part of her that may never come back is her left arm.\n\n**EDIT** : Wow my inbox blew up. Was not expecting that.  First and foremost, thank you everybody for the nice words. I'll try and clarify the whole thing. She was born with a heart condition (no idea what it's called) that was never an issue until she was about 35 years old. She went to the doctor (wasn't feeling well) they did some tests and they told her she needed to have open heart surgery and she went through that. 12 months later, she recovered and her life was back to normal and that was the end it. Fast forward a few years and this is how it played out: The stroke was a cause of a bacteria that crystallised around the heart. Every time her heart would beat, this crystallised mass would just sway like a pendulum and one day, it snapped and shot straight to her brain. So, the heart needed be cleaned up and was suffering a stroke all at once. To those asking about Botox, she does use it for her hand because it tends to stay locked in a claw-like state. Again, thank you for nice the words everyone. She's a fighter. It will take however long it has to.  Some days are better than others. I'm hoping she can walk without a cane come my wedding.",

Coworker was annoyed, but did it since her house was only 20 mins away.\n\nCoworker gets there and it turns out she had overdosed on some sort of opioid, and then had a heart attack. Oxygen levels were extremely low, and paramedics said that if coworker hadn't gotten home when she did, SIL would have been dead within minutes. Thank god her husband had felt that something was wrong. Always go with your gut.\n\nEdit if anyone is curious: This happened last Wednesday. Today is Monday and this morning they finally let her out of the ICU and into an actual room. Her heart and liver were extremely damaged, but looks like they're on the mend. She had to undergo dialysis yesterday, and it seems to have helped her a lot. They tried to get her to stand up and walk to a chair on Saturday, but it did not go well and I don't think they've tried again yet. Her speech is a little slower than it used to be, but other than that it looks like she doesn't have any brain damage. With nobody knowing the timeline of when everything happened, they were very worried that she did some real damage to herself from having such low oxygen for an extended period of time. Once she can finally check out of the hospital, she will be going to rehab (even though coworker and family believe this was only a one time thing). Luckily she lives on the first floor of my coworker's house, so if there are any long term medical conditions, they will be around to help her.",

    "body": "I'll throw out an opposite one. This was in the late 1990s. Boarding a flight from Dallas to Denver (TWA) on a MD-80. It's evening. The women behind me are clearly worried about flying and it's annoying me, so I grab a book and read to distract myself (no electronics on take off then, remember?).\n\nAnyway, we take off and pretty quickly after we take off the plane slows down and the flight attendent gets up from the back and scurries to the front. The ladies behind me are again panicing \"Thats not normal!!!\" and I'm just rolling my eyes, you always slow down a bit after take off! My gut says we're cool. THEN after about 2 minutes the plane executes a really sharp turn and the pilot comes on the announcer. Ok, this isn't normal now. \n\n\"Ladies & Gentlemen, we're returning to the airport, please ensure your seatbelts are fastened\". Quiet for a bit and then he comes on again to tell us what happened \"We lost an engine, this happens all the time, oh and you may notice a few emergency vehicles on the runway but thats just normal procedure\". \n\nAs we land I see what looks like every single fire truck at DFW lined up beside the runway. We land without major issue, people clap, and then the pilot breaks us the real news,\n\n\"Uh, so I've trained for that many times in a simulator, but its a once in a career experience for a commercial airline pilot\".\n\nSo my gut was wrong, I was sure there was nothing wrong and there was.\n\nEdit: I was trying to look up if there was a log of this incident. It would have been 1998 or maybe 1997 (or 1999) I think and the flight was either DFW to Denver or DFW to St Louis on TWA. I know for sure we did our abort in the dark because I remember the lights on the firetrucks, so evening flight.\n\nEdit: I think this is me. Looks like it was Delta which means that IIRC I was rebooked onto a TWA flight to get to my destination (which I'm sure now was St Louis):\n\nhttp://www.asias.faa.gov/pls/apex/f?p=100:18:2725792248864::NO::AP_BRIEF_RPT_VAR:19970201002639I\n\nEdit again: It sounds way more serious in all caps and I now see the word \"fire\". Don't remember him telling us that but it would explain 87 fire trucks out there.  \n\nNARRATIVE: ON CLIMB, AT 1000', #1 ENG FIRE LIGHT ILLUMINATED AND FIRE BELL OCCURRED ALL ENG INDICATIONS WERE NORMAL AND APPROX EQUAL.

    "body": "The following is reposted from an earlier thread, but it's even more relevant here.\n\nA former co-worker, Jason, told me this story.  Jason was working at a dock in China that looked something like [this](https://ak3.picdn.net/shutterstock/videos/12385283/thumb/1.jpg), and unloaded shipping containers from huge international cargo ships.  A typhoon had just passed, and many of the inbound ships had been delayed for days due to the extreme weather.  Once the weather cleared, there was a backlog of ships waiting to be docked and unloaded.  To make matters worse, a tropical depression had just been upgraded to a tropical storm, and was expected to make landfall within 48 hours.\n\nIt was organized chaos as the dock workers frantically tried to unload three times the volume of shipping containers in half the time.  Jason was a Senior Cargo Agent, and his job was to verify that the information on the offloaded shipping containers matched the information on the manifest, and to visually inspect shipping containers for damage.  A cargo agent had to sign off on all cargo before an unloaded ship could disembark.  As there were a limited number of spaces for ships to dock, it was crucial that the cargo agents verify the unloaded shipments as quickly as possible so that another ship could dock immediately.  \n\nEveryone at the dock had walkie talkieies (hand-held portable two-way radios), and Jason heard Dock Manager 1 going absolutely apeshit because an unloaded ship had been waiting in the dock for nearly two hours, and no cargo agent had verified their delivery.  Jason radioed Cargo Agent 1 assigned to that area, but there was no answer.  He then radioed Cargo Agent 2, and still received no response.  He then radioed the next closest Senior Cargo Agent 1 and asked him to drop everything and verify the cargo immediately.\n\nAfter thirty minutes, Dock Manager 2 radioed that the ship was STILL docked.  Jason then radioed Senior Cargo Agent 1 who he had sent over there, and did not receive a response.  He then radioed Dock Manager 1 who had been screaming into the radio, and again received no response.  Jason was now the only Senior Cargo Agent in the area, and it now fell to him to verify the unloaded shipment and get the delayed ship out of port ASAP.  As he got into his truck to drive over, a nagging feeling of dread kept telling him not to go.  He ignored the feeling and drove there anyway, all the while trying and failing to radio anyone else in the area.  When he arrived at the unloading zone, he couldn't bring himself to get out of the truck, and later said that it felt as if he was being physically pushed back into his seat.  \n\nJason then picked up his radio with a shaking hand and broadcast, \"Unknown threat near unloading section four.  All workers evacuate immediately.  This is not a drill.\"  And just like that, a multi-billion dollar port was shut down.  \n\nA HazMat team was soon dispatched, and found that a shipping container damaged in transit had been carrying heavier than air inert gas.  The gas leaked and displaced the air, then became trapped between several rows of closely stacked shipping containers.  Every person that approached immediately lost consciousness.  Five people were found dead near the damaged container, and Jason was later fired because he did not actually have the authority to shut down the port.  \n\nJason filed the Chinese equivalent of a wrongful termination lawsuit, but was strongly encouraged to settle, or else the Chinese government might find him partially responsible for the workers' deaths.  As a white foreigner in China, this was a very real possibility, and he ended up settling for a modest amount.  Jason still blames himself for the death of Senior Cargo Agent 1, and gave the settlement amount to the man's widow.",

Along with his gun hobby, he was an amateur pornographic photographer. After buying the shotguns we wanted to go to a range to shoot them and this guy actually knew of a public range and asked if we wanted to go shooting. My dad, brother, and I loaded up in the truck to go pick this guy up from his house. On the way my dad warned us that he was alittle \"strange\". We got to his house and went inside. There were cardboard boxes stacked damn near to the ceiling everywhere in his small town home. His wife was crying and he was yelling at her to shut her mouth. I'm assuming she was upset that he was leaving to go shoot guns when he had a horrible mess at home and a newborn baby. We jumped in the vehicle and headed out towards the range. He was talking a mile a minute about guns. Popping strange pills along the way. My brother and I looked at each other and just laughed as he would go on about the weirdest shit. We spent a couple hours at the range and headed home for the day. We just knew that there was something seriously wrong with this guy and decided not to go shooting with him, or even deal with this guy ever again. A few months later i was on the school library computer and I noticed a familiar face on the news homepage.

When the pain moved to my side, I knew something was wrong, so I called the doctor, who called me in for an emergency appointment - I was worried it might be appendicitis, he agreed.\n\nI got there, got prodded and poked and told there was nothing wrong with me - 'if it was really your appendix, you wouldn't be able to sit there and talk to me.'. Fair enough, so I went home.\n\nLater that night, I start throwing up, so I knew something was wrong, so off to the hospital. The complete bitch of a doctor prodded and poked around again and declared it was just a stomach bug, or maybe a urine infection. Told me to drink some flat coke(!) and go to the doctor in the morning (bear in mind, I'm so pale as to be actually grey by this point and can barely hold down any more than a couple of sips of water).\n\nLater in the morning, I'm still not feeling right so I get my SO to take me to the doctor again. More of the usual prodding and a 'well it's probably an infection, but I'm going to refer you to the hospital, just in case.'\n\nSo I get to the hospital - long story short, I have a whole bunch of tests, but they're still not convinced it was appendicitis. I was, by this point. They eventually agree to do an appendectomy, using keyhole surgery.\n\nSo I go down for the op, which they reckon will take an hour or so 'and don't be surprised if you still have an appendix when you wake up, we're going to have a look first'.\nI woke up about six hours later with a 4 inch incision on my side with a tube sticking out of it rather than the three small holes I'd been told to expect. I asked the nurse what the hell happened, and got 'oh yes, your appendix was really bad, apparently. I think it burst as they were removing it.'\n\nSo yeah; not only did I have appendicitis like I thought, but I had it really bad. I ended up in the hospital for another week being treated for sepsis.\n\n**TL;DR - Medical experts thought I had a UTI or something; I was convinced my appendix was about to blow.

We literally hit every store in that mall and I couldn't land on one to buy him. Hours spent and nothing.\n\nIt was about a 45 min drive home and my gf is frustrated with me. Why couldn't I pick one? What was going on? I pulled the car over and started crying. I couldn't explain it. I told her I don't know why I'm crying and I don't know why I can't pick a watch but I don't think he's going to be around long enough to use it. Why buy a watch if he doesn't have much time left?\n\nEnded up finding one and we had a great Christmas. \n\nIn the last week of March, 3 months later, he got sick.  Turned out to be a MRSA infection and he passed away March 31st. I walked into his hospital room after the Drs failed to revive him, to say goodbye. The  watch was on the window sill and I grabbed it as I walked out and in the hall I remembered the premonition. \n\n",

    "body": "I used to own a cat. It was a stray that came to us for food and affection. We've had multiple strays like this but this one was different. A year after she first came to us, she got hit by a car. We found her and took her inside, which we didn't allow first. She recovered and you could tell she was so gratefull. We had her for another 4-5 years until last year.\n\nAbout a year ago I woke up from a sound outside my window. There is a big farm a bit further up the street so it's not unusual for trucks to drive by in the middle of the night, but that day I had the feeling that this sound wasn't a truck. I couldn't sleep for the rest of the night because of this feeling and the first thing I did the morning after was look outside if I saw something. There was nothing, but all day long I was stuck with this feeling something was not right. \n\nWhen my dad came home that evening I asked him if he saw the cat, he did not. About an hour after he called me and said these exact words, \"I think we have a problem\". That moment I knew ... He found the cat in behind our house hiding for the rain under a metal plate. It couldn't walk anymore but it still lived. My dad took her to the vet and left it there so they could take some pictures and do some tests. Only 20 minutes after he came home they called already. It appeared her spine got cut in two and the bottom part of her body got totally fkd up. There was nothing they could do... \n\nMy dad told me there was nothing I could have done. But only if I had searched better that morning, that it shouldn't have spent that whole day alone in the rain. I feel so guilty for that ... I always tell myself i'm a dogperson, but damn I loved that cat.\n\nI haven't really told this to anyone since it happened and it feels good to finally share this. And now the obligatory 'english is not my first language so be gentle' \n\n\n",

No one knew what he looked like yet but he had already killed 3 people at this point. Well, my granny has lived alone since my pawpaw passed about 15 years ago. She lives at the end of a long dirt road with about 10 other families but the closest one was about a 1/4 mile up the road. One afternoon some random guy comes knocking on the front door of her house. My granny is a practical woman, she has never been to school because she grew up on a farm and was expectef to pull her weight, but she is a smart woman. She goes to the door but doesn't open it (glass door). The 40ish year old man is there asking if he can use the phone since his car broke down, granny doesn't like the look of this guy. If he doesn't live here there is no reason for him to be on this road and if he was visiting someone their house or anyone else's house would have been closer since she lives on a dead end. Anyways, she tells him that no he can't use the phone and needs to leave. She backs up and picks up my pawpaw's 410 as she goes. Once he sees the shotgun he hightails it out of there. About a week later the cops finally catch the serial killer and low and behold if it isn't the same damn man.\n\nhttp://www.thestate.com/news/local/article14344643.html\n",

I noticed that the nose of the airplane seemed to be higher up than usual while we were sitting on the ground.\n\nI told my first officer about it and he agreed. We double checked the weight and balance and everything seemed to be right.\n\nI decided to just taxi out towards the runway and see if the wheel struts would go back to their normal positions during taxi. They didn't. Still felt weird to me. Something wasn't right.\n\nI told ground control we needed to go back to the gate. Called ops and told them we're headed back because I think something isn't right with the weight and balance.\n\nAfter we get back, I ask them to check how much ballast we have in the aircraft. It's verified on my sheet as 500lb, but I have a feeling...\n\nTurns out, yep, they forgot to put it in the plane. So had we taken off, the center of gravity would have been out of whack - waaay past limits. It could have resulted in an airplane that was impossible to control. Just like that [747 that took off and had the load slide to the back.](https://youtu.be/lksDISvCmNI)\n\nThat was a day that I was really pleased that I had so much experience flying to give me that feeling & that feeling could very well have saved my life along with others. \n\nEdit: A lot of people are asking how 500lb could be an issue on a large aircraft. Not all airliners are that big. The incident I'm talking about in particular was on equipment with less than 40 passenger seats. \n\nEdit 2: Evidently that 747 crash was due to the load shifting and breaking the elevator control mechanism (not the actual load shift itself as I previously thought.) \n\nEdit 3: [Here is a link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1JxDQVU_j8) to a good weight and balance lesson for small aircraft that explains why aircraft need to be within the weight and balance limits. It might also help some understand why 500lb can make a big difference when it is placed in a particular spot on an aircraft. ",

So she sets up an appointment and...turns out I had slightly broken a vertebrae. Tiny cracks on each side of the same vertebrae. Safe to say I don't take her advice much anymore\n\n\nEdit: Thank you everyone for your replies. I'll try my best to read all of your stories as well\n\n\nEdit 2: Now I know why they always say rip my inbox\n",

Most of these episodes happened in college and I would see roommates come and go, sit at their desks, climb in and out of their bunks, etc but I never knew for sure if what was going on in my \"dream\" was actually happening or not.\n\nFastforward to my mid-20's and I'm having one of these dreams. I'm laying in bed in my apartment that I shared with my girlfriend. This time I am visualizing her coming home (she worked late nights) much later than she usually would, see me and immediately break down in regret of \"why the hell did I just do that?\"\n\nI knew what she was regretting. She had cheated on me. Again.\n\nSo moving on to later that day, it's all I can think about, and even though my \"dream\" hadn't actually happened, I just knew that she cheated on me regardless.

    "body": "I was sitting on the bus when I had the feeling that someone was watching me. I casually look up and scan around and sure enough catch some fucking guy staring at me. Great. But it gets worse, all of a sudden I realize the guy next to me - the guy who is between me and the aisle of the bus - has been staring at me too. I'm starting to get panicky because I'm all alone, and two creeps at once is too many to keep track of.\n\nLuckily it's only about 9 PM and I'm in a very busy part of town, I just need to get off the bus in a well-lit area. I just want to stand up and stand near the exit of the bus by the driver until my stop arrives. Unfortunately, that means I need to pass by the creep in the aisle seat. As I stand up, he makes no motion to adjust for my exit. Sure enough, he's not going to get up, he's not even going to swivel around. I know I'm going to have to squeeze my way past him and I know he's going to squeeze my ass when I do. And I squeeze past him. And he squeezes my ass. Now I'm creeped out, humiliated and angry. I'm trying to keep it together and get off the bus as soon as possible. Unfortunately, in my emotional rush, I get off the bus one stop too early. I can just see the busy, well-lit streets one long block away, but I've gotten off the bus in a dark, empty stretch of sidewalk - and so, to my horror, has the other creepy man on the bus who watched me the entire time. \n\nAt this point every alarm bell in my mind is blaring and I'm desperate to make it to the right, well-lit street. It's only the one block but I can feel his every step next to mine. It doesn't take long for him to make the first move, trying to start a conversation but I only walk faster and ignore what he's saying. Then he starts to talk again and WHAM! He shoulders me hard, in the direction of a dark alley I hadn't seen in the shadows. He starts whispering things and to this day I don't remember what he was whispering because I'm screaming and screaming for help, but there's no one around on this block. He starts dragging me into the alley and at this point I did something I'd never don't before in my life, and I gathered up all of my strength and punched him as hard as I possibly could right in his face. I was wearing rings and I think this is why it worked since my upper body strength isn't much to speak of against a full grown man. It was enough to get him to release me and I sprinted, faster than I ever have in my whole life, screaming the whole time for help until I made it to that busy, well-lit street. People were staring at me because I was still screaming and sobbing, but I kept going until I made it home. \n\nIn some ways what I remember most was the reaction when I got home. All my male housemates were stunned to hear what happened but their girlfriends all started talking to me about similar assaults they'd each faced, which only stunned my housemates further. This certainly wasn't my first street harassment but it was the most serious. The rest of the house was going out to a party and the last thing I wanted was to be left alone, brooding and scaring myself, but that night I was pretty quiet and all my housemates kept a close watch on me to make sure I was okay.

    "body": "Many, many years ago, for a few days, I needed to walk my mother's dogs  in the evening.  I'd drive to her place, get the dogs, go for a long walk, feed them, go home.  One day, a Wednesday, they were extremely \"pully\" on the walk, and it seemed like something went \"wrong\" inside me.  Went home (I was living with my Dad and sister at the time), and said \"I think something's gone wrong, I may have pulled a muscle in my stomach, or something\".\n\nNext day, I felt worse and started vomiting.  Again, I expressed how I thought something was very wrong, but my sister (who works in a hospital) just said it was a vomiting bug.  I just started feeling worse, and worse, vomiting more, and didn't sleep that night (Thursday).\n\nI awoke Friday, my Dad was golfing, and my sister was at work.  I vomited once or twice, and then thought about curling up and dying.  But no, I thought I'll try not die for a bit longer, so decided to pop out to the local GP centre, which was about a 10 minute walk from my house.  It took me just over an hour, and I thought about curling up and dying about 3 times along the way.  Went into the surgery, took a number, and waited about 40 minutes to be seen.\n\nDoctor saw me, saw that I was ready to faint / vomit / die, and queried why I didn't make a big deal to be seen sooner.  I said something along the lines of \"dunno\".  She poked around me, gave me painkillers, said it seems like appendicitis, but it couldn't be that because I'd be in much more pain.  But, she did call an ambulance to bring me to A&E.  In the ambulance, they poked me, gave me some painkillers, and said it couldn't be appendicitis, because I'm not in enough pain.  I get into A&E, the poke me, say it can't be appendicitis.  Some more people see me, poke me, say it can't be appendicitis.  About 8 o'clock, a doctor sees me, and does the same.  *But* he does think I should be X-Rayed to see what *is* wrong with me.\n\nAbout 10 minutes after my X-Ray, he comes rushing out, and says I'm booked in for surgery in 10 minutes, telling me my appendix was just about fit to explode.  They took the evil bastard out, I was in recovery for a week, lost about 2 stone in weight, and wasn't really myself for a few months.\n\nThe dogs did it man, those fucking dogs did it.  But I will *never* forget all the medical dudes telling me \"I would be in more pain\".  I responded to each one of them \"I'm in severe pain here, it really hurts, like 9 or 10 out of 10 pain\", and each one came back \"Nah, you'd be screaming if it was your appendix\".",

I immediately knew what was about to go down so my survival instincts kicked in and I said something along the lines of \"haha, that's funny I'm not falling for your tricks\" and high tailed it out of that kitchen and waited for my mom and aunt to come back, outside the house.

One evening my father took me to one side and and asked how I'd feel about him asking her to marry him. I got an awful feeling in the pit of my stomach and felt nauseated. I told my father I didn't want him to and he asked why as he thought I liked her. I explained that he did like her but had a bad feeling and he said \"that's just a feeling, they don't mean anything\". He already had the ring and proposed straight away. I got really excited about the engagement), the wedding, moving house, and my impending little sister. \n\nAfter the wedding she changed. After my half-sister was born she went batshit. She abused myself, my full sister (my mother's child), and later my half sister  (her own child). He only left her when my doctor told him something was clearly going on with her that was affecting my health (she was putting a substance that I'm intolerant to in my food and my father wouldn't believe me and would force me to eat whatever she made however I couldn't get a doctor alone without her to tell them) and my maternal grandmother told him if he didn't leave her she'd go for custody that he finally left her. He accused me of lying for the entire time leading up to that and has never asked me about any of my attempts to get help since.\n\nEDIT: I've gotten to the point of not knowing if my replies are disappearing or it's the same question being asked by a different person. Tomorrow's the last anniversary of my mother's death before I hit the age she was when she died and I have plans with a friend this evening because I've been dreading tomorrow, my next birthday, the day I hit her age in days, and Halloween 2018 for ages.\n\nFAQs:\n\nI was 8 when my mother died, 10 when they married, 12 when we left. Sister was 3 when our mother died.\n\nOur mother died of an aneurysm, survived the first one but had a second in hospital.\n\nHalf sister is at university studying medicine. Social services were involved at points and made things worse. I waited until she was 18 to get counselling to avoid her going through that again. The access case was an issue and stepm told toddler half-s if she spent the night at ours stepm would die so she eventually stopped coming at all. Stepm accused me of abusing half-s in the access case (I was terrified of going near that baby. Shortest example: I smiled, stepm freaked out that I have an evil smile, picked up half-s and fled from the room). I don't know if half-s would welcome an attempt to start a relationship.\n\nStepm married again, beyond reproductive age, no idea if he already had kids.\n\nI gave my father a letter 9 years ago saying I'd have nothing to do with him until he put it in writing that he'd never use violence or threats of violence against me again. Still waiting.\n\nAbusers can be very charming. They wouldn't get anyone in a position to abuse them otherwise. They can be very capable of putting up a facade for people like social services, teachers, co-workers.\n\nI would agree my father's a cunt but he lacks the depth, warmth, and capacity.\n\nEDIT 2: oh and it's citric acid. The intolerance runs on my mother's side but my sister didn't get it so it was safe for everyone else. I can smell if an orange has been opened in a room within a couple of hours and taste orange, pineapple, and lemon juice in smaller quantities than normal people. I was diagnosed before I can remember. Apparently 100ml of orange squash took me out for weeks. My father may not have been aware it was in some things but he knew it was in at least one thing she regularly served as it had chunks of oranges that he told me to eat around (even though the whole thing was clearly marinaded in orange juice). \n\nEDIT 3: my gran took us camping annually. We never left in a hurry. No campers I know of disappeared. \n\nEDIT 4: *removes helmet* I am no man",

    "body": "Tonight! Literally just now. I just sat down to relax after averting the crisis. That crisis being the untimely, albeit peaceful and painless, death of my whole family.\n\nWe need some backstory first.\n\nLast weekend there were heavy rains in my area. A previously small leak made itself know to be much more substantial, and could no longer be ignored. Being of a low income persuasion as we are, we can't afford to hire professionals for this kind of thing (it's only a last resort). But I'm pretty comfortable and confident tackling problems myself, so up to the roof I go. After some examining, failed attempts, and debating, we determine that the best course of action is to wrap our chimney in a tarp and call it a weekend. Keep in mind its pouring rain, and I've been on the roof for hours a day for 3 days.\n\nNow, this chimney isn't used for a fireplace, but rather it is the vent for our oil furnace (it's a very old house). If that vent were to be blocked, the exhaust from the furnace could back up into the house, replacing all the oxygen with carbon monoxide. Warm, cozy, non-life-sustaining, carbon monoxide.\n\nWe knew this going in, and specifically took precautions to avoid capping the vent, while still effectively waterproofing the chimney. We also discused scenarios where the vent is blocked; how we would know, what we would do, etc. Satisfied that we are safe, we go about our lives, happy and dry.\n\nFast forward a few days to last night. I can't sleep, so I'm up watching YouTube and browsing reddit all night. Then I start feeling a little off. Nothing serious, nothing I would normally worry about, just a mild headache, maybe a bit woozy. I brush it off and continue watching. A few hours later I'm ready for bed, but I couldn't shake that uneasy feeling. At this point I'm not even considering carbon monoxide poisoning, I'm just tired and hungry, that's all. So I decide to go downstairs and have a snack before I sleep. This decision quite possibly saved the lives of everyone in the house. To think I almost didn't go... \n\nWhen I get downstairs I notice an odd smell. As you might have guessed by now, furnace exhaust. It was familiar because I had gotten a face full of it while standing over the chimney. Immediately I know what the problem is, and I rush to open windows and turn off the heater. I need to vent the house, and get fresh oxygen in. Then I realize that if I was feeling woozy upstairs, the problem is probably even worse downstairs. Meaning my sleeping family might be in worse condition. I check everyone, and they are sleeping soundly. Phew. \n\nBut the problem remains - the vent is blocked and the house is full of death gas. I can't leave the windows open all morning with the heater off, because everyone will freeze. It's still dark outside, so I'm not keen on the idea of going onto the roof by myself to fix the problem. So I have to wake everyone up to ensure we are all safe, and so we can talk about what to do.\n\nIn the end we dicide the best thing to do is wait till sunrise, then go up to fix the problem. Which is exactly what we did. My mother and I go up there and pull the tarp back off the opening, ensuring it can't be blocked again. It's definitely less waterproof, but it's also death proof.\n\nSo here I am now. After staying up nearly 24 hours, climbing a ladder onto my roof in the morning sun, and saving my families lives. All because I felt a little iffy before going to bed. ",

As we are approaching my truck to get in, we heard a couple girls screaming bloody murder, so we ran over to the guardrail to see what was going on. The lack of light in the lot hindered us a bit, but we see a group of about five or six people running away from what looked to be the guy who approached us. \n\nTurns out the guy shit himself and threw it all over two of the girls in the group. \n\n\nEdit: typos",

    "body": "This is hyper weird but as a kid (and much less frequently now as an adult) I had severe deja vu but not in the traditional sense. It was almost like months or years before the event, I would have a dream and then after the event or during the event, I would remember the dream I had that was actually about the event that was unfolding.\n\nThe best example was when my brother got third degree burns over his body and had to get flown to the Sydney children\u2019s hospital. Camping at wyangla dam in our caravan we were playing Pictionary. My brother was smashing it and his last attempt was stumping us all. The answer was the tv show neighbours and as soon as the answer came out I remembered a dream where the Pictionary answer was neighbors but couldn\u2019t remember what happened afterward except that something really bad was about to happen. \n\nIt was weird because the feeling was so heavy and then 5 minutes later the jug falls and the rest is history. I remembered neighbours so vividly from this dream like memory but knew something bad was going to happen because I remembered the feeling of dread associated after. Other examples were when I knew my grandad had passed away as I had a dream about my mum crying and walking through our front gates and when I actually saw her crying and coming home- I just knew- the dream came true.\n\nThe way my young mind rationalized this was that we are living a memory that happens before the event. We have experienced this already but life has like a delay similar to radio. Sounds stupid but it\u2019s what I\u2019ve got.\n\nEdit: the burns were from boiling water from a jug- fire isn\u2019t the only way to receive burns (boiling water is one of the worst according to the nurses). \nI also need to point this out. Lots of non believers have called this out as bullshit or simply deja vu. I am a man of science and yet I can admit that this seems illogical but that is why I explained through example. It feels more than deja vu and it involves realizing that you had this \u2018future memory\u2019 and thinking that this or that will happen before it happens based off the memory.",

    "body": "I was an 18 year old kid working in fast food. I usually worked nights as I was taking college classes. My friend who was still in high school also worked that night. She was on register, I was packing orders. It's just before closing, the restaurant is empty except for the manager near the back, a guy doing dishes, and my friend and I at the front. \n\nThis guy comes in and orders a simple box to go. No big deal, we didn't need to cook anything. I have the meal all packed up before the guy's even done paying, so I turn around to hand it to him. He's speaking to my friend. She apparently gave him the wrong change, she just corrected it and gave him the right bills, then: \"oh your hands are so soft, do you moisturize\". I don't like to stereotype, but this guy looks like he doesn't give a flying fuck about moisturizing skin regimens. Alarm bells are instantly going off in my head. Then he shows her the bills in his hands, she gave him the wrong change again! And she can't argue, those are the bills she just handed him, right there in his hands. So she mutters an apology and goes to hand him the correct bills... again. \n\nAround this time my mom was a manager at Walmart and told stories about this kind of thing all the time. I go in the back to get my GM who, of course, was making a personal phone call. \"B, we got a quick change artist!\" Blank look. \"What?\" \"A quick change artist, B! We got a flim-flammer!\" Now he gets it. He hangs up and quickly walks up to the front with me just behind him. We get there right as my friend is giving this guy change for a $100 (which we are not supposed to do) and guess what? She gave him the wrong change again! Instead of 5 $20's, she gave him a $20 and 4 $1's, as she could clearly see when he showed her the bills in his hands. All of these transactions took place in between the man's smooth chit chat. \"Did you have a good weekend? Oh look, you gave me ones instead of twenties. It's okay, it happens! It's probably been a long night for you girls...\" There was nothing the manager or I could do at this point. Ideally when this happens, the cashier is supposed to close the drawer, apologize saying and say it was all their fault, and get a manager to count the drawer (not that we ever got any training on this, I just happen to know because of my mom). This was so blatant though... plus there's the risk that the guy might just pull out a gun. So the guy sees us and knows we're onto him, so he shuts up, I chuck his chicken across the counter to him and he leaves. The manager locks the door and counts the register... my friend was short $220. The guy wasn't that smooth, my friend was a combination of dumb teenager and slightly high. We watched the tapes after- the guy had it all prepared. We watched my friend hand him back the correct change, which he would slide into his back pocket, move his hand around to his front pocket and bring out a twenty and a few ones, then show it to her like it was the cash she had just handed him. The worst part was the restaurant made her pay it all back. This, kids, is why you are required to count a customer's change out to them instead of just handing it to them. \n\nEdited the bills, for math reasons.\n\nTL;DR: My friend got taken for $220 by a flim-flammer.

At the time, I just wrote it off as my ADHD pulling one of a hundred tv/movie quotes about it being \u201cquiet...too quiet\u201d but the feeling persisted. \n\nI went into the choir room (where I always hung out before school) and greeted one of my friends and my life-long teacher friend. She must\u2019ve sensed my uneasiness because she asked me what was wrong. I told her \u201cI don\u2019t know, something just doesn\u2019t FEEL right.\u201d Sure enough, literally 2 seconds after I finished that sentence, the tornado sirens in the building went off and we all had to file into the costume storage area under the stage. \n\nTurns out a storm cell had moved in at record speed and created a perfect tornado. When we were allowed to go outside about 2 hours later (there was still a lightning threat), two of the largest trees on campus had branches torn off, multiple cars had damage from said branches, and a bus had tipped over. \n\nNothing terribly dangerous as everybody was brought inside in time, but it is still one of the weirdest sequence of events I\u2019ve experienced.

Two separate occasions I've been hiking, one was in the Appalachian mountains, was up front with few friends where I just froze, no warning signs, or sounds, I just stopped, got a crippling drop in my stomach and told everyone STOP in as high volume of a whisper as I could. Everything goes silent. A friend tries to say \"what?\" And I put my hand over his mouth and about 30 yards ahead was a black bear and a cub crossing the trail. Black bears are no grizzlys, but you still don't want to startle them. So we just waited to pass.\n\nThe second occasion wasnt in blue ridge but with the same crew. They brought up that story and we all laughed. The next day we're getting ready to make camp, and I had this terrifying feeling there was someone in the woods watching us (human). I freaked out a bit, friends told me to brush it off, we were too far out, the likeliness of seeing other hikers was slim. It's been about 20 minutes and I still can't shake that feeling, so I just straight up told them \"hey I'm not camping here tonight, y'all can stay or come with, but I'm moving up to the shelter\" That was a little ways off. I pack up my shit, one my friends says he will come with and leave the other two will stay. I literally set ONE foot out of sight of the camp and I heard that terrifying howl/scream that was posted on Reddit a few weeks ago of a mountain lion/cougar. I've never had the hair on my neck stand up so straight. The worst part was having to walk back TOWARD  the sound and wait in the camp for them to hastily pack up their shit because we all needed to move together. I never saw it, but it was so loud it HAD to have been less than 50 yards out. I didn't sleep a single second or walk farther than the fire to take a piss that night. \n",

It's kind of hard to describe but I live next to a 24 hour grocery store that's by itself in a big parking lot that I walk up a side alley and turn to the left to get to the front entrance.\n\nOne night at 5am I walked over to it to get something. When I came back out of the store there was an old man waiting at a bus stop right out front next to the alley I had come from. For some reason I immediately felt weird and did not want to walk by him, at all. So I walked back into the grocery store. I waited ten minutes before I decided to walk back anyway, thinking I was being silly. The man was gone. \n\nBUT I still felt really weird. That's when I remembered that the bus doesn't run for two hours. And since he never went into the grocery store I couldn't think of a single reason why he would have been waiting there. I just kept thinking, he was waiting for me and even though he was gone I KNEW I could not walk back the way I came. Instead I walked in the opposite direction and up a hill before crossing over. When I looked down I could see in the alley I would have walked down, the man was hiding there, leaning against the wall, waiting for me. \nI now only go to that store during daylight. ",

He'd always drop those comments but absolutely never tried anything, in fact I now really identify with his nerdiness that was totally rare in our tiny town.\n\nIN college my mom told me he had disappeared, and that his wife figured he drown while swimming, but they never found him. I figured immediately that it was a suicide, having spent more time with different people and realizing that the guy was probably in the closet. Years later I got a note from my mom saying that someone's dog ran into the back door happily gnawing on a human jawbone. The police showed up and scoured the area, eventually finding the guy's body. Turned out he had gone off into the woods with a shotgun, and did himself in. I haven't talked to anyone about this, but I have a feeling I know the reason.",

I had an uneasy feeling and decided to go to my dorm to pick up some papers I'd need later first, figured the feeling was just the 'I need these papers' thought in my head. \n\n\nI got to my dorm lobby and saw a friend sitting there, so we chat for a little bit. He says \"Yeah I'm supposed to be in class right now, but I dunno. Just had a feeling I didn't want to be there today.\" It was his first time skipping a class in college apparently, so he had some honor-student-guilt about not going. \n\n\nNot 10 minutes into our chat another friend comes running into the lobby - there had been a shooting in a classroom in the building that is next to my department's building. So had I not stopped at my dorm, I would have been crossing in front of the building right around the shooting time. Days (? weeks maybe) later when the media showed the path the gunman took on campus, I saw I may have crossed paths with him had I gone straight on to my department like I'd planned. We turn on the TV for news and try to stay calm as everything goes on lockdown but I'm high key freaking out.  \n\n\nAnother student comes in and tells us what class the shooting happened in...it was my friend's class that he skipped that day for the first time. Not only that, but my friend was a big dude with not great eyesight, so he usually sat in the front row to avoid climbing all the stairs and see the board better. Most of the people who died were in the front rows. \n\n\nGrateful for both of us listening to our guts that day.",

Never told him what happened or anyone else for that matter. \n\nA boy around my age had been abducted within the same year in a decently high profile case (made the national news) My mom had made me watch the newscast with her about how the boy had been abducted after little league and told me to *never* talk to a stranger.

    "body": "This was about 15 years ago. My parents went out for a nice dinner for their anniversary and decided that I was old enough and responsible enough to be left alone for a few hours on a weeknight. I was almost 9 and we owned a fairly protective dog at the time so it all seemed fine. \n\nThey leave, tell me to lock up and to call if anything happens. I do so and proceed to party around the house like a rockstar, cause dude I had the WHOLE dang house myself and I could do whatever I wanted, HELL to the YEAH!\n\nHalfway through a Sailor Moon marathon, I get a knock on the door. I'm confused as all get out cause it's only been about two hours and they said they probably wouldn't be back till around 10 anyway. I guess mama has left something she needed AGAIN and swung by to grab it.\n\nMy front door is a system of two doors, a super old, thick wooden door (the house was originally built in the 30's and this door is still the original piece) and then outside of that (at the time) a screen door. My dog is raising hell at the front door, but I just pull her back to calm down, cause she had a tendency to be reactive to most noises. \n\nWelp, it's not my mom at the door, some middle-aged man I've never met before in my life. Puppo is now basically feral so I keep the screen door firmly closed and a hand on her collar as I ask the many what he wants. He starts in on this weird convoluted story about how he has two young twin daughters and how they got into a fight and that one of them ran away.\n\nNow this man then claims that he believes his daughter is hiding in my house and would like to come look for her. I tell him no such girl is here and why does he think she would be here in the first place. He goes on into a long story about how this was the house they first lived in and how it's the one she was born in, and how it was like a safe place for her and would be the most likely place she would run away to as it was really the only other place she knows.\n\nSo I felt kinda weird since I opened the door and this dudes story hasn't been helping his cause, but now I KNOW something shitty is going down. I, in no uncertain terms, inform the guy that he must have the wrong house because THIS house was built and has been lived in by my family since it's construction. My dad was born in that house and after my mom and dad told his parents that they pregnant with my older sister they gave it to them as a present to begin their family. He must be mistaken cause I know all this to be fact. Hell, there were pictures less than 10ft away from me on the wall of my dad and uncle playing in the front yard in the late 70s.\n\nBy now my dog is growling like crazy and dude is getting kinda agitated. He insists that I don't know what I'm talking about and that if I would just give him a few minutes to search for his daughter he could be on his way.\n\nThe latch on the screen door was broken and I was putting all my strength at the time in holding my dog from the door. He opens the screen door with one hand and with the other reaches for my closest arm.\n\nMy crazy cocker goes fucking ballistic! Uses all her strength to lunge at him, gets a hold of his hand, and bites down. Now man is yelling and confused. He pushes back against the screen door and slams it shut to get my dog off of him. Sadie gets pushed back indoors but is still raging. I quickly slam the front door, lock it, and chain it shut. Run around the house and make sure all other doors and windows are locked and then hunker down in the bathroom hyperventilating and wait about 15 min till Sadie's growling has calmed some. Check outside, no man or his car. Both long gone.\n\nI call my parents and tell them they need to come home RIGHT NOW PLEASE. When they get home I recount the whole story. Dad goes the check the front door and sure enough on the screen door jam and siding of the house is a large smear of blood.\n\nSadie was treated like a queen and got a whole steak for her to eat on that weekend.\n\n\nedit* - Someone asked what Sadie looked like and I said I would try and find pics, which I did!\n\nhttps://imgur.com/HQX6cnF\n\nhttps://imgur.com/8OBB6KX\n\nhttps://imgur.com/V1v7jOF\n\nAnd I agree she was small and she was adorable, but that doesn't undermine her warrior spirit. I really liked the Mark Twain quote one of you commented :\n\n\"It's not the size of the dog in the fight, it's the size of the fight in the dog.\"",

    "body": " A year ago my elder Uncle did not show up for work. He's older, unreliable type, and I assumed he got drunk and forgot. Something in my gut said to just go check on him. I arrived at his apartment building and the staff refused to let me inside. I was a bit frustrated, but they went upstairs and knocked on his door... No answer. They told me he was not home and I was not allowed to go inside. \n\nI then became pissed off but assumed i couldn't do anything but call the cops. How could I bother police to do a wellness check. He probably got drunk somewhere else and was sleeping at a friend's house. Instead of letting that thought deter me from checking on his well being I decided to search the area for his vehicle. \n\nI searched all the parking lots in the area. 3 different parking lots, each one with 4-5 floors of cars. No sign of his vehicle anywhere! I was still not giving up. I walked all the streets around his building to check for his vehicle. Finally, I found his car parked blocks away from the building. I ran back to the apartment building as quick as possible and demanded they opened the door, because his car was near the building. I wasn't leaving until the management or the police opened the door. \n\nI dragged the maintenance person, property manager, social worker upstairs to his apartment and began banging on the door again, no answer. They all shrugged and I again demanded they open the door. As the maintenance man put the key in the lock, my uncle opens up in his tighty-whitetys. Jesus Christ, everyone was pissed at me because they thought I was overreacting to a gut feeling.\n\nThey all storm off pissed. I walk inside and began talking with him about missing work. He sounds groggy like he just woke up. He keeps mumbling and then discovers he can not speak properly. We are going back and forth for 5 minutes and I tell him if he can't pronounce his words properly he should go see a doctor immediately.\n\nHe is hesitant but finally agrees. We walk downstairs, stroll to his car, and head to the hospital. As soon as we walk in the door of the hospital they rush him in the back. Within second we are surrounded by neurologists, er doctors, and nurses plugging him into every machine possible. He suffered a severe stroke. My diligence might have saved his life, because he had not awaken since suffering the stroke over 12 hours earlier. ",

It was of course a shitshow with dozens of kids and even a damn trash can of jungle juice (it was clean). Well not even a few beers in and theres flashlights in the backyard and a knock at the door. Before anyone can even try to run there are 4 or 5 cops in the house and they are corralling everyone into the basement. We all knew we were fucked and they said nobody would be arrested but they would be calling parents for anyone who drank. So I basically resigned myself to my fate. The cops said they didn't want to breathalyze anyone and instead would go down the line and ask us if we drank or not and then have us blow at their face to see if we had alcohol on our breath. Each person went down the line and if they hadnt drank the cops would move them to the other room. I was fully expecting to go down and when the cop came to me and asked if I had drank I sheepishly said yes and then blew on his face. He moved on and then he turned to me and asked why I was still standing there. If I didnt want to get in trouble I needed to go to the other room. The look on my friends faces as they saw me inexplicably escape their fate was memorable to say the least. A bunch of my friends got crucified by their parents but I somehow escaped the guillotine. \n\nFun fact. There was actually one kid outside smoking at the time and he saw the cops coming around to the back yard and just bolted into the woods where he sat, in the cold, for hours until he thought it was safe to come out. In reality the cops had only been there maybe an hour. ",

Woke up around 5am because my stomach hurt (I was a high school fast food closer in the summer; 5 am was a nonexistent time for me to be awake). I went downstairs to the living room and sat on the recliner and watched tv, while sipping water. It\u2019s also important to note that earlier the same summer, I was taken to urgent care for dehydration, and the pain felt similar. My mom woke up around 8am and saw me. She asked if I couldn\u2019t sleep and I told her about the pain. Being a nurse, she asked if it felt like before and got me water with a crushed up tums to try to settle my stomach. By 11am, the pain had only gotten worse, so she decided to take me to urgent care again (she was annoyed because she thought I was dehydrated again). Right before we leave house, I throw up clear water and the tums. We get to urgent care and I\u2019m still sipping water while getting checked in. The receptionist told me to stop just in case they needed to do surgery. After I get checked over, asked about the pain, blood drawn and urine test taken, they take me into the emergency bay. The ER doc checks me out while asking, \u201care you sexually active\u201d \u201ccould you be pregnant\u201d \u201care you sure\u201d? Pregnancy test comes back negative and my white blood cell count is high, but I don\u2019t have a fever so it\u2019s probably not my appendix, but it could be a cyst. One regular ultrasound AND a transvaginal ultrasound later, no cyst but still no fever. Well we\u2019ll just admit you for observation just until we figure this out. Finally around 6pm, after 7 hours of tests and waiting, I spike a fever. They call in the surgeon and he pushes on my abdomen three times in three spots, looks at the nurse and asks \u201cwhy wasn\u2019t she to me hours ago?\u201d 7pm I\u2019m in surgery, and I found out later that my appendix was actually starting to leak. 10/10 would not recommend.",

The next day he still wasn't there, she asked management again, saying she was worried and if someone had gone to his house. They brushed her off slightly annoyed by her worry. She got hold of some of his students and asked them if they'd heard from him, they said no, she told them she would go and check on him, one of the kids said \"no, I'll do it\". Kid went there, door was unlocked (this is a safe place), he went around the house and eventually found the guy in the basement lying under a shelf that had fallen on him. He'd been looking putting stuff on the shelves or cleaning and then had a stroke and somehow pulled the shelf down on top of him. Anyway, I don't recall if he was unable to move because of the shelves or the stroke or broken bones or all three, but he survived and recovered however doesn't walk well anymore. I don't remember how long he was there for. \n\n\nThe reason I remember this is that he told my mother how he knew he was boned, that he'd had a stroke and that he somehow needed to keep his mind going and keep awake. So, he started reciting Shakespeare to himself, being a fan he knew a lot of it, so just everything he remembered, from start to end, just to keep the mind going. I found that really amazing. ",

I loved watching him drop trees in the woods, making the backcut, putting in wedges, making adjustments, then once it's going down, time to GTFO. The way you could see the tops of the trees move ever so slightly while they were being cut and beginning to fall was hypnotizing and awesome.\n\nI ran the skidder, and every time a tree got hung up I'd pull it down and drag it away with the rest of them, but those trees that were... not attached to the ground, and just sitting there, resting against other trees, waiting for the slightest breeze to send them crashing down, those ones gave me an uneasy feeling. I was always afraid I'd touch it wrong when I hooked the choker up to it, and I always got away pretty hastily. \n\nMy closest call was probably when I almost rolled the skidder... I wasn't too worried, I dropped the blade to stabilize it, got out, attached the winch to a tree, and pulled myself right. I seemed to give my stepdad a good scare with that one though. He told me about when a guy working for him sunk his bulldozer in a swamp, and stories of other loggers rolling equipment, requiring other equipment being brought in to get things oriented properly.\n\nI do miss working in the woods, it was nice to just wake up, go to work for the day, and come home without having to deal with people, but I don't want to haul chainsaws through the woods and dodge falling trees for the rest of my life.

Unlikely, since she was shot in the top of her head. Either way, I don't think there was enough evidence to convict for murder, so I think he was convicted on a lesser charge.

What that means is that I've survived (so far) and a lot of people I've known and loved did not. I've lost friends, best friends, acquaintances, co-workers, grandparents, mom, relatives, teachers, mentors, students, neighbors, and a host of other folks. I have no children, and I can't imagine the pain it must be to lose a child. But here's my two cents.\n\n>I wish I could say you get used to people dying. I never did. I don't want to. It tears a hole through me whenever somebody I love dies, no matter the circumstances. But I don't want it to \"not matter\". I don't want it to be something that just passes. My scars are a testament to the love and the relationship that I had for and with that person. And if the scar is deep, so was the love. So be it. Scars are a testament to life. Scars are a testament that I can love deeply and live deeply and be cut, or even gouged, and that I can heal and continue to live and continue to love. And the scar tissue is stronger than the original flesh ever was. Scars are a testament to life. Scars are only ugly to people who can't see.\n\n>As for grief, you'll find it comes in waves. When the ship is first wrecked, you're drowning, with wreckage all around you. Everything floating around you reminds you of the beauty and the magnificence of the ship that was, and is no more. And all you can do is float. You find some piece of the wreckage and you hang on for a while. Maybe it's some physical thing. Maybe it's a happy memory or a photograph. Maybe it's a person who is also floating. For a while, all you can do is float. Stay alive.\n\n>In the beginning, the waves are 100 feet tall and crash over you without mercy. They come 10 seconds apart and don't even give you time to catch your breath. All you can do is hang on and float. After a while, maybe weeks, maybe months, you'll find the waves are still 100 feet tall, but they come further apart. When they come, they still crash all over you and wipe you out. But in between, you can breathe, you can function. You never know what's going to trigger the grief. It might be a song, a picture, a street intersection, the smell of a cup of coffee. It can be just about anything...and the wave comes crashing. But in between waves, there is life.\n\n>Somewhere down the line, and it's different for everybody, you find that the waves are only 80 feet tall. Or 50 feet tall. And while they still come, they come further apart. You can see them coming. An anniversary, a birthday, or Christmas, or landing at O'Hare. You can see it coming, for the most part, and prepare yourself. And when it washes over you, you know that somehow you will, again, come out the other side. Soaking wet, sputtering, still hanging on to some tiny piece of the wreckage, but you'll come out.\n\n>Take it from an old guy. The waves never stop coming, and somehow you don't really want them to. But you learn that you'll survive them. And other waves will come. And you'll survive them too. If you're lucky, you'll have lots of scars from lots of loves. And lots of shipwrecks.\n",

Papa didn\u2019t need full care, just someone to be around. \n\nThis was a lie. I soon became a full time unpaid nurse to my grandfather with dementia while working full time and being sick myself, any time I asked for help or tried to make the rest of the family understand what the burden really was they deflected and would say just enough to give me hope before doing nothing. \n\nBut at the same time I love the shit out of my papa, didn\u2019t make it any less of a burden I was totally unprepared for with less than no support. But I truly believed that if I didn\u2019t do it, no one would step up to the plate. So I feel you and your situation so hard. \n\nHowever the important but really hard thing to realize is that she isn\u2019t your responsibility. She\u2019s your parents responsibility and no one is entitled to you taking care of them. It took me a lot of therapy to realize this and I missed out on a lot of my early twenties to a responsibility that wasn\u2019t mine. \n\nEventually I just told my family that I had asked for help multiple times and been refused at every avenue and I was done. I found a new apartment with housemates and told my family I was moving in a month and they had that much time to figure something out. \n\nIt was the hardest thing I\u2019ve ever done, my family claims I betrayed them and my papa, but I know the truth. They betrayed me first and despite all my efforts were incredibly consistent in gaslighting me and refusing to see the problem for what it was. My grandfather needed care, I was completely ill equipped to do so and it was completely inappropriate to make it my responsibility when they simply didn\u2019t want it. \n\nSo I moved. They were pissed and we didn\u2019t speak for a while. And my life is sooooooooooo much better for it. I feel free in a way I didn\u2019t know I could be and guess what? \n\nPapa is doing well. Somehow they figured out how to be responsible without me to lean on. I bet your family will too. \n\nThis was super long but please pm me if you ever want to talk, I\u2019ve been there and it did get better. So much better. It can for you too. \n\n",

She\u2019s a good person, but has struggled with that all her life. Here comes Randy (yes, that\u2019s his actual fucking name), and he constantly validates her and buys her whatever she wants. Which has put him into serious credit card debt because he has no money.  \n\nThe relationship is strained because he is a classic predator who isolates his victim from family and friends. I genuinely don\u2019t know what she ever saw in him. But I think she believes she\u2019s stuck because of the baby. ",

Still, I find it quite unnerving. \n\nedit: IIRC, on the new 787, there's a doc where they show the max flex on the wings. Wow. (don't quote me) But it was something like 35-40 degrees (maybe more).
