    "body": "It was my mother-in-law's birthday, and her daughter and son-in-law had dinner for the event at their place. My wife, three kids, and I drove out after work.\n\nAs we pulled up to their cul-de-sac home in the dark, I saw something odd in the grass between the sidewalk and street near their mailbox. When I got out, an old man (80+ y.o.) called over to me asking if I wouldn't mind helping him up. Said he had been out for a walk, stumbled, and had been in that spot for about 45 minutes.\n\nMy wife and daughters went inside the house, my then 12 y.o. son stayed with me while I helped the man up. Wonderful guy, started saying this was the icing on the cake for his day, as he had fallen asleep early afternoon on his couch with a lit cigarette, which caught the couch on fire. Fire department came, put the fire out with little damage, and moved the couch to the curb when they were done.\n\nBy this time, my brother-in-law had come outside with us. We walked the man back to his house, about 5 doors down. During our trip there, he regaled us with stories of him in the navy during the war, and I'm ashamed to say, I can't remember which war he had said. He made special not to talk to my son about how wonderful it was that he was helping. Introduced himself to us as 'Bill'. Said he was the 'Last unpaid Bill'. Thought that was pretty clever.\n\nAs we made to leave, he asked if we would bring his couch from the curb back up to the house for him, not sure why he wanted it, didn't ask. So my BIL and I moved the couch and set it next to the house outside of his garage. We wished 'Bill' well, then headed back to the house for dinner. When I got in, I noticed that my shirt smelled of burnt plastic. BIL gave me a sweatshirt to change into, and we had a great birthday celebration before I and the family left about 2 hours later for home.\n\nAround 2:30 the next morning, our phone rang. My wife answered, and I pretended to be more asleep than I actually was so I didn't have to deal with a bad phone call in the wee early hours. They're very seldom about good thing. It was the police department from the town my BIL and SIL lived in. They asked me questions about my activities the previous evening while I was at their house.\n\nThe fucking couch reignited and burned Bill's house down, killing him in the process. The police grilled my BIL, examined his arms, then called me. I don't think I slept well for over a month afterwards, and couldn't get the tragedy out of my head for a long time. I should have known from the smell on my clothes that it wasn't safe to move that damnable couch. I should have put the pieces together, but I was just too interested in getting back to my family to celebrate.\n\nNothing more ever came of it, but I'll never get rid of the knowledge that, if I hadn't committed to one simple action that I had performed, then another human being would not have died. I was relieved when my SIL and BIL moved a couple of years later, because I hated seeing that empty lot every time I went to their house.\n\nThis was maybe 11 years ago, but to this day, about once a year around my mother-in-law's birthday, my brother-in-law and I still have a toast to the Last Unpaid Bill.",

I was so scared that I stayed in the building and it just never collapsed the entire time, so I left out the back. \n\nI often think about that, it was such a quick decision. She was right near the door, I was on my way out because the building felt like it was shaking, and I saw her and said \"run out, the roof is gonna fall!\" and she ran out in a hurry and got blown apart by gunfire, shrieking in pain until she was hit again and presumably died. \n\nI wish I didn't tell her that obviously. It still sort of haunts me to this day, especially her screaming. But I also know that I made the decision in good will... trying to save her life.

    "body": "I was driving from a friend's house last November on a road I've driven a million times. I knew one area was particularly dark at night because the city hadn't replaced the street lights in over a decade. The dark area  also crests a hill in a residential area between two crosswalks that are far apart, so people cross the road at the top of this hill.  Knowing all this, I still never saw him coming. There was a huge thud and my window was cracked all the way across. I turned around and saw him laying motionless on the side walk. It was late and noone else was there, so it was just me (parked on a sidestreet) and this body. I checked his pulse while I was on the phone with 911 bit couldn't feel anything because I was shaking so badly. This was maybe a quarter mile from the hospital so the paramedics were there before I even realized what happened. They put him up on a stretcher with this strange device that I found out later was to automatically compress his chest. The cops showed up and I finally saw my car with a flashlight. There was a large chunk of flesh and blood caught on the side of my car. I passed my sobriety test and they took me home.\n\n\nHe lived for three days before dying due to complications of the accident, and was never conscious during that time. I found out through a friend of mine who's the editor at a local paper that the police were still considering charges (also how I found out that he died).\n\n\nI was obviously a mess about the accident but also the possibility of involuntary manslaughter. After the officer called me to tell me officially that he died, I consulted a lawyer and was basically told not to talk to the police again and to let them conduct their investigation.\n\nTwo grueling weeks later, i got a phone call at midnight from the officer who gave me my sobriety test (he worked third shift). He told be that the guy was incredibly intoxicated and basically stepped into oncoming traffic without paying attention. With that info, I wasn't to be charged and I could go pick my car back up. The relief I felt was indescribable but also terrible that I could feel so great in a situation where someone died. What made that feeling worst was that the officer told me the family of the guy were super concerned with how I was doing and that they wanted to tell me they didn't blame me. \n\nHe was 24 and had just graduated college. It was his last night in town before going back to his hometown. I go to his Facebook page every once in a while just so I don't forget what he looked like. \n\nSorry if this comes through as rambling but I've been actually explained this in writing before.\n\nEDIT: Clarified / spelling on a few things.\n\nEDIT 2: Thank you all very much for your words. There arent a ton of people I can talk to about this because they just get super sad and coddling--so it's a strange breath of fresh air to get some of this stuff out in the open. Thank you.",

    "body": "I'm at least partially responsible for three deaths. \n\nSo I'm a weather forecaster. A few years ago I was forecasting for Afganistan. Now, we were doing these forecasts from a base in the states, which means we had to coordinate our forecast with someone who was deployed to Afghanistan. Sometimes the downrange forecaster was really experienced, other times they weren't. It was a mixed bag. Anyway, I had been forecasting for this region for at least 2 years at the time of this incident. I was familiar with it, and I was actually in a supervisory capacity, simply overseeing all of the forecasts going out in my zone. Well one day I was talking with one of my forecasters about the potential for large hail and how I'd like him to put that in his forecast. Now that's a BIG thing to put in a forecast because of how operationally significant it is. Aircraft must be put in hangars, missions are cancelled, assets must be protected, etc. So when it came time to discuss this with the downrange forecaster, he was absolutely against it. He didn't want to brief that to the commander because again, missions have to be canceled based on what you *think* will happen. If you're wrong, you've set back a lot of.people and wasted a lot of time. So the deployed forecaster tries to argue against it, but his reasoning really just boiled down to \"I don't want to brief that.\" So when i wasn't looking, he essentially just pulled rank on my junior forecaster and forced him to take it out of the forecast. And so it went out to the base with no hail in it, only hinting at some vicinity thunderstorms. Well when I noticed I was pissed but I said screw it, we'll let him be wrong. This was the first time I'd ever wanted to put large hail in a forecast. Maybe we *were* over forecasting it.\n\nNope. Basically right on schedule, a huge thunderstorm popped up and dumped large hail on the base. It did a few million in damage to aircraft, injured a helo pilot who was pre-flighting his bird, and killed 3 Afghan National Army soldiers who had left on a patrol and couldn't find any cover. They wound up beaten to death by hail. That has always bugged me. They didn't need to die. We knew the potential was there and I basically just let an incorrect forecast go out that got them killed.

    "body": "3 lanes wide on my side of the street. I am in the lane closest to the middle of the steeet. I just get through an intersection and see a car attempting to turn in front of me into a gas station. This gas station entrance is close enough to the intersection I just went through that there is no middle section for them to wait in to turn when it is clear.\n\nThey inch into my lane across a double yellow line and stop. I quickly get over to my right one lane. They inch over into the next lane and stop again. I start to panic. Why are they stopping? What is he doing? I quickly see I can get in the far right lane and move over.\n\nThis older man driving... I think he panicked... he tries to gas it past me into the gas station. I'm in a Dodge Dakota and they are in an old Chevy Truck with rack seating. I slow down as much as I can but there is no time. I T-bone them and my car basically slams them into a concrete pole. I stop a couple of feet from a concrete wall myself.\n\nI get out of the car with my adrenaline on full. Im not even sure if im hurt or not, (I cant feel anything any way). I stumble over to their car to see of they are ok. The looks I received from this old man and his wife still haunt me to this day.\n\nThey looked at me like I was the grim reaper coming to claim them... absolute horror... blood coming down their face wondering why I did this to them as smoke from the front of the car looms over them like creeping death.\n\nThe woman died later that day from her injuries at the hospital. The man later tried to sue me but I was cleared of any legal wrong doing based on the investigation that had taken place. They had concluded that I had done everything I could have done to avoid a collision. It was just unfortunate timing that this older gentleman made an illegal driving decision. A decision that i am sure he regretted until the end of his days.\n\nI'm still messed up from this even though it was years and years ago. Getting cleared legally does nothing for one's own conscience and psyche. My vehicle, whether it was intentional or not, was used as an instrument of destruction that ended up killing a man's wife.\n\nI have PTSD flashbacks. If I drive by a similar looking area that looks similar to the accident site I still get such crippling anxiety that I have to disassociate in order to not lose control. I have severe depression, I don't know how I function and survive to be perfectly be honest.\n\nI've run the gamut of emotions over this incident.. I have lost friends, relationships and isolated from my family. Why? I don't feel I deserve what was taken away from others. I'm slowly killing myself daily over it because I can't find any meaning in it. That's because there is no meaning. It was an accident and I don't know how to accept it and move on. I've done different types of therapy, I've taken medication, ive talked to many people about it and nothing has changed.\n\nThe reason I write all of this is to please implore all of you to be safe when you are behind the wheel of any motor vehicle. I did everything I could to be careful and something horrible still happened. I can't even imagine being the same level of reckless I have seen other drivers who end up getting away with it with absolutely no consequences.\n\nI hope with every ounce of my being that no one ever experiences the type of pain and suffering that has become my everyday life and reality. I wouldn't wish this pain, guilt or suffering upon my worst enemy.\n\n",

I didn't want to keep people in the house awake so I spent a lot of time at the gas station.  I'd usually read or talk with the cashier on duty. I think she felt a little safer having someone else there too.\n\nOne night a man comes in with a little boy and asks if they can use the bathroom. It's something like 3 AM.  The kid looks sick or uncomfortable. To me it looked like he'd been punched in the stomach. After they're in the bathroom the cashier and I look at each other. She thinks there's something off about this too. I went outside to get a description of the vehicle. After they leave we call the police.\n\nThe local police passed it along to the county sheriff's department and a local officer came to the gas station. He asked us a couple more questions and we listened to his radio to hear what was happening. \n\nA county officer spots the truck and pulls it over. After the officer gets out of the car the truck backs into it and takes off. The police pursue him. We didn't get a lot of details after that. He crashed or abandoned the truck. The truck was on fire and loose rounds of ammunition was going off in the truck.

I lived in Fort Lauderdale at the time. I was heading back from a party at a friends house, pretty bleary eyed. I had slept for a few hours and then got in my car. I was running out of gas so I stop at a gas station right off of I-95 before heading north (to home). \n\nA guy walks up to me while I'm pumping gas and he asks for directions. He was older, and a bit drunk. He came off as a yachtie, and yachties are really common in that part of town (I had a bunch of yachtie friends so he didn't sketch me out, but I immediately kind of wrote him off). I told him to take I-95 north. He stumbles off and gets on his vespa (scooters are super common in South Florida), and then drives away.\n\nI go inside, get a drink, then sit in my car for a few minutes (waking up) before going. I hit the highway and I'm cruising north when I see a TON of emergency lights coming down the southbound side. I remember thinking \"oh shit something's going down\". I start paying closer attention to the road in front of me and there are lights in my rear view too, coming up really fucking gast. \n\nWhat happened next was kind of a blur and is NWS:\n\nThere were recognisable body parts in the road. part of an arm, an upper torso with the head attached, blood everywhere. Bits and pieces of plastic and metal in the road and lumps of flesh or organ or something. I didn't see any of it until I was extremely close, but the image is something that has really fucked me up. \n\nI called my mom... she said I was incoherent and screaming about blood. FHP checked my car (which had blood on it but no damage) the next day, and the officer explained to me an older white male on a scooter had gotten on I-95 north. He merged inappropriately and was hit by a dump truck, and his corpse was hit by several other vehicles including mine... \n\nThey closed I-95 for the entire morning, well past rush hour. The news article said that remains and debris were strewn across an area the size of a football field. \n\nI sold my car and moved. The first two months were very rough, but I'm feeling better now. (Despite shaking atm)\n\nTL;DR: I told a stranger to take the highway. He did so on a scooter. I drove through the aftermath of my advice. ",

    "body": "My mom is Thai and my dad is American so I spend most of the year in the US and summers in Thailand. When I was eight my family and my cousin's family were at the beach in Cha-Am. My cousin's son, James, and I had been playing in the ocean for hours by this time and we were both exausted. Since we began playing the water got much more violent with large waves as a thunderstorm was starting. As soon as my parents heard lightning they yelled for us to come back to the shore and I just started swimming back without checking to see if James was following. When I walked up onto the sand I looked back and I couldn't see him. We were much farther out than two eight year old should've been and James was too tired to keep himself above the water. I'm not sure what I could've done once I realised I couldn't find him but I can't stop thinking about it, and when I go back to the condo there I can't bring myself to get back into the ocean. \n\nEdit: I think James and I were actually both eight but he was much smaller.\n\nSecond edit: Everyone responding has been incredibly supportive and it means the world. I know realistically I couldn't change what happened but that can't stop me from wishing I could. Thank you again to everyone for the kind words. ",

    "body": "Warning: This is a fucked-up story, with only losers.\n\nI was 14 years old, it was a Sunday afternoon, somewhere in Europe. I was returning from a soccer match with my dad and two neighbours, friends of my dad. Going through my neighbourhood, we met a new neighbour, they had moved in a few weeks earlier. He was returning from a hunting trip, and was unloading a couple of rifles from his car. We said hello, and chatted for a bit. Curious, 14 year old me couldn't take my eyes of the rifles, I had never before seen anything like it up close. He noticed, and asked if I wanted to hold it. Of course I wanted too! My father and one of the others asked something along the lines of \"It isn't loaded, I presume?\". The hunter said \"Of course it isn't!\" and handed me the gun. The moment I took it, it went off, hitting his 7-year old daughter, who came running from the backside of the house, more or less in the middle of the chest. She was dead before the ambulance arrived. She was their only child, and had celebrated her 7th birthday just days prior.\n\nThe aftermath was a lot of police, investigations and a generally bad time. It felt like I fell down a dark, empty hole, and shut myself completely in. I don't remember much from the years that followed, I existed, but that was it.\n\nLegally, I was aquitted, everyone agreed that the hunting neighbour had stated the gun wasn't loaded, and that he practically insisted on me holding it. The hunter himself got some kind of suspended jail sentence.\n\nThe years since has been bad for most involved. The hunter was divorced from his wife shortly after. I heard he got some kind of depression and apparently has been in and out of a mental hospital. His wife is consumed by hatred, and shows up to threaten me any time she can find me. I have moved repeatedly, and even changed my name, but she still find me regularly. I have filed several court orders against her, and she is forbidden to come closer than a few km from me, but that doesn't stop her. She has never hurt me physically, though, but she usually say that she'll kill me one day.\n\nMy father took this very hard, and was in dark place for years. He is now retired, and spends most of his time doing various volunteer work for youth organizations and the like. I know it his way of doing some kind penance. My mother died a few years ago, and was an amazing support for me, even though we never discussed the incident or the dead girl.\n\nI was never able to get back into any kind of meaningful education, barely managing to finish my countrys version of high school. I now live and work with my brother, and I'm doing kinda OK. I never speak to anyone about this, except my father.\n\ntl;dr - neighbour asked if I wanted to hold his rifle, it went off, killing his daughter.\n\nedit: I didn't intend to ever access this account again, but just a few comments:\n\n- Thanks for your sympathy, thoughts and warming words. I really means a lot.\n\n- Regarding the trigger, and why the gun went off: I honestly don't know. I probably put my finger on the trigger as I was handed the gun. Remember, I had never seen a live gun before, my only experience with guns was television (I haven't even been a gamer, ever, only a soccer game at a friends house). I know the official report, which I probably have someplace, say something about the gun, the trigger and the probable reasons why it went off, but at the time I just blocked everything. I don't really feel like reading it anyway, it doesn't matter now and will only bring me pain.\n\n- The mother is arrested with regular and irregular intervals, and I know she was at least heavy fined some time ago. She is regarded as a low threat according to the police (no violent history ever), and I think she is considered mostly noise and no action. This kind of court orders is not very common in my country, and I think not very high priority with the police. To be frank, I am not very afraid of this woman, she is mostly a very unpleasant reminder of my own guilt, and everytime I see her I get a very negative reaction that can last for days or weeks.",

    "body": "Copied from a similar thread I posted in a few months back: \n\nBack in the mid 2000's I was going through a divorce. My whole emotional state was in chaos. I was pretty much a functioning alcoholic. And very, very angry.\n\nSo I went to a gas station to get smokes after a particularly bad fight with my wife (we were selling the house that I had built) and I was so angry, so hurt.\n\nAs I was pulling out of the gas station some guy came rocketing out of the car wash area and cut me off. Being in the state of mind I was in I let loose a long spew of profanity at him, really nasty stuff.\n\nHe must have been having a bad day because before I knew it he was in park and around the front end of his car coming at me with his hands up. I boxed Golden Gloves in my youth and the hands up is a universal sign, I was in my car with the window down and very vulnerable. His front end was blocking mine and I was boxed in.\nSo I jumped out of my car and stepped out of the door's way and the dude was literally 5 feet from me coming at me with a vengeance. Hands up and ready.\n\nSo I threw a straight right at him. I don't remember trying to throw it hard, I just did it kind of like a batter with two strikes trying to protect the plate. It worked. I hit him right on the point of the chin. His eyes rolled up immediately and he started going down. He went down like this, only sideways and hit the side of his head on a curb. It was the first part of him to touch the ground.\n\nAnd it killed him. Brain bleed. He lasted a week I think. He had other medical issues as well that exacerbated it (his wife and I talked a lot at the hospital). She never blamed me which I am very thankful for because I sure blamed myself for many, many years. Turned into a non functioning alcoholic, was almost homeless. My whole body hurts thinking about this.\n\nI still feel awful, still cry it out sometimes. I used to have nightmares about his 2 daughters. They were teenagers. They needed their daddy. And my actions took that from them.",

At the last minute, I changed the plans on us to go swimming and staying at my family's lake house instead, because beds... and TV and stuff. First night and it in the water, we decided to swim out to the middle of the lake and just tread water and laugh and splash around. After a while we all swam back to the dock and I was second to last in front of Tommy. \n\nTommy never got out. I dove back in but couldn't find him anywhere. We had no phone in the cabin so after I ran back up the hill I ran Barefoot down the gravel road to the main road then to the nearest neighbors house hysterical. They called the police and then at the end divers found him about 12 feet from the end of the dock. \n\nI blamed myself horribly for the change of our plans. I sat through the funeral numbly while his parents lied to me about how much he looked forward for weeks to the swimming trip.

My best friend had been living with me for 2 or so years and was constantly making poor financial choices that fell on me and I would nag. We eventually got kicked out of one place due to this and I raged at him, but ultimately forgave him because even after all of his shortcomings he was always there when I needed someone. Fast forward to me being gone for the weekend, I get home and check my financials and see that there are some weird food or charges on there. I call the places and ask where they were delivered to and realize he'd used my credit card to buy food. Now I'd given him money when he needed it before because I will not let someone go hungry, but to steal was the last straw and I lost it absolutely lost it and just unleashes everything on him. He refuses to admit that he did it and tried to hide the pizza boxes. He proceeds to get absolutely wasted that night and tries to say that his grandfather was sick in the hospital to I guess get me to break my anger. Then next day I text him that he will either admit to it and pay me back, which seems easy, or I will have to get the cops involved. About 3 hours after that text was sent I get a hysterical call from my girlfriend that he has shot himself. It was a year this past April, I know I am told not to feel like I'm to blame, but I still think about it every day.

It was maybe 3am and it was driving in circles all around town, not going anywhere in particular. It seemed to me the driver was drunk so I pulled him over and went to talk.\n\n Turns out to be two college age guys, about 20 years old. They were behaving strangely and were somewhat incoherent, clearly intoxicated but didn't smell of alcohol. Driver turns out to have a suspended license so he is going to jail, I have no choice in the matter. Search the car and find an almost empty bottle of vodka and it soon becomes clear their eratic driving was from them trying to chug it and hide it. Both were showing more and more signs of intoxication and now reeked of booze as their bodies started absorbing what was in their stomach\n\nSo its all in all a pretty minor deal, in the grand scheme of things. Suspended license is the most minor of arrestable offenses, spend an hour in jail being processed and then sent on your way. Passenger talks his way into getting arrested too but its for underage drinking, also very minor. No DUI, I promised him I wouldn't if he would come clean about what substances he was on, I was more worried we were about to have an overdose or bad pills/alcohol mix on our hands.\n\n3 days later get a call to a house for an unresponsive subject, turns out to be my driver from the other night. He hung himself because he was so distraught over his run-in with the law. I learned that he had some other arrests that year, had a crappy job, an alcoholic family, and my arrest was the final straw.\n\nIts not my fault, just happened to be the last in a series of mistakes he made and he decided enough was enough, he didn't want to be responsible for any of it anymore. I don't feel bad, I was doing my job and I think we can all agree getting a drunk of the road is good, its just a bit eye-opening that an event so minor to me is enough to trigger a suicide in someone else.",

Since he usually asked this of me just to talk about random stuff, I didn't think too much of it and just planned to reply back to him after I was done with my gaming session.  A couple of hours later I finally replied back to him, but he didn't reply back which I thought was weird but was probably just him being busy.  He never replied again.  I found out the next day at school that he had committed suicide around the same time that I was gaming.  I can't help but think that I could've talked him out of it if I had replied to him immediately.  To this day I still feel guilty about it, and I've resolved to never let a friend down like that again.....too bad I didn't have that thinking sooner.",

It was my job to pull the ski bar down but I couldn't due to the positing of people in the lift. Long story short, my friend ended up slipping and I was holding onto her as she dangled off the lift. I was wearing thick skiing gloves so my grip on her was loose. She was screaming so much but she stopped for a second, looked me in the eye and said: 'please don't let go'. And then my grip gave in and she fell about 4 stories into some rocks near a river. We were shouting at the lift operator but he was too slow to react. The girl died from internal bleeding and shock, as he legs twisted in a fucked up way when she landed. She went into cardiac arrest and died. I was questioned profusely by the police and was treated as a suspect. I was bullied endlessly, both online and irl. In the end I blamed myself and I still do to this day.

There are days your hands are a tiny bit shakey and you miss that vein or trachea, etc.      \nBut I will always remember the first one, as a fresh paramedic : 65y/o old male with chest pain,just had his birthday yesterday. Now presents with chest pain. For this we give nitroglycerin as a spray. Works well, but has a downside: It reacts massively&violently with Viagra, etc.(Which was a brand new drug on the market back then)      \nI asked the patient if he took any medication, he says no.        \nNow the seasoned paramedics already know where this is heading. I of course forgot to ask the wife to leave ghe the room and ask again. Because he visited a hooker for his birthday.        \nHe crashed half a minute after I gave him the nitroglycerin and despite all efforts died on scene.        \nEDIT: As it is asked a lot: We found out about his secret 'birthday' party via the police investigation. Every death that is non expected in my country mandates a police investigation to rule out any wrongdoings. One of his friends told police the truth. And I'm fairly sure the family received the police report as well.           \nEDIT2: Nowadays it is protocol for most services to explain to the patient that he will most likely die if the has taken any Viagra, etc. The consequences were known back then (1999 - merely months after it became available in my neck of the woods) as well, but we weren't as explicitly trained on it - it needed a few cases like the one above to change training and push that scenario into every healthcare professionals mind.",

    "body": "About a year and a half ago I've bought my first car. I'm 28 years old now. A couple of months after getting a driver's license. I've taken additional lessons with an instructor after getting the license because I wasn't too confident in my ability to operate a motor vehicle. Responsible, right? I'm from a former USSR country and the situation took place there, so the drivers and roads are shitty and all in all it was a good decision, but that's not the point.\n\nSo, few months fly by, I am doing okay, no accidents or any problems at all, occasional minor hiccups here and there, but everything is alright. One day I was in the tire shop, changed my front tires as one of them was damaged. They are done replacing my tires, I'm ready to drive away and that was the moment shit went south.\n\nI'm starting to reverse from a tall-ish curb, behind me is a quiet road as the shop is located in a kind of a pocket, so maybe a car leaving a parking lot nearby or an occasional pedestrian. As my back wheels leave the curb the car rolls a bit quicker and that's when I see the shop guys waving their hands for me to stop.\n\nI jump out of the vehicle and see an old lady on the ground bleeding from a small wound on her head. I realize what happened, start fucking panicking inside, but I help treating her wound, call the ambulance and the police and try to calm the lady down. As I learned later she was 90 fucking years old, practically deaf and as life would have it, she was on the way to pick a state subsidized hearing device. A minor bump from the car that would leave a younger person mildly annoyed was enough to send her to the ground. She was a partisan medic in WW2 and fought against nazis.\n\nSo, I'm informed by the police investigator that hitting anything while reversing is 100% on the driver, her almost 60 years old son is screaming that he'll kill me and the situation looks fucking grim.\n\nAfterwards I've visited her in the hospital, her son was not mad anymore, he's a driver himself and understood that shitty accidents happen. She had a minor gash in the head, a fractured hand and some pelvis fractures. Doctors didn't give her much time considering her age.\n\nI've completely paid for her treatment, moved her from the hospital back home, paid for a nurse to attend her while her son was working but it didn't help much as she died some 3-4 months later. Her injuries have practically healed completely and she was almost able to walk again but such damage in her age was not really recoverable completely.\n\nI've paid for the funeral and other expenses that came along, made amends with her son, he wasn't really angry at me anymore and that was it, in a way. The legal side of the question is being worked on, the courts are slow here, my lawyer said that I would get a probation in the worst case as jail time is rarely given for criminal cases like this one, more so considering the extenuating circumstances such as not leaving the scene of an accident, calling the police/ambulance and paying for everything.\n\nAs a conclusion, I want to say that this whole ordeal sucks balls, I'm guilty, of course, even though I couldn't physically notice her as I was reversing from a curb and she was a small old lady walking behind the back pillar of the car outside the line of sight. This incident has taught me to pay attention at all times and to double check everything that I might not be able to see on the road. As you should also do.\n\nP.S. I'm sorry for any mistakes, English is obviously not my first language.",

    "body": "I was 17 years old leaving school, it had just stopped raining. A bus was stopped at a red light in the right lane as I was slowing down to stop behind the bus. As the light turned green the bus wasn't moving so I moved to the left lane to go through the intersection. The bus still wasn't moving, even though traffic had a green light the bus waved some pedestrians across the cross walk (pedestrians had a red). By the time they walked in front of the bus I didn't have much time to react. I slammed on my brakes and turned my wheel as hard as I could. \n\nMy truck spun around and my bed hit something. I spun until I came to a stop across the street. I was praying my truck hit the bus. \n\nI hit a 16 year old fellow female student. \n\nShe was picked up and flown into Seattle, she died 4 hours later. \n\n\nEDIT: Wow, this thread and reading others stories. The guilt of other commenters feels too familiar. I have to admit I'm trying not to cry. I feel for all of you.  And the commenters on my post, you guys are great.    Thank you. ",

I didnt get a chance to read his file right away so for the first week or so I had no idea why this kid acted the way he did. \nA few times a day he would destroy his whole room and throw all of his things at the staff and then sit in the middle of the room very still and stare out the window for hours. It's the closest thing I've ever seen to someone being catatonic. \n\nSo I read his file...about two years earlier, and the reason he's ended up in the home, was because he had found a lighter on the ground outside and brought it home. I don't remember all the details, but for some reason he was sent to his room and out of anger lit something on fire and it quickly got out of control. \nHis entire family died. He was the only survivor. ",

    "body": "My grandma used to live with us and actually raised me and my sister since my parents were busy working. She would take us to school, prepare our lunch and so on but since my other aunts wouldn't come visit her -not wanting to bother my family, they would say- my mom eventually bought an apartment in the same street as our house for her to live alone.\n\nEveryday on my way to school and back I would walk past her house but was too lazy to stop by and spend 10 minutes with her and I guess my aunts were too. I guess they just used the \"dont want to bother you guys\" as an excuse not to visit grandma.\n\nShe started coming to my house to bring food and chit chat a bit. Then started bringing me money so I could treat myself. Later she straight up showed up asking me to come to her house have lunch or dinner whenever I had time. I would always say I'd try but wasn't sure when because I was busy because of school. At that time I was 2nd year med school student and although I was indeed busy I would rather spend my leisure time gaming or hanging out with friends rather then visiting her. Yeah, that was my excuse, guess I didn't truly love her either.\n\nOne day my mom asked me to go visit her because she was not feeling well, so I did. When I got there I saw her laying on bed in a not so good overall state, which was very uncommon of her since she has always been an active person despite the age. My mom told me she has been peeing a lot lately and then suddently started getting worse and worse. When I talked to her she was mumbling some random sentences but I thought she was just too tired to have a proper conversation. I was a little worried and told my mom and one aunt who was there at that moment that we should take her to the hospital because none of that seemed normal to me. I remember clearly the response I got. My aunt said out loud \"Hey grandma our little doctor says we should take you to the hospital but I think we can take good care of you right?\" I dont know if it was a last gift or a sick joke from god/universe but that was the last time I saw my grandma lucid. The big old proud smile in my grandma's face after hearing that I was her \"little doctor\" still haunts me today. \n\nWe ended up not taking her to the hospital that night and when we eventually did, it was too late. She died from sepsis due to uti. Now that I think back it was so clear, all the signs were so obvious, I should've done the diagnosis or at least I should've trusted my gut instincts and insisted a little more on taking her to the hospital. \n\nI know it's not all my fault. I know rationally that I didn't kill her. It was a misfortune. I know. But deep down in my heart I feel that my sloth killed her a little bit. My negligence, my excuses, my lack of confidence, my lack of knowledge, I think all this killed her a little bit and her medical condition was just the final blow. I know I shouldn't blame myself, I really do! But there's still this \"what If\" feeling that I cant shake off everytime I walk back home and walk past in front of her house - now with someone else living in it. \n\nI still feel so ashamed and so sorry that I have never visited her in the cemitery after the funeral. It has been 4 years now.\n\nEdit: Thanks everyone for the kind words. Really, it felt good just to write this and take it off my chest but the comments really made my day! Sorry the format of the text, I was on mobile but hopefully it's easier to read now. Also, english is not my first language so please excuse any grammar/vocabulary error\n\n",

I remember being quite nice to him whenever we were on our own but being quite insecure myself at the time I ve also been a douche to him in the group a few times.  \nIt was definitely lifechanging and shaped my character to the better. Its just scary that you completely fail to realize what such actions can do to somebody when youre a teenager.  \n\nEdit: On a sidenote, there were definitely more things to it as we have realized afterwards. He immigrated to us from Albania, had no father and certainly nobody to talk to about these things. Close before his death he openly dealed with satanic rituals and such. At that time he also had a girlfriend who shared these things with him and probably also had a hard time.  \nRegarding the questions about how everyone felt: I cant even say how the real bullies felt after that. We havent been talking about it much anymore. I can definitely say, that noone ever came out with how much he has liked him or such but I suppose, they have all been in sorrow privately. I know, that they have all turned into more or less good people afterall.  \n\nAlso despite the fact, that I accept having been part of it, I still dont consider myself a bully. I was also always on the lower end of the food chain, as I developed very late and looking like a young boy in a class of 30 young men is definitely a think you need to stand. But still, there is no excuse to ever join such a bullytrain on a weaker guy. The most important conclusion I have from that time is, that you as a parent are asked more than ever to deal with the problems of your child and never let him out alone in the rain.  \nTeenagers can be so incredibly cruel and they dont have ability to realize the impact of such actions.",

I was devastated, I still cared about him despite us breaking up. I of course asked about arrangements, and my Dad said, \"your mother and I will go to pay respects.\" I was outraged, insisting I should go. \n\nWhen I got there, I quickly realized several of his family members/friends clearly blamed me for his death.

My parents assumed I had been speeding (I hadn't) and made me feel horrible about killing her for years. It took 6 years until my brother finally had the decency to tell them that he gave the car to me knowing it's breaks were almost useless. ",

    "body": "Backstory, When I was about 16, me and some friends were smoking and playing cards in a shut down store owned by a friends dad. As we were playing his dad (said friend wasn't there, it was three others and I)  showed up, he was a lil Hispanic man about 5'4, comes in talking trash to this woman in English. He hung up looked at us and we laughed cause it was horrible English, and well, we were high. She shows up and he says \" watch guys, she's crazy for me\". After the two were talking for about three minutes in the corner, us kids just kept to ourselves playing cards smoking. \nThe lady being about 5'10, 6',  starts socking him in the face with keys in between her fingers like a wolverine movie. Puts a big hole in his nose close to his eye, we all react and get up nervously, and he grabs her by the throat, again him being like 5'4, and begins walking her backward. She was barely on her heels trying to keep her balance, and with a thrust he throws her toward the wall, I swear her body was like 4 feet off the ground flat. Her head hits the wall and goes in, her body goes limp and literally hangs like 4inches off the floor  by her head. We noped the fuck out. But before we left, we saw her pull her head out and drop, looking around dazed and the first words said..... why don't you love me..... we couldn't believe it, more happened but no cops were involved idk why, and we convinced her to go home. We went into the store the next day, the hole where her head was was an inch from the stud. \nTwo weeks later a murder-suicide shows up on the news.. he shot her with a shotgun, held her body and offed himself. \nI know I didn't have control, but I always, always question how I could have prevented it. I'm 24 now and still can't believe what played out that night. \nSorry for bad grammar, I'm shaking now thinking about it.  Im just trying to put it all out before I'd question it and delete what was typed. ",

He had this weird extended family from overseas and there were plenty of people coming and going from his life. One day we were playing with Legos and waiting for our mothers to come home and he says he wants to show me something, he comes back with a small stack of papers that were given to him by his much older cousins boyfriend, Jimmy. As far as I could tell the pictures were printed off on some shitty printer, this is almost 20 years ago now, and what was on them appeared to be underage Asian girls. I literally WTF straight away and recognised that this sick fuck Jimmy was grooming this kid. (I was abused myself), I digress, the first thing I did when our mothers got home was to tell them and show them both the papers. They get his cousin over and tell her, she then goes to confront Jimmy. That night as far as I know,  he went out to kill himself, breaks into a locked and condemned jetty on the seafront and throws himself in. His body was washed up on the shore. As I said I'd dealt with abuse in my childhood and I'm glad I prevented my friend from it. Im glad Jimmy died and I'm glad that I can connect myself directly to his suicide. The person that abused me is dead too but that was from old age... the world is shit. I don't know if my friend ever was told what happened to Jimmy or if he even knew what went on. I hope he never had to find out what actually happened.\n\nTLDR; killed a nonce.\n\nEdit: thanks for your replies. It means a lot.",

Her life had fallen apart in a horrible devorce between her parents in her senior year of high school. All her college fund was wasted in legal fees.

After their devorce and her mother disowning her for not lying about her side of the story in court, she moved away with her dad. Started getting into oxy.  Thanksgiving rolls around... She calls me and asks for money... Seemed fine, I wanted a receipt... 6 hours later she OD'd on heroin.  There was no funeral. Barely a blurb in the paper.  She was just erased... It kills me to think about how she used to be so smart and ready for the world and how it all crushed her. Fuck drugs. Fuck parents who can't even see what they are doing wrong. Fuck me for trusting her. I knew she was an addict. She's gone now.\n\nEdit: spelling and grammar.

Thank you for the gold, again I appreciate the thought.  I just wanted to vent, but I'm doing fine really.  She was the first girl I ever loved and part of me always knew after everything went South for her that her suicide was always a possibility. I regret not calling the appropriate authorities before it got that bad more than even the money I gave her that she used to kill herself.  I know it would not have mattered and I know I could only have done so much to make a real difference. But I want everyone else to know that when someone cannot handle this world and it's harsh realities... It's not your fault.\n\n ",

The truck moved to get in front of the semi but over corrected when they turned too soon and ended up turning into the median ditch. The truck flipped into the air and spun about 7 times while the driver was ejected thru the windshield. The truck and driver landed on the opposite lanes of the highway. Keep in mind we are in the desert so no traffic or help around. The semi kept driving but I braked and ran to provide help. The driver was face up staring at me while the back of the head was opened. I recall their blood looking more jelly than anything. The driver was still breathing ragged but couldn't talk. I held the skull closed just as another car stopped and came to help. I directed one of the people to bring a blanket and the other to call 911. By then more cares were arriving so I told the rest of them to go provide traffic control and check the truck for anyone else. I didnt want to move the driver for fear of spinal injuries so I sat with them holding their skull closed on their back. He passed in my arms and we covered them with a blanket. 911 came about 15 mins later. I was 19 when the Incident happened. I know it's not my fault but I still think about that driver from time to time. If I had not been there at that exact moment they could still be alive.

I guess I drove us back to my friends house at some point. \n\nAt my friends house we hung out in the garage for a few minutes but we all thought we had to go home right away for some reason, maybe because it was so late. Either way I realize I'm waaay to drunk to drive and I give my keys to my brother who swears he is able to drive drunk perfectly fine. \nSo we get up to leave and the friend who's house we were at just starts begging us to sleep over and just leave in the morning, there were couches and his parents wouldn't care. But we were too stubborn. I convince my brother we have to go home, since I don't want to get in trouble so we stumble outside and leave making it home at some point. I just remember waking up to vomit multiple times. \n\nLater the next day I try to hit up my other friend who also had to leave that night. His name was Chance, a fantastic intelligent guy, sometimes a dick but never with bad intentions, he was just really honest. He doesn't respond, for days, we always would get in a Skype call and play CS or whatever pretty much everyday but he just wasn't responding to anything. \n\nThen before I'm about to just go to his house I get a call that's he's in the hospital in critical condition, his brain had essentially shut off after he crashed his motercycle into the back of a truck. He ended up being euthanized and his family donated most of his organs. I don't go a single day without thinking about him. I should've just told everyone to sleep that night, I don't know why I wanted to go home so bad. Never drive drunk, it's just not worth it ever. I miss my friend ",

We were going back for him to drop me off at the dorm, and we were talking about something I don't remember.\n\nAs we took the unlit exit ramp off the highway, we saw a motorcycle lying down in the middle of the only lane we could be in. My dad swerved to the right, dodging it by about a foot. In the next few seconds, I saw a dark lump on the ground, felt a jarring bump as we went over it at around 30 mph, and we stopped. The bump didn't feel like much more than a big speed bump.\n\nI looked out the rearview window and saw the bike lying around we swerved, but I couldn't see the lump we went over. I was about to get out of the car, I think, and looked over to my dad. I don't remember the exact words said, but he said something like \"let's get off the ramp.\" So we drive off.\n\nAnd we kept going. The car was dead silent, and about 1000 feet or so ahead a car pulls up to the right of us with people screaming at us to stop, and that we just ran somebody over. My dad yelled back that we're finding a place to park, but they were frantic. So, we stopped. 2 or 3 more cars stopped too. We get out of the car, and an entire family gets out of the car that stopped us. 2 adult children, their parents, and a grandparent as well.\n\nI noticed a long streak behind us that was darker the road, and I looked under the car to see a bloody, dead man we dragged the entire way. I didn't look for longer than a couple of seconds, and I think I went into shock because I don't remember much more than the rest below.\n\nCops came, we gave statements saying we were just going to stop a bit ahead and call the police, and I'm quite sure the family gave statements saying it seemed like we didn't intend to stop. \n\n\nI haven't spoken to my father in a few months now, and I every time I think of calling, this story comes to mind. It happened more than a few months ago, and when we did talk about it all I asked was if anything happened with the police again later. I really do feel like we would've kept going and tried to forget the entire thing if he didn't get stabbed and stuck underneath our car. I wonder if he was dead before a lot, and I'm pretty sure he wasn't until we killed him.",

When she was young, probably around 8 or 9, she was tasked with watching her younger brother (who was 4 or 5) while her parents would work on the farm. They would usually play in front of the house, and were always advised to stay away from the barn, because there were a lot of things that they could get into in the barn. One day, while their parents were working, they went and were playing hide and seek inside the barn. She counted down, and went to find her brother. She went into the barn, and thought that he might have climbed up into the loft, where the hay was stored. She ended up trying to climb a rope up to the loft, which ended up dislodging a huge bale of hay which slid off the edge of the shelf and crushed her brother who was hiding nearby. She told me this story about 5 years ago, but everytime I remember her telling me I can recall her facial expression when she told me. You could tell it really shook her up, and that it was something she was stilling battling, 10+ years later.",

There was a small island in the lake we lived near, we figured we could swim to it. My buddy went first he floated the camera gear out on a buoy l went second and my other friend went third. Suddenly I heard him yell for help, he was struggling in the water. I swam back to help him. I swam him up to the docks and I put his hands on the docks, pulled myself out of the lake and turned around and he was gone. I yelled quickly for my other friend and dove in. I saw him drifting down into the water, I panicked, like really panicked and thought I was going to drown, so I resurfaced for air. After that no matter how many times we dove in we couldn't see him beneath the murk. Took us between 7 and 10 mins to get him out. We did CPR to the best of our abilities for as long as we could until a passer by managed to get the police to us. Then everyone just left, and we were alone freezing in our skivvies on the dock at night. They told us later in the hospital that he didn't make it. He was one of our closest friends, a brother. I'll never ever be able to forgive myself for panicking in that key moment, if I had stayed calm and just gone for him I could have pulled him out in time. I was weak and my friend died because of that. It's been 12 years and it haunts me every day of my life. It's certainly altered the course of my life. \n\nI can see him sometimes in my dreams just floating there against that formless blackness that is a deep murky lake bed. Tough to let go I guess.",

In fact by now I know I didn't. But back then... And for a lot of years to follow, I thought I did. I've blamed myself on and off ever since. \n\nI was watching my sister in our front yard. She was my responsibility. This wasn't too uncommon, we lived in a good neighborhood. Being kids, I didn't really.... Care as much as I should have. I mean it's our yard right? She was a kid so she... Didn't think and look. She was hit by a car. She was eleven years old and she was my responsibility. She was always better than me. She would have made the world a better place. \n\nEdit: Thank you so much for the support guys. I should clarify something though: \n\nIt was poor word choice on my part to say my responsibility to watch her. It wasn't like I was... Truly responsible, she was 11 after all, as was I. The reality is more that I'm putting this on myself, on my own. It's nothing but me telling myself that she was my responsibility. I was always the forward one, the one to take charge and the one to take care of her. So I kind of... Viewed it as my fault. \n\nEdit 2: Just read through all the comments. I never once said she was crossing the street without looking. You realize that even adults get hit by cars right? A lot of you also assume that she was just crossing the street, but she wasn't. We had built a little jump on the sidewalk and were jumping our BMX's off it. She swung around in a half circle to catch speed, came out behind our fathers pickup into the street and was hit by a neighbor. Of course she should have thought of that. But it happens, everybody can have a temporary lapse of judgement. ",

Lived in a group home, truant from school, combative, stole from family members, basically anything to rebel, I did it. My grandfather never gave up on me. Well in to my late teens he called me his little buddy. He was the best person I ever met, and my family tells me that he would be so proud of me for turning my life around. \n\nTwo days before my 20th birthday I went to visit my grandfather in the hospital. He was recovering from a hip replacement and was bed ridden. I showed up with my boyfriend to say hi. We talked for about 30 minutes, and he suddenly got restless. He wasn't supposed to be out of his bed, or really sitting up without a nurse to supervise. I didn't know this at the time. He started to pull himself out of bed to sit in a chair next to his bed. I could not bear to see him in pain, and I was trying to keep it together because I was about to cry. He didn't ever want to appear weak or helpless, so he refused my help when I tried to offer it. The nurse came in to give him his medicine and started laying in on him for trying to get out of bed. He fussed at her and she very sternly told him that she had told him multiple times that he was to call for help if he needed anything. I decided that I had reached my limit. He was really upset that I was leaving. I hugged my grandfather and told him that I would see him the following weekend to celebrate my birthday with the family, since I wanted to wait until he was home to celebrate it with them. As soon as I was out of the room, I had been there for maybe just under an hour, I broke down and bawled. Something didn't feel right. The next morning I woke up at 530am, I'm the type to sleep until noon on my days off. I just laid there, wide awake. My phone rang and I ignored it because it was my uncle and I knew. I just fucking knew. I listened to the voicemail, \"hey barelyknowso, I just wanted to let you know that dad passed this morning\". I remember going to my sisters bed and telling her. She started crying. My Mom heard it and came out, so I told her. She hugged us and cried. I just fucking stood there. I didn't cry, I just felt numb. I was later told by my Dad that my grandfather was found in the bathroom on the ground. When they tried to get him back in to bed, he fought them off and told them that no one cared about him and he wanted to die. It eats at me to this day. I'm almost 31. No one knew that I went to visit him the day before. This was one of the only people in my life that never gave up on me, I just left because I didn't want to think about him being in pain, when I should have thought more about how he didn't want to be alone. \n\nThe next day after he passed was my birthday. I shopped for shoes for the funeral, received a birthday card from my grandparents that said \"love you, grandma and grandpa\" and two days after that my boyfriend broke up with me via email because I had become 'needy'. \n\nEdit: words\n",

    "body": "I was 15 almost 16 and learning to drive. I had my learner's permit and could operate a car with parental supervision. I was with my dad driving home from school one evening, when I came to a crosswalk where two people were waiting to pass. I asked my dad if I should let them go, and he said \"Yes, it's always important to yield to pedestrians and let them cross.\" So I let them go. They smiled and waved. I waved back. I remember one man had a fountain soda. \n\nA moment later, a drunk driver came speeding around a blind corner in a truck from the other direction and slammed into the first pedestrian. I later learned the driver was going around 60mph in a 25 zone. The pedestrian was sent flying about 60 feet down the road \u2013 his soda ended up all over our windshield. It happened so fast. I was in shock. My dad jumped into action. He pulled me out of the driver's seat, gave me his phone and told me to call 911. He then flipped around and went after the drunk driver, who was fleeing the scene. As my dad was pulling away, he told me not to go look at the man who was hit \u2013 he could see that other people were already running to help him. I called the police and listened to my dad. I never went over to see the man, which I'm thankful for. I could hear from the screams that it was not good. \n\nMy dad caught up to the drunk driver enough to get his license plate number, which he reported to the police when he returned. It seemed like he was gone forever, but it was only a few minutes. I gave a report to the police in a complete daze. Sadly, the pedestrian passed away from his serious injuries a couple days later in the hospital. Thankfully, the drunk driver was arrested and charged. He's still in prison I believe. \n\nThe experience messed me up for a long time. I wouldn't drive down that road anymore on the way home. I couldn't get the idea out of my mind that if I hadn't stopped and let the pedestrians cross, the man wouldn't have been hit and killed. I knew it wasn't my fault, but I felt responsible. I had nightmares for months afterward \u2013 sometimes it would play out in my dream as it happened in reality, but sometimes the truck would swerve and strike my dad and me head-on. Then I'd wake up in a panic. It was the first time I really started to seriously contemplate fate, freewill, and mortality. Why him and not us? To this day I don't like going down that road, and I feel for the family of the man who was killed. Life is fragile and fleeting.  \n\ntl;dr\n\nWhile I was learning to drive, I stopped at a crosswalk and let pedestrians cross \u2013 one of them was hit and killed by a drunk driver as a result. \n\n",

    "body": "When i was 16 i was at a church retreat with an age group between 6-18. The retreat site had a nice indoor basketball court and some of us older kids decided to play dodgeball. The game was nearing the end and it was just me left on one side and another guy on the other side. He was really good and i... well i was good a dodging but my throws were unimpressive to say the least. Eveyone was cheering one to see who was gonna win. While i was concentrating on dodging the next incoming ball one of the younger children, 6 years old, decided to walk on the court on my side, i didnt see him at all as i was running full sprint across the court to dodge the ball. I tripped over something i didnt see or expect and went flying across the court. It hurt a lot as i pretty much just landing on hard wood floor, but no one showed any concern for my situation, so i got up to see wtf was going on. Then i saw what/who i tripped over. It was the little kid and he hit his head really hard on the hard wood floor and was crying. I went over to see if it was okay and there were no blood or anything so it didnt look bad, but after some ice pack and a few hours later he was still crying. The adults finally decided it was probably more serious than it was and took him to a near by hospital. I felt super bad and being stupid teenagers some of my friends joked around that i had killed him to try to uplift the seriousness. 3 days later i had found out he had a birth defect in his head where the blood vessels were very fragile in his head area and the impact has cause all of them to rupture and bleed out, killing him. \n\nI had blamed myself for that incident for almost 10 year, having to see the boy's parents and sister at church every sunday as a constant reminder of what i had done. I was always so sure and so scared that they blamed me very day they saw me. A few years ago i finally got the courage (with a little help from some booze) to ask the sister about finally and actually tell them that i was really sorry. And she looked at me like i was crazy and that they had never once blamed me and that it was an accident. I cried it was like a boulder was finally lifted off my shoulders, it really helped with getting out of a lot of spiraling depressions i commonly fell into.\n\n\nI've since moved on and have my life fairly well put together. and no i never went to therapy for it, although in hindsight i should have, but my mother being the conservative christian that she is never believed in psychological therapy. But shes totally okay with physical doctor and medicine stuff. I dont understand her logic either. ",

    "body": "I still blame myself for the death of my older brother. (He was the oldest). He got into bad stuff as a teenager and bad friends. I was only in middle school. He had mental health problems from my uncle, from getting some girls (including my sister) to think it was cool to drink and party and stuff. He went on for years. I always thought it would work itself out. He even broke out of a mental hospital, breaking his hand on another patient and somehow getting the bars of the window or opening the window or something, jumping out of the window (it was not the first floor) and injuring his leg. He hitchhiked from Texas to Florida and then to Cali or something and then back to Texas. I always feel guilty for not seeing it. He seemed to be getting better. Then the day after my birthday he jumped off the dam. With broken legs he swam away from rescue boats. Some woman was there that day, when he jumped, but she refused to talk to us. When we were closer and younger, I would tell on them for anything and everything. I didn't see it coming. I always thought that if I had known, maybe I could have done something. I could have helped. I could have supported him. I should have. Done something. Anything. It should have been me, he used to show me all the designs he had made for guns, this and that, he was smart. But after all the drugs, he said he had screwed up his brain and couldn't think anymore. He was scared he wouldn't pass the GED test. The day after he died, it came in the mail. He passed. He was physically strong, agile. Like double backflips off the roof onto the trampoline and landing it perfectly. I just should have seen something, done something. And now, because I couldn't, didn't, he's gone. Empty place at the table. One less person during the holidays. Sometimes I even forget his face. And it kills me. I never want to be the observer of someone's pain ever again. I don't leave people to sit alone. I don't let people go hungry. I don't let people make fun of others. They can do it to me, I can take it. But not them. Not anyone else ever again. \n\nEdit: Gold? I thank you,but I'm sure I have done or said anything worth it. Not trying to sound ungrateful,but I just don't understand why you would choose me above others. I'm honestly not sure what to say.\n",

They told me I had hit him in the face with the back his head against the concrete so hard I sent him into a seizure which ended up killing him, after testifying about what had happened and the police finding the knife on the kid they dropped any charges against me and followed through by getting me and psychiatrist and councilor to help me with the aftermath, I have to live with this everyday and it still haunts me with how beside myself I was with rage.",

    "body": "My 17 yr old rebellious nature ended up pretty much offing someone.  I was at my girlfriends house and was to be home before sundown, per parent rules.  Sun goes down at 6 or so.  Her house is 30 minutes away.  I leave at 545.  \nSpeed limit 65, im going 90. \n\nFast forward, im almost home. Maybe a mile out, and i approach a hill. Two cops are there, and one sees me and immediately starts moving.  He's gotta cross the median, so I had a little time, but i still went faster, trying to make it home because my parents would kill me if I had a ticket from being so irresponsible. \n\nThe way my home lays out, where I park, i can see the highway from it.  I made it home and saw the cop speeding by on the highway, continuing on. \n\nThe next day, news is on and i hear of a cop slamming into a sedan of a mom and her 3 kids after being in pursuit of a high speed chase yesterday.  The mom was heavily intoxicated and tried crossing the median and didn't see the cop in time. \n\nI live my life now knowing that every action you take can effect someone, even if by chance... So call the ones you love and tell them exactly what they mean to you.  Treat your interactions in public like you're dying and tomorrow is your last day.  Be courteous and humble because you never know if that guy that left the parking lot before you is going to make it home safe, even if he's an asshole.  Most importantly and hardest hitting, be completely honest with yourself and own up to every mistake.  Acknowledge it and if it really hurts you, do everything you can to make it better, constructively.  You will grow wiser and appreciate the mundane so much more, because your actions have meaning.  At least for me. ",

    "body": "This isn't exactly along the thread, but it's very close and I'd just like to say it. Cathartic, or whatever the hell that is..\n\nI wasn't the full thing that caused it. I was this guy's boss. I had recently been promoted, and was usually very relaxed. My exact words usually were \"I don't give a fuck if you're doing meth in the back, so long as you get your job done.\"\n\nWe got three new guys, a couple years younger than me. (I was around 23, these guys were 18-21.) One guy was slow as hell, one guy gave no fucks, and the third guy... I thought he was dumb or just making poor life choices. I knew he'd been trying to get into the air force, but beyond that and a girl we both knew that we both (at one point) had the hots for, we didn't have much in common.\n\nWell he'd have things go wrong in his life, like getting stuck in traffic and being two hours late. Exhaustion and therefore messing up. Poor memory and he'd have to ask me the same thing twenty times. It didn't help that he was friends with the guy who didn't give a fuck. (They'd gone out a couple times, douchebag was probably just using him as a DD though).\n\nSo I ended up being a dick to him. Nearly fired him. I was trying to get him to start doing well, cuz I liked him, but I'm not a nice person. So it probably didn't come out how I meant it at all..\n\nHe killed himself. Turns out he was supporting his family in pretty much minimum wage (8.09 at the time if I remember correctly). That's two sisters and two parents. I don't know much about the parents, but from the snippets I got, they were manipulating him and guilt tripping him into paying for their bad habits. The only reason he stayed is because of his sisters. The military was his only real chance at helping them out, since he was already working three jobs (also didn't know that), and still not making enough.\n\nI'm aware it's not my fault, entirely. But I found out a lot about him the day after he died. And I'll always know that however small the part I played was, I did not have a positive effect on him. \n\nI never really gave a fuck when people said \"you don't know what {random person} is going through.\" I'd think they're all dumbasses or assholes. Some kinda ass. Now, though, I think I get it.\n\nEdit: I'll clarify a couple points when I'm on break. But right now I'm just gonna say I was assistant manager - which changes a lot of the context of my getting on his case to my boss yelling at him and me just being the medium. Does not absolve me, but it changes things. Sorry for lack of clarity, thought this would just get glanced over and ignored.\n\nEdit 2: as I said, I was the assistant. Which meant outside of a write up, I had no power. Union store, so write up means nothing, really. I was mainly a conduit for my boss' anger. \n\nI'm not nice in that I don't go out of my way to be nice and friendly. Poker face, honest opinions, and will call people out on shit. A lot of people do not like that, even when they say they do.\n\nHow I was a dick example: one time he was two hours late. This is in a kitchen retail blend; so not really acceptable. Why he was late - he was filling out paperwork for the air force. There was an accident. He got stuck in stop and go traffic. Understandable, but still bad. Since he called the store and talked to middle management, I had no choice but to really get on his case. He'd also show up late because he worked graves at the airport (I did not know this at the time) and was getting what sleep he could. This also made him slower and more forgetful. I did try to be positive at times (asking him what he thinks he should do and encouraging him to problem solve), but I'll admit that I was short tempered a lot because I got stuck with the role of managing three new people and everything that went wrong (there's always something, with my boss) fell directly on me. \n\nWhy I didn't know these things: I did talk to him, when we had time. But he didn't open up much about his life. And he was only there a few months max (I can't actually remember how long (yes I feel like a jerk because of that)), and even the co-worker he was friends with had no clue about how stressful his life was.\n\nWould say more, but out of time.\n\nEdit 3: got a couple minutes to say this. No, I don't want sympathy. I fucked up, and to tragic effect. Actually expected to see -1k, because I'm completely aware I handled things poorly. No, I'm not a manager of any sort anymore. I didn't want to be in the first place. I was just the most qualified and needed the money, and we had to have an assistant. I left a few months later, came back, and do not intend to move up again. \n\nWork place info: dominated by older women who are.. I don't really know how to put it kindly, they're very irritable and constantly have something angry/negative to say about everyone. If I don't hear a ten minute story about something sometime did that was \"completely idiotic, do they have any brain cells left!?\" It's a good day. That's why I always tried to be the relaxed one, but even I had to crack down sometimes. ",

That way I don't hope a driver will be paying full attention and will avoid me, or slow for me or whatever - just do your shit and drive your car and I'll take responsibility for myself. \n\nI've ended up in a brief argument or two with people who get offended that I don't want to ignore the movement of other cars and just cross the road because they decide it's time for me to cross. Or upset that I don't want to step in to an intersection where a car has stopped at a fucking roundabout so a pedestrian can cross (why is it always old people who do this?). Thanks, but I'd rather not get killed today as I have shit I need to do tomorrow. Really appreciate the kind gesture though \n\nA couple of weeks ago I'm waiting for a car to drive past so I can cross behind. Yeah, I can spare another 5 seconds of my life waiting instead of sprinting across. He stops and waves me across. I give a polite smile and mouthe 'no thanks' and wave him off. He motions again with his hand, but more exaggerated movements like I was unsure of what the first wave meant. I do the same with my 'no' wave, shake my head and mime 'no'. If this was street charades I would definitely be winning. He looks fucking annoyed now, gives the horn a very quick beep, and mouthes 'GO', waving me on yet again, hurriedly because cars are now approaching behind. The fact that he looked so annoyed and was now rushing me to cross pissed me off and pointed in the direction he was facing and said \"drive your fucking car!\". Then someone honked from behind because why the fuck is this car stopped in the middle of the road playing charades with a guy on the street. Then he flipped me the bird and floored it out of there.
