They're under the same branch (enrollment mgmt) so we had to go to a lot of the same events/seminars.  \n\nAt one point, we learned that some students don't realize that financial aid is a possibility for them. Students coming from difficult backgrounds at huge schools with maybe one guidance counselor per 100+ students don't get the help they need when applying. I definitely understand that a student might not see the point in telling the difficult story of their lives, but it can really help your chances. In many ways, all we have to go on to learn about you is that essay. If you've got average grades, no extracurriculars, and you write a generic essay about how you've always wanted to be in such-and-such career, you're less likely to be noticed.  \n\nDon't be afraid to personalize your application. If you let the admissions team know that you were working two jobs after school to help your family pay rent, that really says a lot about you. We can read between the lines and see that's why your application may not be stellar in other areas.  \n\nAs a former billing counselor, I want to throw in some extra things here.  \n\n1. Don't be afraid to apply to your dream school just because you can't afford it. They may be able to give you more help than you realize.  \n2. That said, if you do get into your dream school, but the financial stars aren't aligning, really weigh your options before you take on that extra debt. You can transfer in from another school to save money (my college even specifically partnered with another and gave those students transfer aid [which typically wasn't a \"thing\"]). Really research your options. Some colleges (like mine, a private school) won't give aid to transfers, only those coming in as freshman. BUT, that could still mean savings in the end. Others are fine with transfer aid. And it's okay to ask them about it.  \n\nA DEGREE IS WHAT YOU MAKE IT. I wish that I could have said this to every student and parent who cried to me that Private College I Worked At was their DREAM SCHOOL, and can't we *please* give them more financial aid?? (Edit: to be clear, I'm not mocking them. It was heartbreaking.) We didn't have more aid to give. Please, think about your future. On more than one occasion, I witnessed a student turning down a large scholarship to another college for little to no aid from us because DREAM SCHOOL. I couldn't tell them not to do that, so I'm telling you. PLEASE. A degree is what you make it.  Look at your other options.",

    "body": "I have worked in admissions for the last ten years for graduate programs at a tier 1 US university so I actually feel qualified to answer this. There are variations in requirements dependent on program and school, but the general ones are:\n\n*1. Application form\n*2. Resume/CV\n*3. Transcripts\n*4. Letter(s) of Recommendation\n*5. Letter of Intent\n*6. Topic Essay(Possibly)\n*7. Application fee\n\nTo address each of these independently, I will lay it all out.\n\n*1. Application form - This is usually very basic, but people make very stupid mistakes with it that can have serious implications down the road. Do not use an email address that you use with friends. Thinking that MLPlover69@whatever will not be noticed or recognized as a My Little Pony enthusiast is naive. If necessary, create a very PC new one for your application. Unique ones can be a bonus though, I recall one that used the pre-chosen letters for the last round of Wheel of Fortune as being recognized favourably by faculty for example. Ensure that all answers are correct. Many times people ticked the box for \"Are you using active duty military tuition assistance to fund your education?\" when they were actually using their GI Bill. This makes a big difference as you would be handled by separate departments. While these things will not determine the outcome of your application, they speak a lot to your ability to follow directions.\n\n*2. A standard resume is fine, but make sure to have someone check it over first. I have seen so many unique mistakes on these, from a handwritten one, that appeared to be in crayon, to someone who misspelled \"bacheler\" degree with a 4.0 GPA, to ones missing dates of employment, contact information, and those that didn't change their objective from the last time they were looking for \"any job I can get, honestly I'm desperate\". Again the resume is usually not make or break, but attention to detail is important. One faculty member I worked closely with had a pet peeve about people who did not include their address on it and assumed they were homeless.\n\n*3. Some schools will only require the transcript from the school you graduated from, others(usually more prestigious schools), will want all of them. Any transfer credits, military credits, post-graduate work, certificates, community colleges, you name it. Be ready for this as some people do balk at it if they have attended multiple institutions. They usually need to be official, which means they must come directly from the school you attended to ours. I cannot stress enough to ensure you are having them sent to the correct address as well. Going online and finding a random address will likely mean they get sent to someone who has no idea who you are and tracking these down is a major issue as most universities are HUGE. Do not have them sent to yourself first and send them all together as some will still consider these unofficial and schools sometimes mark them as \"Sent to student.\".\n\n*4. In my experience letters of recommendation hold less weight than people assume. With that said, this is an area where I have seen some of the biggest mistakes. I have seen letters saying not to accept someone because they were about to be fired, those from little brothers(again written in crayon), and those from employees of the applicant. It is assumed that anyone can get people to write nice things about them, but those with the most impact are, in order, academic references, supervisors, or those in the public eye. In other words, those that actually are staking their reputation on you in a way. Anyone who is simply a colleague(except in exceptional circumstances), an underling, friend, Pastor/Rabbi/Clergyman(Perhaps different at religious schools), family member(even if they are relevant/famous) does not matter one bit and will actually harm your chances. Make sure the reference is on letterhead and includes contact information.  \n\n*5. Different schools and programs will have unique instructions, but the most common is \"Why you want to get in, why you have chosen to apply to this program in particular, and what you hope to accomplish after completing the degree.\" My number one recommendation is that you follow all instructions implicitly. Consider this your first assignment, spelling, grammar, passion, and content are all equally scrutinized. This part is why it is important to actually speak to someone familiar with the admissions committee if at all possible as they can provide unique insight into what they look for, as it will change by program and department, even within the same university. I know of one faculty member who pretty much automatically accepted anyone who said that they were the first in their family to pursue higher education, regardless of previous academic performance. This is the make or break part. It gives you a chance to explain that you drank your way through first year ten years ago, yet your professional career since speaks volumes about who you are. Perhaps you lost a family member while studying, you had to work three jobs as no one was supporting you, or any other hardships you overcame. The most important part is that you overcame whatever it was. You need to demonstrate that you are a capable individual that needs or wants this degree for a specific reason. The people reading these generally want to let you in, but they don't want to set people up for failure. GPA requirement is usually not a hard cut-off, everyone is looked at holistically, so don't be afraid to apply to a program that you may not qualify for on paper if you are truly passionate about it.\n\n*6. If a topic essay is required, my only instruction is that you follow the directions to the letter and have multiple, QUALIFIED,  people look it over. Again, dependent on program, this is your first assignment and is make or break.\n\n*7. Most will have an application fee associated with it, however this can sometimes be waived under certain circumstances. It is not a bad idea to ask, but don't be disappointed if it can't. It is usually a lot of paperwork on the school's side to make this happen, but if those you speak with feel for you they want to do it. Again, a lot of times they simply can't so don't push the issue. With that said, don't let a fee that is truly an investment in yourself stop you for applying to even a school you don't think you can get into.\n\nIn conclusion, take the entire process seriously, I've seen too many people who either half-ass it, assume they are entitled to it for whatever reason, or otherwise don't give it the care it deserves. I have seen people with multiple doctorates rejected for a master's program so nothing is guaranteed. Put your best work and attention into it and more times than not you will be accepted.",

    "body": "Never write about the school you're applying to.  Write about yourself.  Who are you, what do you have to offer, what motivates you, who will you be one day?\n\nThere's a story that the folks down at Rice tell when they're doing tours.  Their application has a little box in the middle of a page, with the instructions to fill the box with something unique that expresses why they should accept you.  Back in the 80s, some kid filled the box with glue and then dumped uncooked rice on it, so that there was just a rectangle of dry rice in the middle of the app.  They tell everyone this so that they know it has been done, and will result in your application being rejected immediately.\n\nSeriously.  The admissions people anywhere see a dozen apps a day that talk about how good the school is, or its history, or its alumni, etc.  They've seen all of it before, and none of that means a damn thing when it comes to what *you* will bring to the school.\n\nThe objective of your average admissions department is to find students who will do two things: finish at least one degree, and become rich so they give back to the school someday in the future.  If you can convince your admissions officer that you're not going to drop out, and that you're going to make good use of your degree, they're going to want to bring you in.\n\nThe first part is mostly a function of your grades and test scores.  If your stats look good, it's a fair bet that you'll finish your degree.  If you're worried about how your stats look, use the essay to explain that you faced some hardship, or convey an anecdote about how hard you worked on a project (be specific - explain what you were trying to do, what made it hard, how you eventually made it work, *and how it felt to complete it*).\n\nThe second one is where the essay really comes in.  Unless you just wrote your essay about a hardship or hard work, then you want to write either about your love of a given subject, or about your dreams for the future and how you plan to achieve them using your degree in a given subject.\n\nIf you really enjoy history, write an essay about what makes history so interesting to you, and explain your favorite obscure story about your favorite historical event.  As an example: the assassination of Franz Ferdinand is almost glossed over in most textbooks as an event that directly led to the first world war, but the [actual story](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyCmh9G1fpo) of Young Bosnia's attempts to kill him, and Gavrilo Princip's eventual success, is one of the most interesting things about the war.  You only have about two pages, so you'd have to very carefully summarize, but there's not much better way to explain how a subject like history gets more interesting the deeper you dig into it.\n\nEdit: Thanks for the gold, kind stranger.

    "body": "I read and evaluated applications for the University of Chicago and now, for the last ~6 years, have helped ~300 students apply to college as an admissions consultant, using the insight I gained within a top-5 admissions office.\n\n- I see so many students leave off extracurricular activities because they worry they're not prestigious enough. They leave off hobbies as they didn't realize the 10 hours a week they spent on independent art projects could count as an extracurricular. They don't mention their family obligations, such as having to take care of their 4 younger siblings for many hours each day as their single mom works two jobs. For more insight on what might count on your college app, [see my post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/6eg8jq/what_you_should_do_if_you_have_no_extracurricular/).\n\n- They underestimate hours spent on an extracurricular activity. While it is obviously bad to lie/exaggerate your hours, it's not good to underestimate them, either! Last year I worked with an Olympic athlete on her applications. In looking at her original list of extracurricular activities, she had included 15 hours/week as an estimate for her commitment to her sport. I was surprised to hear how low of a time commitment that was, and she remarked \"Oh, well, my mom and I have to travel, like, 4 hours roundtrip every day just to get to practice.\" 4 HOURS EACH DAY!? Add that significant travel time to your activities list, girl! If you, too, have an activity that requires travel time, you **can** include that time in your estimated hours/week time commitment on your applications. [Check out my guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/6lx32y/how_to_write_your_common_app_and_uc_activities/) to the activities list for more tips like this.\n\n- They get generic letters of recommendation, or they pick a teacher that doesn't add a lot of value to their application. Most top universities want two letters of recommendation from teachers: one from a STEM teacher and one from humanities. Ideally, these teachers are from a student's junior year or had the student for multiple classes/years at school. Further, many teachers use a template to write their letters of recommendation so most letters of rec are very generic. They include stuff like \"she was a good class contributor\" or \"he will excel in college\" without any concrete details as to why\u2014as most teachers are **not** paid to write letters of rec, must write a lot of them, and take shortcuts to churn out letters in time for the deadline. To get good letters of recommendation, it is key that your teacher personalizes the letter. Ideally, they'll also compare you to your peers. For example, \"He is the single most driven student I have met in my 10 year career, and he is absolutely determined to accomplish his dreams of XYZ\" or \"She is the brightest math student I teach across all my 7 classes this year,\" etc. How to get those sort of letters of rec? Send them a letter with detailed examples and anecdotes from your time in class! You can download my [guide to getting good letters of rec](http://www.helpwithapps.com/store/p9/lettersofrec) for more tips.\n\n- Their essays are generic, too, because they fail to include how they think, feel, or view the world differently as a result of their experiences. I cannot tell you how many students' essays I've read that talk about football or piano or their research position and just gives an A to Z guide of their participation in the activity. Do you know how many other students have done the same activities? These essays all blend together and tell us little about YOU other than what we could have already gleaned from your activities list. One of my favorite essays from recent years started as just an essay about the student's participation in orchestra. After a lot of 1-on-1 brainstorming and revisions, the student wrote an excellent essay starting with really cool imagery about the origami artwork hanging from her bedroom ceiling before transitioning into her hobbies. She wrote something like, \"Just as distinctly different are the [origami shape 1] and [origami shape 2] hanging above my head are my passions for [activity 1] and [music]\u2014but they both hang in my heart.\" It was more well-written than that, but I'm pulling from the dregs of my memory. The essay turned out awesome, was super reflective of how the student thought, felt, or viewed the world differently as a result of her experiences and interests, and she's currently at an Ivy League university\u2014in part because she wrote an essay at the Ivy League level.\n\n- Many universities (UChicago, Penn, Michigan, Columbia, Brown, Yale, Stanford, Cornell, Carnegie Mellon, etc.) ask \"Why our college?\" or a combo between \"Why our college?\" and \"Why your major?\" BE SPECIFIC. I cannot tell you how many essays I read for UChicago that were like \"When I visited your campus, it felt magical. I was surrounded by students who were so driven yet friendly. As I explored your biology major, I found great classes like organic chemistry and intro to biology, and I just knew that such a prestigious university would prepare me for medical school.\" BLAH BLAH BLAH\u2014all this could apply to **any** school! Be extremely, extremely specific. Research the school extensively. Find classes that the university offers that you haven't seen at any other school (o-chem doesn't cut it). Mention the curriculum (Core at UChicago or Columbia, Open Curriculum at Brown, for example), and don't just say you like it\u2014really dig into WHY that curriculum exists from a fundamental educational level and what sort of catalyst it will be for your own thinking. Search the school's online newspaper for some cool programs that other prospective students might not know about, talk to current students/alumni (if possible) and incorporate things that you learned. Ask them what underlying qualities the student body possesses (for UChicago, it's a thirst for knowledge, and at Georgetown, it might be some Jesuit value), and evidence your possession of those very same characteristics in your essay. Mention specific professors under whom you wish to study/research, and connect their classes/research back to your own intellectual interests. Better yet, email the professor, have an awesome conversation with them, and incorporate some element of that conversation in your essay. Don't think professors will give you the time of day? This strategy has worked for my 1-on-1 students at Stanford, UChicago, Yale, Princeton, Penn, and many more schools. You can [download my guide to emailing professors here](http://www.helpwithapps.com/store/p6/emailprofessors). Bottom line: If the essay can be copied and pasted to fit any other university, **be more specific**.\n\nIf you have any questions, I'm all ears.

    "body": "I sometimes read scholarship applications for my alma mater.  Not admissions applications, per se, but I think this still applies.\n\nMany students don't take it seriously.  I was definitely one of those when I was applying for school.  *UGH, 5 essays?  Well, I guess they get one about how much I hate writing essays...*  Those kids are immediately disqualified.  People who need the money will take it seriously, and if you need the money and didn't take it seriously, well, you're an idiot and I probably don't want you coming to my school anyway.\n\nThe second thing people do is share things they absolutely should not be sharing.  *Let me tell you about how my friends and I do meth every day in gym class...*  Even if I wanted to give you the scholarship, I can't now, because \"Meth addict gets full ride to X school by bragging about being a meth addict\" is bad press for the school.  Just don't write about your criminal activity, okay?  The vast majority of those are things like \"I think drugs should be legal because I smoke all the time.\"  But there are a few like \"I killed a kid and no one knows.\"  WHAT.  THE.  FUCK?  I had to call the cops on that guy, which was definitely not how I wanted to spend my afternoon.\n\nThe last bit of overshare is people talking about how they aren't inspired and don't try hard at their school.  Again, you're an idiot.  Why would you tell a school that you don't want to be in school?  Why would you tell a school that you don't like school?  Why would you tell a school that you think school is stupid?  You are the stupid one in this scenario.\n\nOn to what people forget to mention: There's probably a ton of stuff here.  Most of the time people only talk about the *right now* stuff in their life.  \"Describe how you overcame adversity\" prompts a kid to write about how in English class he had to read three books in two weeks.  This is a shitty essay about you being a bad student.  Later in his application, I see the kid's photo and lo:  the kid is a double-amputee.  WRITE ABOUT THAT YOU IDIOT.  The more \"finished\" an adverse situation is in your mind, the more you no longer dwell on it, the better that is an example of how you OVERCAME the adversity.  That kid...  he just chose the most mundane and boring essay topics across the board, and he absolutely could have won the scholarship if he'd just written about his actual life.\n\nOthers will say this, but use spellcheck.  Write a real essay with paragraphs and not a giant block of text.  Know the difference between there, their, and they're.  Know the difference between your and you're.  Know the difference between peek and peak.  Holy shit kids, it's fucking college.  Maybe know your third grade vocabulary.\n\nLook, you should find an adult and talk to them about your essays.  Have them ask you the essay questions, and just talk to them like a normal human about your answers.  When you land on a story that seems compelling and you can talk at length about, bam, there's your essay.  Unless it's about how you're a felon who hates school.\n\nI have to give this money to someone, right?  SOMEONE is going to get this scholarship.  Make my job easy, please, and just omit all the horrible things you've done in your life.  Write the essay as if you're trying to convince someone that you need some money to make your life a little easier because, well, your life has been hard up to this point.\n\nHere are a few examples of people who got the scholarship:\n\n- Russian girl who fled ethnic violence in Russia to the USA, had to learn english on her own (in 5th grade) because her parents didn't speak it at all, and is now trying to major in physics.\n\n- Forty year old man who dropped out of high school to join the army and became a paratrooper.  When he got back to the USA he became a firefighter and then a smoke jumper.  He now wants to teach music.  I love this guy.\n\n- A black kid who grew up in white suburbs.  His essays were fascinating.  They were all about how everyone assumes that because he is a black kid growing up in white suburbs he's had a life full of racism, but he doesn't feel that way at all.  Rather, he feels apart from the black community and so he wants to be an african american studies major in order to learn about himself.  He needed the money because his parents had been spending every cent just to raise him in a good neighborhood and they couldn't afford college.\n\nIf anyone here has questions about their essay topics, I'll try to give you pointers.",

It\u2019s normally the first thing universities look at. I recommend someone who will write passionately but honestly about you. It can sometimes be helpful to send your writer your resume and essay submissions as well (and if they\u2019re willing to look at and incorporate those documents, they\u2019re probably a good writer for you). \n\nAlso, self-advocacy is key for your essay submissions, so don\u2019t be afraid of coming off as bragging.

    "body": "Alright so I went to a university, private catholic college, very fucking expensive. I took a work study in admissions, and I handled putting in transcripts, letters, ACT/SAT, etc, etc. \n\nThe number one thing that kids like to just wimp out on is recommendations. They saved so many asses when it came to kids being accepted.  For example:\n\nKid 1 - has a 2.6 GPA, 21 ACT, has a great recommendation from a teacher who explains their struggles or their constant growth, anything flattering that isn't too over the top.\n\nKid 2 - has a 2.9 GPA, 23 ACT, has a generic recommendation sheet from a counselor, usually just a blank sheet with someone basic info, only a simple recommendation signature from a counselor. \n\nYou would not believe how many times the school would pick kid 1. Having a personal educator saved them and got them admitted over someone slightly better in terms of academics. Character is looked at a lot by universities. \n\nFun story, a kid got denied because he didn't get a recommendation letter, he sent a letter in that was like... pornographic in nature, smutty and just gross. I didn't get to read it sadly, poor girl was the one who got it, he had to come and apologize face to face to everyone, even though he lived like 400 miles away. His mom knew he wouldn't get reconsidered even if he apologized, she just wanted to make him eat shit for it. I have a lot of other stories about crazy admissions haha",

I think it's important as these are valuable attributes to have when attending university and being away from home for the first time.

It's post grad so some things may be different but the competitiveness is there with a sub 10% acceptance rate. \n\nSo here is something you may not want to hear but it's the truth: your grades and test scores are going to be most important to most schools. There is a lot of talk on here about setting yourself apart. The first way you do that is by showing you can actually do the work. No competitive admissions department is going to accept you, no matter how many lunches you served to the homeless, if they don't believe you can do the work. It's not something you can show in the 2 weeks you are working on your app if you haven't worked on it for the 4 years prior. \n\nStudents with the stick-to-it factor look much better than those who make a 4.0 some semesters and 2.8 others. Your GPA might average out to a 3.5 but you are going to be scrutinized much harder than a student that just makes a steady 3.5 yearly. Consistency is key. If you did poorly early on make sure to consistently increase your grades while also taking difficult courses. \n\nNow how do you set yourself apart from the others that look good.  For med school admissions we like to interview but for those that don't have that option, essays are your way of letting you tell the school \"why me.\" The poster that talked about selling a used car a few posts earlier, your analogy doesn't apply to competitive admissions. You better let us know why you want to come to our school. It is on you to convince me why you want this position because there are literally ten others in a line waiting to have the shot you are getting. \n\nIn your essay make sure to tailor the reasoning to each school. Each one is different. Some are research focused and some are mission based. Make sure your reasoning for attending the school is laid out. Try to talk as little as possible about other people. I've read essays that talk about all the great things someone's parent did but gloss over what the applicant does. Then on the other side there is the applicant that looks full of themselves. I'm not saying don't brag, in fact do it like your looking for a job, but make sure you aren't over zealous and are realistic with your goals. (This next part applies to the 90% of schools that aren't Ivy League or STEM heavy) I see applicants who say they are going to change the world. Odds are you won't, and what then. Will you drop out when you see you can't cure cancer after 2 years of undergrad or med school. What is a realistic plan that will work if you stick to it. Thinking you will solve a problem on your own when there are literally tens of thousands of people working on the same issue is unrealistic and will sometime cause us to pass on an app. If your applying to MIT or Berkeley and you make these claims you better already have 2 years of research under your belt that is showing promising results. \n\nIt's not easy but we try to be as fair as possible and let those that deserve the position most from their hard work and results have the seat. To this day it still bothers me when I have to send rejection letters and that \"I regret to inform you\" line is true.\n\nBottom line, make sure your app lines up with the school. Don't think so much that this is a job you are applying to as much as a dating profile. We want to see you, your personality, what your future earning potential might be, how committed to us and yourself you are, and most importantly if you are a good fit. \n\n*Writing this from a phone in bed so please look over the typos.

The wait list comes with an invitation to \"update your application\" with new material, but most kids check the \"Yes, wait list me\" box and don't bother to add any updates. \n\nI studied hard my last semester and got my best grades ever, took more AP tests. I continued with my extracurricular activities, advanced to a higher-level belt level in taekwondo, kept volunteering at the hospital, got an extra teacher's recommendation letter, wrote an extra essay, and I sent all that in to the school in May. \n\nIn July, I was sent a letter from First Choice College, which gave me the option to remain on a \"summer wait list.\" I have never heard of this before (and haven't heard of it since), but I figured, what's the harm? I sent the form back with a Yes, and meanwhile I registered at my second-choice school and prepared to attend there the last week of August.\n\nIn mid-August, as I was almost ready to head off to college for orientation, I was researching transfer options and looked up First Choice School online. I saw that they offered transfer applications, but they weren't on the site yet. So I sent in a basic email to the admissions office asking, \"When will your transfer applications be available for the upcoming year?\"\n\nI kid you not, THE NEXT MORNING I got a call from Admissions, who said, \"We got your transfer request, but actually, a spot just opened up for the fall. Do you want to take it?\" I was so shocked that I almost couldn't answer her, but I told her emphatically yes. They Fedexed my information, I withdrew from Second Choice School, and ten days later, I was on a plane to First Choice College, where I graduated 4 years later.\n\nWhile at that college, I worked at admissions and got to know the deans well. Almost assuredly, my extra efforts were what gained me entry. Apparently a girl had gotten into a car accident two weeks before orientation, and they were going to leave the slot empty, but I just happened to pop up. They saw that I was on the wait list, that I'd updated my application, and with the transfer question, I clearly really wanted to go to their school. So I got in.",

They look at test-optionals last, so if they've already gotten close to their admissions quota, they will be much more scrupulous, and it'll be harder to get in. Their logic is that if you don't submit your test scores, you either don't test well, or \"aren't smart enough\" for the university, which is unfortunate. \n\nSo if you want to submit test-optional to a certain large university in Delaware, please please PLEASE only do it if you've got a great GPA, a large amount of extra-curriculars, and recommendations from teachers/administrators. Even mediocre test scores are better than no test scores, it seems. \n\n",

    "body": "Late to the party, but here's my experience as a sixth form personal tutor at a prestigious UK college. \n\nIgnore a lot of stuff here from American sources. Yes, your extracurricular activities and part time job can be important, but only if they're relevant to the actual course. Nobody at a uni gives a toss that you had a paper round at 14, and there's not much about playing football every now and then that's actually relevant to many courses. That said, if you're applying for Dentistry and you've got level 8 piano, for god's sake, show off your manual dexterity. \n\nTo link to the above point, think about what skills are genuinely useful for your course, then think about what you've done either within or outside your studies that fits them. I had a student who ran a very successful baking business by himself and didn't think to mention it as he was applying for Law. Yet he'd had to go through all the legal documentation to set up that business, and that made him stand out.\n\nNobody likes sob stories, but if you missed three months during year 11 because you were in hospital and still got great grades, tell them that. It makes you much more remarkable than other students who've had it easy. It's a fine line to tread to avoid sounding self-pitying, but I've had students who were young carers, who'd dealt with serious illnesses of their own or with the losses of loved ones during important periods of their lives and come through their experiences standing tall. Resilience and tenacity are important qualities for a student, and not easily come by, so if you've done well despite the odds, show them that.\n\nEven if there's one uni in particular that you want to go to, remember that you're probably going to apply for five, so don't go into detail about sections of the course from one specific university. The others will pick up on it and know they won't be your first choice, so they're going to choose someone else. Put in details about things you want to study that are in **all** the courses you're applying for. It's difficult and takes careful research, but it can help.\n\nThink about what makes you unique. Admissions tutors read hundreds of applications - I used to ask my group to put their hands up if they were a prefect in school, and usually at least two thirds of the group would put their hands up. It won't make you stand out. I did the same with part time jobs and/or work experience. Again, loads put their hands up. Then I asked them to keep their hands up if their job or work experience was actually relevant to their chosen course. Only a few were ever left with their hands up. They're the people who stick out - the ones who've gone to some effort to do something that will actually help them.\n\nFinally, and most importantly, be passionate. They want to know you're fully committed to spending three years studying this one subject. You must really love it to be contemplating spending all that time and money studying it, so show them that. Don't be afraid to look like a subject nerd. They want subject nerds. Tell them **exactly** why you've enjoyed studying specific topics and link to what you'd be doing at uni, if possible. Tell them the extra reading you've done, mentioning specific books, or the specific exhibitions you've been to. If you've got a specific career aspiration that the course will lead to, tell them that, but be specific about **why** you want to do it. Most important though: show don't tell. For the love of everything that is holy, show that you're passionate, but don't bloody say \"I am passionate...\" You'll go straight on the no pile.",

Honestly, a lot of what I see could be fixed with more time and care on the application. We'd get calls from students asking, 'This says I need Freshman Comp, does Tech Writing count?' Look, go you for asking, but if it says Freshman Comp, that's what's needed and yeah, you might need to go back and take another class. If you need three letters of rec, provide THREE. If one needs to be from a boss, don't get it from a professor. Start your application early enough that you're not rushing it at the deadline and turning in a mediocre application; you're not helping yourself by getting in a hurry and missing things you'd have caught otherwise. If you're too late this cycle to carefully complete the application, WAIT. Get in on the next cycle, and work or volunteer in/near your field while you do that. We remember who turned in a sloppy, half-done application package last cycle, and it will absolutely set you back a little on the next. Not a lot, but if you're trying for a spot in a prestigious program, it might be just enough t keep you out.\n\nFinally, and this is important: I don't care if you have to get a restraining order or something, DO NOT let your parents call the university about ANYTHING to do with your application. It's not about them, you're a fucking grownup and it's your job to deal with the admissions office, ask questions if you're stuck, and meet the appropriate deadlines.

The greatest narcissist can write about humility, the least interested in becoming an expert in the field can make themselves seem the most interested, and so on.  What I look for in a personal statement is really to put your objective short comings in perspective. In other words, somewhat lower scores in the context of frequently volunteering in free clinics and being overall engaged in something other than studying allows me to have some confidence that they can study to the point of expertise all while working 80 hours a week and studying hours on top of that. Also any issues in the application absolutely need to be addressed here (failed class, bad board exam score, etc) or the worst will be assumed.  Finally, the other thing I look for in a personal statement is something (anything!) to talk to you about on the interview. Something that makes you...not unique...but well rounded and human.  \n\nThe college application process seems to focus to heavily on whether you play a fossilized ancient Japanese harp last played 500 years ago and less on what really matters: work ethic, ability, and emotional maturity.

I did international (including U.S.) admissions for about 15 years. \nMake sure your guidance office includes details about your school! It's usually a brochure outlining details of the school and student population--accreditation, numbers of students in honours, AP, etc. Without this information, we don't have a way to gauge the quality of your school. \nIn regards to the personal statement/letters of recommendation/resume, to be honest, we rarely ever looked at them. If you had the required SAT/ACT scores, attended an academic high school and had the required grades in honours courses, we would make you an offer. FYI -- most Ontario Universities (with the exception of a few niche programs) don't require this type of information from Ontario applicants. While I can't speak for all Ontario Universities, I know that in discussing U.S. admissions policy with my colleagues from other universities, most of them didn't consider them either (if you are applying to an Ontario school, be sure to double-check this with their Admissions Office).\nAs an aside, I frequently met with prospective US students and their families. I cannot tell you how many times they were visibly relieved when we told them that we rarely considered personal statements/letters of recommendation/resumes -- the exception would be for students who were academically borderline, or had some significant family/health issues that affected their studies.\nThere are a lot of academically very strong students whose primary reason for going to university is to learn. While we would encourage them to get involved in campus activities, they were also free to choose not to, and we were fine with that.\n",

    "body": "Used to be an undergraduate member of my university's scholarship committee, which used admissions applications to award high tier (full-ride/full tuition) scholarships.\n\nWhat most annoyed me and my other committee members (including faculty) were mundane, cookie cutter essay question responses. \n\nAside from your essay question responses, almost everything in your application is already decided: your GPA, your extra curriculars, your AP coursework. The essay questions are where you can still make a difference and set yourself apart.\n\nI can say, honestly, that essays make or break an applicant. I've seen students with near perfect SAT scores get low scholarship amounts because of bland essays, and students with average/unspectacular test scores receive full rides because they put an extra day into their essays and really made themselves stand out.\n\nSo how do you do that? Be creative. Begin with a story, use first person, and share something about yourself that is unique. \n\nSay the prompt asks you to describe why you would like to pursue your current program, and you're planning to be a pre-med student. Don't talk about how you've always wanted to be a doctor since you were little (I swear, like 80% of entering undergrads have wanted to be doctors since they were seven years old). Instead, talk about the time your grandmother was diagnosed with late stage pancreatic cancer, and even though your family was heartbroken, the oncologist sat with you and took the time to answer all your questions while remaining frank and honest, but also empathetic toward what you all faced. Talk about how the integrity of this doctor inspired you to help and heal as many people as she does.\n\nIf the prompt asks you to talk about something you've done in high school that you're proud of, DON'T mention your 4.0 or taking AP courses or that you're in Honor's Society. No one cares, because almost all the applications the readers receive will list these experiences. Most scholarship committees are only given the best applications to review anyway (the unqualified apps are filtered out by admissions based on test scores/gpa), and if my experience was typical, each reviewer reads 20-30 (or more) at a time. Cookie cutter responses like these melt together and don't stand out. Instead, talk about one moment in your high school career that defined you and shaped your attitude or self-discipline: practicing an extra hour a night for all state orchestra, winning your state's robotics competition, etc. If possible talk about growth moments where you took action to become a better student/person. Faculty members love dynamic mindsets.\n\nBe creative, genuine, and don't worry about saying what you think the reviewers want to hear (that's what everyone else is doing). Instead, think outside of the box on the prompt and tell a story.\n",

It's not a good idea. I know church might mean a lot to you, but there are a few issues with it:\n\n1) Students writing about their identity through the lens of being a church member often fail to convey anything meaningful about themselves. These papers often conclude in some way about God's power, without really diving into your own accomplishments or personal agency.\n\n2) A lot of people, myself concluded, have a difficult history with the church, and your essay might leave a sour taste in their mouth. A lot of admission professionals are gay, church abuse survivors, etc., so don't risk it.\n\n3) Unless it's really humbly written, with a self-aware perspective, it will probably come off as holier-than-thou. Your editors may have a similar worldview and be blind to that tone. Usually, students are talking about how church is everything to them, or how a particular event made them a better person, and this voice can be difficult to catch.\n\nI grew up in the church and it's entirely possible this describes my personal statement from however many years ago. I really hope this doesn't come across as judgemental or condemning, because I really get it. But I think a lot of well-intentioned churchy personal statements just miss the mark.\n\nApologies for any typos, I'm just waking up and must now jump in the shower as I'm a few minutes late!

I did not make any decisions on whether to accept/debt students, but I had to process the applications once the decision was made.\n\nIt shocked me how few students could follow directions. The application was very straightforward, but we got countless applications with errors and essays and co-curricular activities list in the wrong format. This didn't necessarily eliminate a student, but it did play into the decision making process.\n\nThere were also a handful of people that hand-wrote the essay and activities list, some of which even left the side from where they ripped it out of the notebook attached. This looked unprofessional and was hard to read. I understand that not everyone has easy access to a computer, but it is important the materials submitted to college are typed and professional. \n\nLastly, I saw many students who had high test scores and grades so they put no time or effort into the essay. I understand applying to universities requires lots of essays and they get tiring to write. It is important to at least try! If you submit a crap essay it says a lot about you as a person, and admissions staff notice these things. I've seen cases where high achieving students were not accepted due to a poorly written essay. ",

    "body": "Maybe a little late to the party but I have a bit of a different perspective from the folks here who help with this professionally.\n\nI wrote a fuckton of essays to 12 schools when I applied to college. I got into all of them (sample: Duke, Georgetown, Wake Forest, other good places) and my grades were good but not valedictorian kind of level or anything. My SAT score was good but not amazing (1360 old scoring). I explain this because my essays, I believe, is what put me over the edge with lower than usual scores for students coming in with perfect 4.0s and monster SAT scores.\n\nAnyway, my advice is to first of all not constrain yourself to a box. Many of the professional essay writer helpers I notice are following a formula. Stop thinking like that. Reviewers are reading tons of essays and if they read about how everyone is so dedicated to x sport or had a single mother (not to diminish that - it's just something a lot of people will write about) they are likely to just meh out on your application.\n\nSo my advice: write to what you're good at. Don't write a funny essay if you're not a good comedy writer. Ask around, teachers, friends, etc. What they think is interesting about you or what an interesting story you may have told them that was impactful to them. I wrote mine about meeting my favorite children's book author as a kid and how he ended up being a grumpy fat bald man that was mean to me. I talked about how we put people on a pedestal without knowing them and how even at a really young age it made me think about how we deify people. It was a light comedy entertainment piece that told a story while sprinkling stuff in about myself.\n\nBe creative, think this question: in a sea of essays what is going to stand out in some way. Comedy, entertaining stories that tell something about you, sad stories, powerful stories, things that will move someone. Within that genre communicate who you are and what is important to you. Don't stick to formulas, try to break all the formulas. You're interesting and unique, make them see it.\n\nAnyway sorry for the rant, I just feel like a lot of the professional essay advisors here are good enough to get you into a great school *if you have all the grades and perfect scores*, but for those that don't your essay needs to be truly memorable. Good luck all!   ",

I don't even know if it was technically but whatever.\n\nAlso, on letters of recommendation, I'm not really close to any of my teachers so I feel it would be rude to ask them to write something special about me when we don't really know each other.\n\nNext is the essay stuff... My God am I a boring ass person. I have no ECs, I don't think I could consider anything I do a worthwhile hobby (maybe gokarting but that's just at K1 speed and maybe once every month or two. Or possibly simracing->basically video games). I get home, lay in bed, watch some livestreams/browse the internet, do homework, go to bed. I've dabbled in different hobbies but none of them stuck for longer than a week so I think those are irrelevant. \n\nMy parents were going through a divorce from when I was 13 to when I was 16 so it really impacted me and I was depressed. From 7th grade to the end of my sophomore year of high school I missed more than 20 days of school each school year. I wanted no part of school, ECs, and couldn't find a hobby to get into. I guess that could be why I'm pretty boring now.\n\nI have good grades and am top 15% of my class so I guess that's nice, that's with 2 APs, 2 PreAP, and 6 Dual Credit. 1220 on the first SAT I took and a 1290 the second time. And I'm taking the ACT in October\n\nIf the state matters, I'm in Texas and will be going to school in Texas for mechanical engineering \n\nThanks if you read this mess, I'm just worried about college and me getting there...

I don't understand social contact at all. I don't understand how I could benefit a uni.

As I told him early on \"a degree is just a filter - it keeps out 90% of the really dumb people; not having a degree puts you in the same category as the 90% who could not finish, but also the 100% who did not get a chance to try. It's just one more bullet point on the list of \"why you?\".\n\nETA - in the 90's, the general impression at my company was that Ivy league degrees and such more likely indicated connections or money, as likely as ability.

Bush and his \"gentleman's C\") Then you're applying at a job where the people across the table likely don't have that privilege and may resent that - they'll be looking for proof in that short interview that you really are the super-brilliant person your degree should indicate.

    "body": "In short? Not as much. Keep in mind, the current culture around applying for college - the idea that college is practically *mandatory* - only began about 1-2 generations ago. Part of this was fueled by the baby boomer generation coming of age by the 1970s and then it was accelerated by deindustrialization that began to wipe out high-wage blue collar work that previous generations could strive for even if only a GED-equivalent. \n\nSince then, the ratio between applicants-to-openings has increased substantially. I mean, there's a reason why predatory, for-profit colleges took off over the last generation (besides lack of regulation). \n\nIn any case, it is sobering for me to think that I probably wouldn't have gotten into my undergraduate college (Berkeley) now if I were to apply vs. when I did (1990). I had good scores, recs, etc. but the level of competition to get into any UC has skyrocketed in the 25+ years since I attended. ",

Being a human encompasses showing others what actually makes you as a person tick, showcases your passions, and highlights your faults honestly and without giving canned answers. When you've read a ton application essays and cover letters you can tell when someone is telling a story they think they should tell rather than a story that's genuine. The whole \"be yourself\" adage comes to mind. I whole heartedly admit that it sounds dumb and unhelpful, but I can't begin to tell you how many essays and cover letters I've read that are something like \"I'd like to be hired by your company because your company's motto is x and i live that every day of my life too\" or \"your schools engineering program is #x and I want to go to a top school so my job prospects are high\"  or even worse, \"in my time traveling abroad I found that other cultures are interesting and theb I came back to then give x amount of my time helping disadvantaged people.\" Those essays and letters are boring to read. Admissions consultants (people paid thousands of dollars to give you the \"right\" answers to yuouur essays... or just write your essays for you) often give you these types of responses. Tell stories that are light hearted or ones that are personal and make you vulnerable. Then tell me what that story has to do with you wanting to go to my school or get a job at my company. Be genuine and showcase your genuine, well thought out interest. \n\nBetter?",

International science research tends to be in English so this isn't exactly a surprising inflection point.\n\nAlso if you're going to look at German programs, I think it's gotten better since I was looking in 2010, but I think they'd just standardized to a normal BS/MS/PhD format from the traditional German format (trying to remember what my German STEM professor explained to me).

Even within the US system, I definitely got inferior research opportunities in my STEM major compared to going to a big university, and on paper I looked like I arguably looked like I had another year of school left in my major because of the distribution requirements meaning I was just barely going over the credit requirements to graduate with the major.

The work they want you to do in college is not harder than the work they want you to do your last year in high school. What makes college harder is that no one cares if you fail. Your teachers and even coaches in high school will bend over backwards to help you succeed - give you time to work on it in class (repeatedly), allow you to pass from work turned in stupidly late, give partial credit for any little thing, call home with reminders, talk to your other teachers about helping you pass, anything they can. College professors will not do those things. Depending on your college and class sizes, they might not even know your name. If you really want to be ready for college, I tell them, start right now today going to tutorials after school. Get used to finding your teachers on *their* time to ask for help, outside of class. Get used to telling your friends that you can't hang out because you need to study or work on a project due next month. If you really want to do well in college, make while you are still in high school that school is a priority for you on your own time, not just when it's forced upon you. \n\nEdit: Clarification",

Probably the best thing you can do for your kids isn't to send them to a tutor but to engage them from an early age. Talk to them about what they are doing at school, get them to explore what interests them further. Allow them to form ideas independently and teach them how to engage in intellectual debate where you start with an idea and as new information is presented to you or you start to understand something a little different your conclusion adapts.

I was feeling pretty good about it pretty quickly, but I knew I'd *really* nailed the interview when I had one guy who let the conversation go completely off the rails of what the interview was theoretically supposed to be about. Nothing's impossible, but generally speaking, people who haven't already decided they like you and that you're a good fit won't let the interview turn into freewheeling bullshitting.\n\nI now notice this when I do interviews myself. I try to be conscious of making sure that I ask/say certain things but overall if I start just having a normal conversation with the candidate then I've almost certainly basically just already decided that they're a good fit and don't *need* to know more. When I've stayed on-topic the entire time it was with people who gave me enough concern that I started trying to probe for whether they actually understood the position they were applying for and whether they had any amount of enthusiasm about it.",

It wasn't like it was lying but did go ahead and let them know how much it did mean to me. As you said after the fact I actually smoked a god damned brisket for them. There is back story to this as it had gotten around to them I made some great BBQ haha, but basically I let one of my professors pick any God damn neat he wanted and made so much I could feed each of their families EASILY with left overs lol. Delivered it still hot actually. (if you smoke or BBQ get yourself a good huge cooler and line it with four layers of aluminum foil and a layer of thin packed foam on the outside of that and it stays hot all day.) smoked it 14 hours over night and delivered it about 3 pm Friday when the first had to leave. Stayed around and kept the rest warm on my pack for the other two till they left about 6.just hung out and talked. Actually got my a summer job doing this. Sitting and talking to grad students and the professor while she was there, worked in her lab all summer. Boom fucking gratitude. Nothing says gratitude like smoked meat. NOTHING. It always goes with beer so you can't say a beer. ",
