The final interview was with the HR director.  It went okay and then we got to the pay part.  I said I wanted X amount.  She said the average pay for my experience and position was X - 20k.\n\nMy response was \"Bob didn't fly me out here because I'm average,\"\n\nI have no idea why I said that, but I got the job and the pay I wanted.\n\nMonths later when we were getting drinks Bob brought that up.  Apparently HR director thought I was very quiet and introverted from our interview so my response caught her even more off guard than it caught me.",

    "body": "(Reposting my story from a previous AskReddit thread)\n\nMy first vehicle was a 1985 dodge ram that had around 300k miles on it. Needless to say, it wasn't exactly reliable.\n\nAnyway, my friend and I had tickets to go see a concert in a city that was about 3 hours away. We made it there just fine and had a blast at the concert. We couldn't afford to stay overnight so we started on the long journey home. If all went well, we would get home around 3AM.\n\nThere was one stretch of highway where there was 60 ish miles between towns. It's pretty much the worst place to break down on that journey. There were big signs warning travelers to fill up with gas before leaving town, but I had half a tank. My truck sputtered out and died almost halfway between the two towns. It sure sounded like I ran out of gas but the gauge still showed half a tank. All had not gone well. \n\nSo there we were - 1:45 AM, stuck on the side of the highway in Texas, 30 miles from the nearest towns, no moonlight, and this was before teenagers had cell phones. We were screwed. After a bit of poking around with a flashlight, we discovered that we did have fuel but the fuel pump had died. We decided to sleep in the truck and mess with it in the morning. \n\nOn those old dodge trucks, the fuel pump was inside the engine instead of in the fuel tank like a modern vehicle. It was powered by the engine instead of an electric motor. Essentially, the fuel pump would constantly pump gasoline when the engine was running and gas would always be available for the carburetor float valve. The extra pumped gas would just go back into the gas tank.\n\nI was just drifting off to sleep when I got an idea. I worked for almost an hour in the pitch dark. I used some extra hose from an agricultural fertilizer, a drink straw, screw clamps, and duck tape to rig the windshield fluid pump to pump fuel from the fuel line into the carburetor float line.\n\nI got in my truck, hit the windshield fluid lever, and the truck started right up. It took a bit of trial and error but I was able to get the timing down where I knew how often to hit the lever to keep the truck running.\n\nWe made it back home just after 4:30AM. My dad wasn't immediately amused with my handy work, but he told all of his friends how clever his son was so I guess it passed the dad test. ",

We had a professor who was kind of a hardass, along with a delightfully scatterbrained old-guy assistant professor. One of our assignments was to write a paper, which I put off and then ended up not doing.\n\nOf course, I *had* to do the paper in order to pass. So eventually I got around to writing it, weeks after the due date. After the class where everyone's papers were returned to them, I went up to the professor - with assistant professor also present - and explained that I *had* handed in the paper a day or two late, but had indeed handed it to the assistant professor in the hall one day, and was just wondering if I'd be getting mine back? Assistant professor actually said that he *remembered me handing it to him* and that he must have misplaced it.\n\nSo I offered to print it off again and bring it with me to the next class. Which I did, and I passed. In hindsight it was all way more work than just doing it when I was supposed to, but I was a stupid lazy ass in those days.",

I just found it so intensely boring, I couldn't help but fall asleep in every class without fail. \n\nThis was a small country school in rural Ireland, so our class only had about 20 students. Falling asleep was pretty risky since it wouldn't be difficult for someone to notice. On top of that, I sat in the first row, right in front of my easily-agitated teacher, who regularly lost her temper with students and would often loudly discipline them for even the smallest infractions.\n\nThat day I'd nodded off as usual, only to be jarred awake by my friend sharply elbowing me in the rib. I didn't have time to express my surprise before I realised that the teacher had asked me a direct question and was waiting for a response. \n\nSince I'd not heard her query at all and therefore had idea what her question even was, I snapped out of my dream and groggily mumbled \"Uh, it means... they're not... doing their jobs... properly?\" \n\nMy teacher's face lit up as she broke into a rare smile. \"Yes, exactly! I'm so glad *someone* here has been paying attention.\"\n\nOver 15 years later and still amazed I got away with it.\n\nEdit: Changed some wording to be less \"annoying\" vocab-wise.

Figured, \"hey, I'll pay online, excellent!\" only to find out that the fucking website wanted me to put in the dollar amount of my previous water bill when signing up with an online account.  I tried the current and only water bill I had, no luck, came back with an error.\n\nSo I said fuck it, let's see if they're sanitizing their database inputs:  put a \\* in for the value and tried again.  Success, it let me in, I paid my bill.\n\nFor the uninitiated, the reason this works is because their website was literally taking the information I was putting in to the website, and *without looking for special characters or malicious code*, querying the database with that directly using a language called SQL.  In SQL, the \\* is a wildcard, so their sql query probably looks something like \"select ACCOUNT from ACCOUNT_TABLE where USERNAME = <user_provided_username> AND ADDRESS = <user_provided_address> AND PREVIOUS_BILL_AMOUNT = <user_provided_value>\" (edit:  yes DBAs of Reddit, I'm aware that this is a gross oversimplification, the billing stuff is going to be in another table) - I had the first two, of course, but the last one I just gave it a \\* and, because they're not checking for stupid shit like this, it worked and I could see what I needed to to add the house to my account - bypassing their security entirely.  Odds are good I could have just put \\*s for all the fields and seen who lives at every address, and their previous water bills.\n\nI emailed them shortly thereafter saying that it was a security hole.  No response.\n\nA few years later I moved again.  I had my account, but to set up said online account's connection with the new address...  you guessed it, they wanted me to put in the value of my previous month's bill.

    "body": "I bought a vintage organ at a thrift store on a whim, despite the fact that the lower row of keys, the floor pedals, and some of the knobs/levers for controlling the sound were nonfunctional. I had the plan of moving it myself, but I didn't even realize the dimensions/weight of this beast, so I ended up having to pay for delivery as well. I almost backed out of the deal, given that delivery costed more than the actual organ, but I wanted a cool project to get into electronics.\n\n\nOnce it arrived at my apartment, I found an old manual online and proceed to open up the back to give it a quick look. This machine is incredibly complex and I don't have any electronics experience! There's all kinds of components for each of the effects, thousands of tiny wires routed all over the place, and a complex \"tonewheel\" mechanism which essentially consists of a thousand tiny gears of different sizes that generate the sound. I came to the realization that this would be a lifelong project, but I wanted to at least poke around inside to get started. \n\n\nSo, I slowly started taking apart the pieces, making sure to note the order and how I would get it back together. I knew the issues, not the solutions, but I was hoping to find something obvious enough to correct. Well, I did find a few loose wires here and there, so with my shaky hands I did my best to solder them back in place. I saw an oil tube as well and decided to break that open for the first time to lubricate the 45 year old tonewheels. At this point, I became concerned that I'd never get this thing back together, and I had no idea what else to address - there was no neon sign inside with an arrow pointing to a wire saying, \"Fix this and you'll be all set!\" - so I put the thing back together. \n\n\nOnce again, I figured this would be a lifelong project, and I wasn't too frustrated by that fact. It was pretty interesting after all. That said, I wanted to plug it back in and see if I did more harm than good in my naive tinkering. \n\n\nI flip the switch and the big, foam mechanical tremolo wheel in the back of the cabinet begins to whir. Okay, so far so good. That still works. I adjust the accent pedal to bring the volume up. Nice! I didn't fuck the top keys up! Why not try the lower ones too? Hmmm. Still nothing. Maybe if I adjust the drawbars a bit and... oh my god. I fixed this thing? In one afternoon? Okay, calm down. It's not like the floor pedals will be- FIXED? I pressed a few with my left foot and heard that rich bassy lower octave fill the room. \n\n**TL;DR: So that's how I essentially fixed a vintage organ in a few hours, rather than many years, despite having no electronics experience.**\n\n\nSide note: It's still not perfect, but everything plays and it's pretty close to where I wanted it to be.

I'm a bit handy with technology, and nobody else in the office was, so eventually I became the go-to person for talking to the IT people (we were in GA, they were in OH.)  I became fairly good friends with one of them, and we'd chat and talk a lot.  Roundabout 2004, the company (a wholesale distributor) is breaking away from merely attending industry trade shows and is trying their hand at hosting their own in a location far away from the home office, and of course a certain amount of networking and infrastructure needs to be set up.\n\nThe first day of the show, I'm in our regional office almost by myself (low man on the totem pole stays behind to watch the fire), when my IT friend calls me in a blind panic.  They've set up all the systems, everything checked out yesterday and worked fine, but overnight there was some kind of event that forced a room full of computers to reboot and ask for a login and password...and nobody in the goddamned company has any idea what the password might be.  They feel sure they have the login, but not the password.  It's apparently never happened before.\n\nNow bear in mind, she didn't call me because I'm some kind of Hackerman with leet skeelz.  She called me because they had exhausted pretty much every other option and were completely desperate; this was about to turn into an incredibly expensive fuckaround for the company and she was playing a wild card.\n\nSo she asks me \"Can you think of anything, doesn't matter how dumb or ridiculous it might be, that we can try here?\"  We're on speaker phone, I can hear a room full of corporate potentates including the company President waiting to see if this Hail Mary's gonna pay off.  The only thing I can think of is \"Maybe try no password at all?  Just leave it blank?\"\n\nSomeone in the room says \"Oh, come ON, no way,\" but they try it.  You know how NASA cheers when they land something on another planet?  It was a lot like that.  My dumb ass was a hero, and I got a nice bonus that Christmas.  That was also the first time I heard \"If it looks stupid, but it works, then it ain't stupid.\"",

So I got released for the last 8 hours of my 10 hour shift. Seems being high on coke is no-no even for interns in the ER. Who knew?",

The day it was due I brainstormed before school and got a stick, string, and a block of wood and made a bow drill fire starter. It took 10 minutes and it had to do because I had to get to the bus stop. At school, most of the students had these elaborate concoctions they spent a huge amount of time on (like a headdress or a tipi) and I had a stick. Everyone had to show their Indian artifact in front of the class, so I showed how my stick would have been used with the help of a couple classmates. I explained it while they demonstrated,  but I really wanted to just go sit down because my lame stick was embarrassing. Funny enough, they were really into it and actually got it to really start to smoke (I never tried it beforehand). The teacher had to make them stop and the whole class was intrigued. I got an A on the project that I put almost no effort into but sling something together to try to avoid the awkward embarrassment of sitting in class with nothing to show. \n   Btw, I\u2019m older.

Mmm.\n\nSuddenly it came to me; I rushed to the hobby-shop and bought stickers for 3D wishing cards, cut them into tiny pieces and put them under the key....and it works like a charm!!! Even 'clicks' like before. Doesn't feel like it of course but the wtf-moment compensates that 8-)\n\nHappy man :)\n\nEdit: some advice-parts.",

My wife was getting upset, because what do you do when your antique Corvair-powered camper breaks down in rural Pennsylvania? \n\nWe broke down.\n\nI lifted the engine hatch cover (The engine is under the bed!) and looked in. I remembered a comedian's bit about how his car had broken down and, not knowing anything about cars, he opened the hood and stared at it, hoping to see a big switch set in the \"Broken\" position. I saw a small toggle switch in the back of the engine compartment, and, trying to ease my wife's mind, said, \"Oh, HERE'S the problem! This switch is set to 'Broken'!\" \n\nAs I pointed to the switch, I noticed that the high-voltage wire on the ignition coil wasn't plugged in all the way. It was close enough for the spark to jump the gap, but when we hit rough road, it bounced looser and made the spark plugs not fire. \n\nI plugged it all the way in, and the engine ran perfectly for the rest of the 600-mile trip.\n\n[Here's](https://imgur.com/a/vTt1y) \"Violet\", Ultra Van #276, on our trip from Pittsburgh, PA to Watkins Glen, NY and back.",

In a desperate hurry, he went to the computer lab, pulled up a \u201cMeursault as an existentialist hero\u201d essay about Camus\u2019s \"The Stranger\" that he had written a couple months earlier, then quickly used CTRL+F to replace every \u201cMeursault\u201d with \u201cBilly Pilgrim,\u201d every \u201cCamus\u201d with \u201cVonnegut,\u201d and so on. He took an indented quotation about Meursault shooting an Arab on the beach and replaced it with some random plot event from Slaughterhouse Five. He changed a couple other things as quickly as possible, printed the essay out, and headed to class.\n\nBefore we handed in our essays, Anthony showed me his half-baked effort. \u201cBilly Pilgrim as an Existentialist Hero.\u201d I\u2019d edited his Meursault essay during a peer review a couple months earlier. It was instantly recognizable that this was the same essay. I rolled my eyes at him and said, \u201cyou idiot, you\u2019re actually handing this in?\u201d He said something along the lines of, \u201cYeah, I\u2019m totally fucked.\u201d\n\nAbout two weeks later, we\u2019re getting our essays back. As we\u2019re going to class, he\u2019s running through worse case scenarios with me. \u201cMy grade already sucks in that class\u2026she\u2019s gonna punish me for plagiarism\u2026I\u2019m gonna fail senior English, they\u2019re not going to let me go to Boulder\u2026\u201d I\u2019m trying to reassure him that it\u2019ll all be fine, but it\u2019s half-hearted. It\u2019s pretty within Ms. A\u2019s character to bury him for this.\n\nThe papers get passed back. I\u2019m sitting directly across the room, facing Anthony, and I can see his face morph from fear into complete disbelief when he receives his paper. Anthony didn\u2019t have the easiest emotions to read, so I mistook his expression for, \u201cYep, I\u2019m screwed.\u201d\n\nHe looks up at me, then holds his paper up so I can see it: A+.\nMs. A\u2019s comments were along the lines of, \u201cUnbelievable work! To take concepts like nihilism and existentialism, that we had learned about months earlier, and then to apply them to something completely different is really amazing! Best paper I\u2019ve read this school year!\u201d",

I ran into the pack, they freaked out and scattered. \n\nAnother time a bear crossed a path a friend and I were using. It looked at us, we looked at it. The bear grunted and walked on.

For the curious it was just a black bear. Big enough to scare me stiff though. \n\nI think the worst is snakes. They just stay where they are, and hope you don\u2019t step on \u2018em.

Imagine a modernish take on asteroids with 2d physics, down to the spin some impacts might cause. I wanted the aliens to actually dodge. Like they would bounce off and get stunned if they did collide with one.\n\nI imagined that I would have to do some kind of thing where each alien knew maybe the 2 or 3 closest objects that were a threat, as well as the relevant target (the player). I was thinking about algorithms to work out the optimal path between obstacles, consider their velocity and direction. It seemed complicated.\n\nSo I started with one. The alien would head towards the target, and would turn away from the single nearest threat, but only if it was close. It didn't consider velocity, direction, any of that.\n\nAnd it worked perfectly. The aliens would swarm across a complex dynamic field of asteroids and weave and dodge through them with apparent skill that belied the simple algorithm. Very occasionally one would get trapped, like if multiple asteroids kind of came together at once - but even those rare cases seemed natural and made sense. The aliens would be stunned, and would react like an uncontrolled object in 2d space for a bit before regaining control - or continuing to bounce around pinball style for a while.\n\nAnyway. That was pretty cool. I think game AI is sometimes best achieved with efficient heuristic methods that can be constantly running.",

    "body": "In my youth I had a summer job at a paper mill and pretty early on I was told the story of \"Bob\" \n\nBob was this absolute legend of a man amongst the blue-collars. Everyone knew Bob, he had been working there for ages as did his father before him. He knew everyone, he was always friendly, helpful and wise. He knew how everything around the mill worked and no matter how busy he was, he always took the time needed to listen to your troubles or help you out with this or that. Everyone loved him.\n\nWhat really made him a legend thou, a true hero of the masses, was when he went into retirement. So management, the white-collars, started looking for a replacement for Bob. \n\n*\"So we need a replacement for this guy, so what did this guy do?... hey!.. what DID this guy do?\"* \n\nTurns out that Bobs job as a packer or some such had been made obsolete something like ten years prior by some automation process but somehow he had not been sacked. Instead Bobs last ten years at the company was spent with a plank on his shoulder and a toolbox in hand, simply walking around this huge mill drinking coffee with the different work groups and sometimes but not too often helping out where an extra hand was needed for a minute or so.\n\nWhen confronted by management he simply replied that he came and left work when he was supposed to and that it wasn't his fault that he had nothing to do whilst there, that was their job.",

The bell noise allows bears to hear them coming from a distance and not be startled by a hiker accidentally sneaking up on them. This might cause a bear to charge.\nVisitors should also carry a pepper spray can just in case a bear is encountered. Spraying the pepper into the air will irritate the bear's sensitive nose and it will run away.\n\nIt is also a good idea to keep an eye out for fresh bear scat so you have an idea if bears are in the area. People should be able to recognize the difference between black bear and grizzly bear scat.\n\nBlack bear droppings are smaller and often contain berries, leaves, and possibly bits of fur. \n\nGrizzly bear droppings tend to contain small bells and smell of pepper.\n\n\nedit: This post is now my \"Holy shit!

    "body": "Ha, that's great. Worked in a brigade hq S2 office with a vault here. The vault was in the hallway next to the S2 offices where the SFC and the Major did their thing. The vault was great because first off, anyone without at least a secret clearance wasn't getting in, and second, we had a tv in there that we could watch the news on (we had other channels, but if anyone important walked in the vault while you were watching cable, the illusion of working was over and you were fucked).\n\nOne day, half my squad was down at the motor pool breaking track and doing pmcs. For those who don't know, breaking track is done when you have to remove a broken link from a tracked vehicle like a tank, apc, etc. It's a pain in the ass, takes a while, and is generally not fun in a concrete motor pool during a Texas summer. That group was expected back a little before lunch, and all I had to do was run some papers up to the division S2. I drug the delivery out for about an hour and a half; stopping at the store, heading up to my barracks room, and eventually meandering my way back to the office.\n\nWhen I got back, luckily, there was nobody really around: one lieutenant doing paperwork, and a pfc who was tasked with screening clearance applications for obvious problems before submitting. A good rule of thumb for lower enlisted in the military is \"if you don't have something to do, you will be given something to do.\" With that in mind, and knowing I can't excusably leave the general area, I went into the vault to \"straighten up the files\" (ie: watch the news and relax in the air conditioning).\n\nBefore I could relax, I had to set up my workspace though. I took a pile of random junk papers and spread them out over the table so it looked like they were in the process of being sorted. Then I grabbed a yellow legal pad and wrote a bunch of scribbles and words that had things to do with daily tasks (track, division, hmmwv, pmcs, etc). I circled a few words, made arrows pointing to other words, and basically made prop \"indecipherable notes.\" \n\nAfter maybe 10 minutes of happily watching tv, I could hear the vault door start to open, and one of the guys working on our track came in to see if the SFC was here since they were done a little early. I told him \"No, but he might be over in the office.\" and resumed fake working. He left to go sit in the office and wait for the platoon sergeant to get back.\n\nAbout 15 minutes after that, I could hear the door opening again. I got back to the act, looked serious, and started jotting more nonsense notes on the legal pad. My staff sergeant opened the door, and obviously had something he wanted since he was looking around impatiently. He started off with \"Hey, SteveTheAmazing, what are you doing? I need a soldier.\" I looked up from my \"notes\", stared him in the eye with a grim expression of seriousness and concentration, and, in a low voice, I said \"Thinking.\"\n\nMy staff sergeant stopped where he was and just stood there looking bewildered. I immediately went back to my \"notes\" and ignored his presence until he simply said \"I'll, uh, leave you to it then.\" and walked out of the vault. The second he left, I could hear him yell the name of the other soldier that was just sitting in the office and told him he needed him for a \"special project.\" They ended up going back to the motor pool for the rest of the day, and I somehow got out of it by shameless, go-for-broke shamming.\n\n\nTl;dr - Staff sergeant needed someone for a shitty task in 100\u00b0+ heat, got out of it by confusing him saying I was \"Thinking.\"\n\n",
