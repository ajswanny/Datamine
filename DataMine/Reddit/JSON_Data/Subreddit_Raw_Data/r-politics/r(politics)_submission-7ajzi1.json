Matt Gaetz  \nAndy Biggs of Arizona  \nLouie Gohmert of Texas  \n  \n**TRAITORS**  \n  \n_____________\n\n**Note:** Let me use this highly upvoted post as platform to add something of more substance. Something to be on the watch for:  \n  \nRegarding Russia's manipulation campaign on Facebook/Twitter/(Reddit). [I'm seeing it](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/7aj7b1/former_twitter_employee_says_fake_russian/) here right now on a post I created. I've seen maybe 20 responses like this.\n  \nResponders are saying \"only stupid people would believe this, we should educate them\" \"did anyone really believe this stuff?\" or \"as Abraham Lincoln said, don't trust everything you read on the internet.\" It's an attempt to completely redirect from the massive disinfo campaign to make the conversation about if people are stupid and \"we have to educate people\" -- putting the onus on American people instead of Russia and the campaigns who allowed this.   \n  \nIn my opinion it doesn't even matter if people believe the posts (they did... and shared the hell out of them) what matters even more is that Russia undertook a campaign, a full-frontal cyber assault on democracy. Just a remarkble note I read in today's NYT: 150 Million people saw the Russian Facebook ads. And additionally the Russias operatives created 80,000 posts that were shared across the networks.\n  \n",

Linked directly from the article. \n\n**EDIT (11/3/2017, 1:30 PM EST)**\n\nIt looks as though they updated the article. The original link was a hyperlink from the word \"Resolution\" in the first sentence to the house resolution I posted above. They have since removed that link. \n\nThat being said, I went to see if perhaps there was a new resolution that I had missed. [Based on my search here](https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/browse#sponsor=412690&current_status[]=1&sort=-introduced_date), it doesn't look as though Matt Gaetz has introduced anything since the middle of last month. \n\nIf anyone is able to find the actual resolution or they update the article further. Let me know and I will update my comment.\n\n**EDIT (1:45 PM EST)**\n\nRegardless of whether or not it's a new resolution. [Gaetz does seem to be embracing it](https://gaetz.house.gov/media/press-releases/congressman-matt-gaetz-introduces-resolution-calling-recusal-mueller-special).\n\nLooks more like he's making a renewed push to revive a dead resolution he made previously.

Time to discuss the concept of \"regression towards the mean...\" Which is a big fancy way of saying \"on average, you're going to have an average day.\"\n\nIf today you have a really super awesome day, well that means probably tomorrow will be not as fun. Simply because it will be average instead of super awesome. So it will be a bit of a let-down.\n\nBut the opposite is also true! If you have a really crappy awful day/week/year, then the next one almost certainly will be *better.* It might not be super awesome, but just mathematically speaking its very probable that it will turn around.\n\nI say this to myself every time I'm having a bad day... lots of little things just pile up and you feel pretty low. Well, I take a deep breath, relax a bit if I can, then power through it. Because its probably going to turn around soon. And if it doesn't turn around today, it probably will tomorrow. And if not tomorrow, then that *increases* the odds that it will turn around the day after.\n\nMath is on your side, buddy! So you got that going for you. Which is nice.",

If you make it frustrating, confusing, confounding, etc., people will get fed up and will tune-out, and/or blame both parties and the entire system, when clearly only one party in the system is ANTI the system (as Jon Stewart has pointed out, it's a great scam they have going - claim government doesn't work and isn't effective, while you're simultaneously helping make it so from within). \n\nIt's a very effective strategy, that most people never bother to realize is intentional and that they're playing right into it - obviously this requires looking skeptically at republicans, who are constantly fighting to win over the hearts and minds of people. This is also why the entire party is reliant on keeping its voters uneducated, and steeped in religious dogma, and why they are also waging a war on education. Without dumb, easily manipulated people at their disposal, they wouldn't have enough people to keep the ruling class wealthy.\n\nThe religious angle is really annoying too, but is such a key part of this. If you look at the Russian ads that Facebook released the other day, almost every one has some sort of religious angle to it - most comparing Hillary to satan or saying Donald was \"god's choice\".

This story is just a gross misrepresentation of reality, it's not 100% fantasy. You want some truly fake news? There was a guy in Austin who saw some buses outside the convention center. Checked the center's website and didn't see an event listed, so he went onto twitter and declared that the anti-Trump protesters in the city were bussed in, and he'd just found the buses. Of course, there actually was an event going on at the center, and the buses had nothing to do with the protests, but the truth didn't matter to the 350k people who shared it, or the conservative blogs that posted articles about it (and the \"Soros money\" paying for it, of course). Also didn't matter to Donald Trump, who referred to the protesters as \"professionals ... incited by the media\".\n\nThat's fake news. Utter garbage made up in someone's imagination, that gets passed around because people want it to be true.\n\nLink: https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/20/business/media/how-fake-news-spreads.html",

Around 40% percent of criminal cases that pass through the D.C. Circuit court are sealed, largely to protect vulnerable witnesses, or because defendants have struck plea bargains with Federal prosecutors in return for limited sentences or government protection.\n\n>...\n\n>There is one indication that Mueller has at least one more indictment up his sleeve. The Manafort indictment is marked as INDICTMENT (B), which presumes there's an **\"INDICTMENT (A)\"** lurking somewhere....
