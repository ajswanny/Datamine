    "body": "Ok. I have some clean time now, but I lived in the opiate world for years in the Northeast. I don't even need to read this story to tell you how much they turn a blind eye to the pipeline until it hits the streets. If I ever bought more than 100 pills, it was guaranteed to come in [this kind](https://i.imgur.com/lpuDTkN.jpg) of bottle. Not the kind you get a Rx in. The kind the pharmacy gets. \n\nSure, there are bound to be some pharmacies fudging numbers and selling some here and there, but in the quantity I had available to me at any time, there's no way these bottles were accounted for in any system anywhere. This was an employee of the pharmaceutical company selling these off book. I can't attest to anyone specific having knowledge, but someone knew. They know how much raw product they have, and how many pills they produce, and how many they ship to legit pharmaceutical vendors. \n\nI know for a fact that on a moment's notice I could get my hands on 500 pills, street value at the time of $25 each. That's a total of $12,500 retail. Buying in bulk my price was about half of that. I'd imagine the supplier saw half of what I gave to my middle man. I could conceivably do this every day. In reality I would buy around 100-150 a day, and I wasn't one of my guy's biggest customers. \n\nYou don't lose that much product and not notice. This is sanctioned by the company. I have zero doubt in mind. I'd also make the assumption that they lobbied to have the dea/police focus on street level busts, to leave their network in place. No one above my level ever got caught. Literally never. Not once in 8 years. People on my level, got popped a lot. People on my level had their house staked out, phones tapped, child services called, anything and everything to get eyes on them. The guy moving pallets out of the facility and driving them into the city, never gets caught. \n\nI can go a step further, it is not just opiates. The same networks are in place for Xanax, Adderall, and damn near anything else you want. I definitely know people who play the prescription game. But I guarantee you could stop every illegal Rx from being filled and not even scratch the surface of the amount of pills available on the black market. \n\nPSA: do drugs if you want, but not opiates. Have fun, be safe. ",

The underlining root cause of addiction 9 times out of 10 is mental illnesses. Yes i said it mental fucking illnesses! No person goes out and decides to become an addict but they use drugs as a crutch to help them out with their issues. Almost every addict i know who used things like oxys or heroin has an underlining mental illness and or chemical imbalance. We need to stop locking these people up! You may not agree with me on making drugs decriminalized but you need to understand these people need actual help not fake \"rehabilitation in prison.\" I know our government tells you that prisons are meant to rehabilitate people but that is false and if you actually knew people who have server a lengthy bid you'd understand that it does no good for them at all, when you come out with a felony, life becomes a hell of a lot harder for you. Prisons are the modern day slave trade. Private prisons are beyond fucked up, you can literally buy stocks in them because they are companies. Private prisons should be illegal but i won't get into that in this post, but fuck them! Addicts need actual help! They need actual help with their mental health problems, locking them up does not give them this help! There's a reason why police unions have lobbied to give minimum sentences for drug possession. It's the reason police departments across the country get to do an awesome thing called \"civil asset forfeiture\" if you don't know what that means, it means that even if you aren't convicted of a crime they can take and KEEP your money or cars or even house's as long as they say they believe it was used to commit a crime or bought with drug money or any other illegal activity! They don't even have to prove it! And if you want it back, well i hope you have a lot of money to spend on a very good attorney! Some towns will even just take your money if you're carrying a couple thousand dollars in your car! All they have to say it's drug money and boom that couple thousand dollars you had in the car because you're on vacation is now the police departments to be used for whatever they damn well please! I wish i was making this up, but i'm sadly not! Look it up if you don't believe me!\nAs long as there's a war on drugs your small town police department will get MRAP's, automatic rifles, drug dogs, military surplus vehicles and weapons! They will conduct no knock raids over small amounts of drugs (which you should be upset about). those street test they do when testing drugs are meant to show a false positive! People have been pulled over with glaze from a glazed donut, cop thought it was meth guess what that glazed donut showed up as during a street test, a man was arrested for it and later sued and won! \nDo you know who's been lobbying it states that are trying to decriminalize marijuana? Police unions, pharmaceutical companies and alcohol companies, that's who! I don't personally smoke but it can help with so many different things! Also Hemp is amazing, it can be used to make things like paper! We need trees and things like the rainforests! It's bio-degradable and can be used instead of plastic! The list goes on and on and on!\nWe need to open up more rehabilitation centers and detox's! We need to open up more places to help these addicts with their mental health problems! And we don't just need to put these people on more pills that only mask the problem for a time being! We need to do more research into other alternatives...",

All that's left of America's democracy is the ceremony and trappings, but none of the power needed for citizens to direct public policy that promotes their needs and hopes.\n\nWe know what needs to be done:\n\n1. end of gerrymandering\n\n2. Constitutional amendment entrenching the right to vote\n\n3. Reasonable limits on both campaign contributions and campaign spending, just like in real democracies\n\n4. End of the electoral college\n\n5. Adoption of a proportional representation electoral system for the House of Representatives.\n\n6. Removal of barriers to new parties and their participation in elections.\n\n7. Reduce the number of officials that are elected. Seriously, is it really necessary to elect sheriffs and prosecutors?\n\nIn other words, adopt the 'best practices' used in *real* democracies.\n\nThis requires Constitutional amendments. Perhaps the route to a Constitutional Convention is through the states, which unfortunately are, in some instances, as corrupt as the federal legislature.",

The problem, as it has been for a while now, is Americans ourselves.\n\nWe've allowed ourselves to become civically indigent, motivated by fads and tribes and rumor with almost no knowledge and no curiosity about the nature of our own democratic state. Is it any surprise that we sold away influence to the corporations in the form of 'pro-business' policy, or that the Senators and Representatives we send to our legislature are more interested in the opinions of political extremists, lobbyists, and the almighty dollar? \n\nThe average American can barely be motivated to vote, of course we've found ourselves led by the worst hucksters this country has to offer. Our democracy is not designed around an ambivalent body politic, it encourages, no, *requires* coalitions within parties, and the forfeiture of civic duty amongst the majority of American citizens has amplified the power of a degenerate semi-feudal elite.",

They allowed Pain Management clinics to see patients and then fill their scripts at the exact same place. Pain clinics set up shop, and they would write huge scripts (like 90 Oxys, 90 Percocet and 90 Xanax), and one doctor could see \"patients\" back to back to back all day long. People would come from all over the country to fill RXs in Florida (\"The OxyContin Express\"), and FL doctors filled 10x the amout of pain scripts than all other states COMBINED.

On a good month, I'll have pills left over, but if I have a few bad months in a row, and use up my pills for the month, I'm out of luck. The doctor can't (or wont? i dunno) write a prescription early, and I don't have enough of those months to legitimately ask for my dosage to be increased, so I don't--therefore I have no idea if he'd actually increase it or just tell me to suck it up. \n\nI learned the hard way to go ahead and get my prescription filled on the first day that I could, so that the good months would build me up a reserve to get me through the bad months.\n\nThere's also sometimes a total lack of logic in how stuff is done, mostly because we never did get the system so that medical info is shared between facilities and doctors. I had surgery a couple of months ago. No big deal, just gall bladder removal, done laparoscopically, so I had like 4 or 5 little incisions. The surgeon prescribed me 30 oxycodones. My usual pain med is hydrocodone; weaker and takes a longer time to kick in. Again, the surgery wasn't a big deal, but it WAS painful for a couple of days, so for a couple of days, I took the oxycodones. Then, because they not only make me high as the proverbial kite, they also sometimes make me nauseous, I set aside the oxycodone and started using my regular hydrocodone instead, which worked just fine for the surgery pain. The catch was that I was taking my hydrocodone every 4-6 hours for a few days, instead of only taking one or sometimes two per day. So, I ran out of them. Called the doctor. Nope, can't get new prescription for another week for the hydrocodone, so I wound up with no choice but to use the stronger oxycodone that I had left over for my regular chronic pain. Seems pretty silly to me---but that's the result of having the government make laws that tell doctors what they can and can't do, rather than allowing the doctors to prescribe what the patient actually needs. \n",

You either raised a bunch of money for some old people to go to DC and didn't bother to read the legislation (I guess they didn't get their interns to do so either) or you raised a bunch of money for some old people to go to DC to profit on your hard work.

It's surreal to watch Harry Reid talk about how they passed some bill that they, uh, didn't read. Then you got Rand Paul introducing some stupid resolution essentially named \"Read the bill\" many times (including the passage of the ACA) because everyone has the drive to get the win without wanting to face the full impact of their legislation - leaving the public to be the CBO in the worst way possible.",

His words on race were in no way radical and they were very hard to find argument with if you actually listened to him talk instead of out-of-context sound bytes with the messages twisted by Fox News pundits.

They are chartered with the mission to regulate the availability of atomic structures that biologically active, extremely profitable, offer escapism and in high demand on an unregulated black market by using the threat of incarceration and military-style tactics, often working with the CIA to destabilize entire regional governments (The CIA has been caught on more than one occasion taking advantage of the extremely high price cocaine fetches on the black market to fund operations it doesn't want officially on the books) and interfere with the doctor-patient relationship by gradually eroding civil liberties and confidentiality that has been historically considered sacrosanct, and all ostensibly in the name of public health and safety? \n\n I mean if you really think about it, it's laughable man HAH! And now they go whining to 60 minutes when they're not granted and entrusted with even MORE power to interfere with an already overly regulated commerce of moving legitimate pain control products.  It's completely nuts.  The \"epidemic\" we are seeing is a result of the pharmacological affects of Fentanyl and it's analogs manufactured in China and distributed clandestinely not by Merk or Phiser but by unregulated networks that establish themselves in the absence of a regulated legal distribution network.   \n\nThe first innovation in 50 years, The Silk Road, comes along and not only do they shut it down but they also steal tens of millions of dollars from the owners and engage in wide-scale extortion of everyone with access to these precious molecules, from doctors, to chemists, to website operators, for-profit jails and addicts.  The DEA is the most useless, idiotic thing to come out of a government since the inception of government.  It was designed to fail and to act as a jobs program for BOP officials that wouldn't make it anywhere else.  They will never win.  When will they learn?",

    "body": ">It blows my mind that lobbyists are such a big and widely accepted thing. I can't imagine why your average person doesn't give a shit about that type of thing.  \n\nYour average person only has so much mental energy to spare. Work, school, kids, house, spouse, hobbies, and politics. Now split that politics focus into separate issues - most voters will care about what most obviously affects them first, financially or morally. Taxes, guns, abortions, gay rights, criminal justice... Lobbyists require a part of that finite focus, and they aren't immediately obvious in their impact. \"Well, everyone wants their representatives to listen to them.\"\n\nSo, the average voter kicks \"lobbying reform\" down to the middle / bottom rungs of their priorities. In the meantime, lobbyists focus all their work energy on lobbying. They're busy doing it EVERY DAY. The average voter might send an email once a year to their representative. The average lobbyist is emailing once a DAY. And calling, and donating, and organizing fundraisers, and coordinating PAC ads. Even if you left out the massive amount of money funneled to representatives, lobbyists are paid to cultivate those relationships as a full time job. They have name recognition with the representatives and their staff. They're seen as experts in their fields, so when a representative needs advice on a specific field - they'll go to the lobbyist, who will be happy to explain why their particular POV is best, give resources, and even write parts of the bill. (Or the whole thing, fuck you very much, ALEC.)  They make the lives of representatives much, much easier. \n\nNow... weigh all that perceived help and business relationships... against the occasional email from a constituent, or the occasional meeting with anti-lobbyist lobbyists. That balance is why the average voter accepts it. They didn't care a lot to start with, they know the deck is stacked against them on the subject, and their representatives go out of their way to play down the impact of professional lobbyist so they can preserve their own interests. And in the rare occasions that the opposition gets organized enough to start having a chance - the lobbyists have tons of media experience. They'll attack whatever measure is being floated as \"silencing ordinary citizens\", or simply pick holes in it to give their representatives cover when they kill the bill.\n\nIn short, people do care. They're just massively outgunned. ",
