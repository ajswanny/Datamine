THIS however is DIRECTLY about collusion. And if he has flipped, and was integral to the whole scheme of collusion, then this is a huge deal. \n\nAlso something to keep in mind with this charge, and the charges on Manafort and Gates is that these charges are something that are HIGHLY probable to be mirrored with other individuals in this investigation. Flynn would likely end up with FARA charges, as well as lying to FBI. Trump family has endless shady business deals, Kushner as well, Kushner lied about countless foreign contacts.

Defendant PAPADOPOULOS acknowledged\nthat the professor had told him about the Russians possessing \"dirt\" on then-candidate Hillary\nClinton in the form of \"thousands of emails,\" but stated multiple times that he learned that\ninformation prior to joining the Campaign. In truth and in fact, however, defendant\nPAPADOPOULOS learned he would be an advisor to the Campaign in early March, and met the\nprofessor on or about March 14, 2016; the professor only took interest in defendant\nPAPADOPOULOS because of his status with the Campaign; and the professor told defendant\nPAPADOPOULOS about the \"thousands of emails\" on or about April 26, 2016, when defendant\nPAPADOPOULOS had been a foreign policy adviser to the Campaign for over a month. \n\nBest Monday ever!\n\n>**II. Timeline of Selected Events**  \n>PAPADOPOULOS's Role on the Campaign  \n4. In early March 2016, defendant PAPADOPOULOS learned he would be a foreign\npolicy advisor for the Campaign. Defendant PAPADOPOULOS was living in London, England,\nat the time. Based on a conversation that took place on or about March 6, 2016, with a\nsupervisory campaign official (the \"Campaign Supervisor\"), defendant PAPADOPOULOS\nunderstood that a principal foreign policy focus of the Campaign was an improved U.S.\nrelationship with Russia.\n\n>**PAPADOPOULOS 's Introduction to the Professor and the Female Russian National**  \n>5. On or about March 14, 2016, while traveling in Italy, defendant\nPAPADOPOULOS met an individual who was a professor based in London (the \"Professor\").\nInitially, the Professor seemed uninterested in defendant PAPADOPOULOS. However, after\ndefendant PAPADOPOULOS infonned the Professor about his joining the Campaign, the\nProfessor appeared to take great interest in defendant PAPADOPOULOS. Defendant\nPAPADOPOULOS was interested in the Professor because, among other reasons, the Professor\nclaimed to have substantial connections with Russian government officials, which defendant\nPAPADOPOULOS thought could increase his importance as a policy advisor to the Campaign.  \n>6. On or about March 21, 2016, the Campaign told The Washington Post that\ndefendant PAPADOPOULOS was one of five named foreign policy advisors for the Campaign.  \n>7. On or about March 24, 2016, defendant PAPADOPOULOS met with the\nProfessor in London. **The Professor brought with him a female Russian national (the \"Female\nRussian National\"), introduced to defendant PAPADOPOULOS as a relative of Russian\nPresident Vladimir Putin with connections to senior Russian government officials.**\n\n\"Female Russian National\" introduced as a relative of Putin...perhaps the lawyer from Jr.'s meeting at Trump Tower? Ahahaha these motherfuckers are gonna fry\n\n> **10. After his trip to Washington, D.C., defendant PAPADOPOULOS worked with the\nProfessor and the Female Russian National to arrange a meeting between the Campaign and the\nRussian government, and took steps to advise the Campaign of his progress.** \n\nThere it is folks. A Trump foreign policy adviser was working with a Russian National--who identified herself as a relative of Putin--to arrange a meetings between the Trump Campaign and the Russian government. And kept the Campaign apprised of his progress. The fact that this is public means Mueller is going for the kill.\n\nEdit: [The FBI interview where Papadopolous lied happened on Jan27th.

Defendant PAPADOPOULOS stated that the topic of their discussion was \"to arrange a meeting between us and the Russian leadership to discuss U.S.-Russia ties under President Trump.\"\n\n[...]\n\n> In early April 2016, defendant PAPADOPOULOS sent multiple emails to other members of the Campaign's foreign policy team regarding his contacts with \"the Russians\" and his \"outreach to Russia. On or about April 10, 2016, defendant PAPADOPOULOS emailed the Female Russian National, who responded the next day, on or about April 11, 2016, that she \"would be very pleased to support your initiatives between our two countries.\" Defendant PAPADOPOULOS then asked the Female Russian National, in an email cc'ing the Professor, about setting up \"a potential foreign policy trip to Russia.\"\n\n[...]\n\n> The Professor responded to defendant PAPADOPOULOS's email later that day, on or about April 11, 2016: \"This is already been agreed. I am flying to Moscow on the 18th for a Valdai meeting, plus other meetings at the Duma.\" The Duma is a Russian government legislative assembly. The Female Russian National responded: \"I have already alerted my personal links to our conversation and your request.... As mentioned we are all very excited by the possibility of a good relationship with Mr. Trump. The Russian Federation would love to welcome him once his candidature would be officially announced.\"\n\n[...]\n\n> On or about April 25, 2016, defendant PAPADOPOULOS emailed a senior policy advisor for the Campaign (the \"Senior Policy Advisor\"): \"The Russian government has an open invitation by Putin for Mr. Trump to meet him when he is ready H. The advantage of being in London is that these governments tend to speak a bit more openly in 'neutral' cities.\"\n\n[...]\n\n> On or about April 26, 2016, defendant PAPADOPOULOS met the Professor for breakfast at a London hotel. During this meeting, the Professor told defendant PAPADOPOULOS that he had just returned from a trip to Moscow where he had met with high-level Russian government officials. The Professor told defendant PAPADOPOULOS that on that trip he (the Professor) learned that the Russians had obtained \"dirt\" on then-candidate Clinton. The Professor told defendant PAPADOPOULOS, as defendant PAPADOPOULOS later described to the FBI, that \"They [the Russians] have dirt on her\"; \"the Russians had emails of Clinton\"; \"they have thousands of emails.\"\n\n[...]\n\n> On or about June 1, 2016, defendant PAPADOPOULOS emailed the High-Ranking Campaign Official and asked about Russia. The High-Ranking Campaign Official referred him to the Campaign Supervisor because \"[h]e is running point.\" Defendant PAPADOPOULOS then emailed the Campaign Supervisor, with the subject line \"Re: Messages from Russia\": \"I have the Russian MFA asking me if Mr. Trump is interested in visiting Russia\".\n\n[...]\n\n> The government notes that the official forwarded defendant PAPADOPOULOS's email to another Campaign official (without including defendant PAPADOPOULOS) and stated: \"Let[']s discuss. We need someone to communicate that DT is not doing these trips. It should be someone low level in the campaign so as not to send any signal.\"\n\nThis all happened during the campaign (and Papadopoulos lied about the timeframe). Campaign officials knew.

As mentioned we are all very excited by the possibility of a good relationship with Mr. Trump. The Russian Federation would love to welcome him once his candidature would be officially announced.\"\n\n* By April the professor sent an email introducing GP to \"The Russian MFA Connection\"  (Ministry of Foreign Affairs), and they skyped for a few weeks to set up a meeting\n\n* GP wanted to meet in London with their Ambassador present\n\n* A campaign \"senior policy advisor\" was kept apprised of these developments: \"open invitation by Putin for Mr. Trump to meet him when he is ready[.] The advantage of being in London is that these governments tend to speak a bit more openly in 'neutral' cities.\"\n\n* April 26 GP meets the professor in London and they discuss \"dirt\" on HC. He then updated the senior campaign advisor about \"interesting messages coming in from Moscow about a trip when the time is right.\"\n\n* GP thanked the professor on helping to arrange the meeting and said \"it's history making if it happens.\"\n\n* **May 4, email from Russian MFA: \"I have just talked to my colleagues from the MFA. They are open for cooperation.\" GP forwarded again and asked \"What do you think? Is this something we want to move forward with?\"** There were some phone conversations between GP and the campaign supervisor then on May 13 the professor emailed GP with \"an update\" of what they had discussed in their \"recent conversations,\" including \"we will continue to liase through you with the Russian counterparts in terms of what is needed for a high level meeting of Mr. Trump with the Russian Federation.\"\n\n* The higher ups forwarded amongst themselves that DT would not be taking the trips and \"it should be someone low level in the campaign so as not to send any signal.\"\n\n* By June 19th he still hadn't secured anything and emailed the campaign supervisor \"The Russian MFA messaged and said that if DT is unable to make it to Russia if a campaign rep (me or someone else) can make it for meetings? I am willing to make the trip off the record if it's in the interest of Mr. Trump and the campaign to meet specific people.\" Reminder that Trump Tower meeting was June 9 which GP appears not to know about\n\n* August 15 GP was told \"I would encourage you\" and another foreign policy advisor to the campaign \"to make the trip, if it is feasible.\" The trip never took place.\n  ",

Who is the professor?\n\nEdit: So apparently Papa thought \"Female Russian National\" was actually Putin's neice.\n\nEdit 2: Emphasis on the \"they found out anyways.\" They've clearly got tapes of the phone calls here from what I'm reading.\n\nEdit 3: Should clarify because I'm being careless with my wording. Papadopolous did not set up the Trump Tower meeting, because we already know Goldstone arranged that specific meeting because of the emails that Don Jr released. The question to answer here is who informed the campaign that the Kremlin and MFA had Clinton emails and wanted to share with Trump? We now know that Papadopolous was at least one of the origins of collusion. In that way he put the wheels into motion that caused the Trump Tower meeting to happen.",

On or about March 14, 2016, while traveling in Italy, defendant\nPAPADOPOULOS met an individual who was a professor based in London (the \"Professor\").\nInitially, the Professor seemed uninterested in defendant PAPADOPOULOS. However, after\ndefendant PAPADOPOULOS infonned the Professor about his joining the Campaign, the\nProfessor appeared to take great interest in defendant PAPADOPOULOS. Defendant\nPAPADOPOULOS was interested in the Professor because, among other reasons, the Professor\nclaimed to have substantial connections with Russian government officials, which defendant\nPAPADOPOULOS thought could increase his importance as a policy advisor to the Campaign.  \n>6. On or about March 21, 2016, the Campaign told The Washington Post that\ndefendant PAPADOPOULOS was one of five named foreign policy advisors for the Campaign.  \n>7. On or about March 24, 2016, defendant PAPADOPOULOS met with the\nProfessor in London. **The Professor brought with him a female Russian national (the \"Female\nRussian National\"), introduced to defendant PAPADOPOULOS as a relative of Russian\nPresident Vladimir Putin with connections to senior Russian government officials.**\n\n\"Female Russian National\" introduced as a relative of Putin...perhaps the lawyer from Jr.'s meeting at Trump Tower?

Trump's base will refuse to believe overlord did anything wrong and will show up in mass to midterms because that's what they do. Democrats will win a few seats back in the House but will still be a minority and don't gain anything in the Senate. 5 or 6 Republicans with some sort of spine hold up any big legislation and nothing happens until 2020. \n\nThis all assumes we don't launch a nuclear warhead at North Korea.
