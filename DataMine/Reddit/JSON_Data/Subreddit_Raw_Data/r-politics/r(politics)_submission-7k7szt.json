The FCC should NEVER have the power to stop an investigation into themselves. No one should. This year has exposed the government for making themselves above the law on all counts. That shit needs to end. They should face three times the punishment for their crimes in fact. I think we need establish and accountability act for all government officials and take away their ability to recieve any donations from anyone. Once they get held accountable for doing wrong and can no longer make money from big corporations, the bad people will leave because there will be nothing in it for them. Right now our government is full on going rogue. How are we going to stop that? Any ideas considering the law is a lost cause?",

But this endless parade of **nonstop literal crimes** coming out, day after day after day, it's exhausting to watch - I can't imagine living through it. Your country is dying in front of your eyes. It's easy to sit and watch Stephen Colbert and John Oliver joke about it, but I'm waiting for the day where they sit at their desk and say, \"There are no more jokes for this. It's irresponsible to make light of this anymore.\"\n\nJust -- I can't, man. I'm not even American and I can't. Can literally 200 million of you just not go to work for a couple days in protest? Literally stop your economy dead? Would that be any worse than what the GOP tax plan is doing? What if all 300+ million taxpayers just didn't pay, next year? They can't arrest all of you. I don't know. I'm grasping here. \n\nI cannot fathom how commonplace this is becoming. I'm starting to feel like I'm the one losing sanity, because there's no way this can be so normal and regular.

The GOP needs to go down first, then dems can be force by the public to get money out of politics, and then we can slowly morph into a non party country that votes based on the merit of ideas over the \"team mentality\".

If citizens ever rose up **for real** *for real*....\n\nLook im sure the military and police forces would lose a ton of personnel to defection, but those that stayed would reap the benefits of being able to kill potentially millions of people, or at least hundreds of thousands, thousands, hundreds or even just 1-2 people *without even being in the same state*. Completely removed from combat, threat, danger. Meanwhile we all have guns. And theyre not even that great of guns when compared to military grade. Sure, a resistance well armed with defector intelligence could mount targeted strikes and try to disable/bring down the programs or infrastructure but theyd still have to worry about regular warfare against a more well resourced advisary.\n\nAll out armed conflict would not be the answer. It would *have* to be targeted hits on key people/positions in government, regulation, big business etc. Itd be like IRA or RAF type shit. And those not in the conflict would be against the \"terrorists\". Like your average suburb people. Youd be labeled an enemy of the state. Kill on sight. Youd be in hiding from a government that has all of the world on surveillance 24x7 and can monitor speech virtually anywhere. Itd be hell. But thats what itd take for us to get through. \n\nYou start seeing like FCC Chairs and DAs and Politicians and CEOs getting shot up in the street while driving or a car bomb in their parking garage...it goes on long enough, or it keeps happening despite perpetrators being caught or killed every time...if you instill that fear in these guys who basically do it all just to weild power and influence..you could really affect a change. \n\nItd be like resetting things. Resetting the table. Giving the people some clout again. Except youd never be given credit for it. People would forever debate your legitamacy, and youd be a murderous terrorist traitor in the eyes of so many, a hero to so few. Youd never get to write the history as they say, and innocents would surely suffer throughout the campaign, so your narratives will always be hyper scrutinized, but you would have done so much good for all of America and probably even the world.\n\nIt aint me, but I gotta believe these types of people are out there, and every flagrant, egregious abuse of power, every blatant act of corruption, its pushing them ever closer.

So in context, 'well-regulated militia' meant a militia with proficiency and access to necessary equipment. If you also look into US Code, you will find that the composition of the militia is broken into two categories, the organized militia (military and national guard) and unorganized militia (able bodied citizens) so throughout our legal documents it is pretty clear that independent minutemen and such were expected to always be around.\n\nThe key to this is that all the rights enumerated in the Bill of Rights acknowledge individual human rights that the government must respect. They are not a list of what powers the government can assert over the people, nor a list of rights the government gave to the people.\n\nThe Whiskey Rebellion is definitely an early example where the hypocrisy of the government really started showing through. However, the 2nd Amendment doesn't enshrine a right to have the government instantly cave in in the face of public resistance. Just that the people have the right to keep and bear arms in defense against foreign and domestic enemies of a free state, whoever or wherever they may be.",

That's why the notice and public comment period is so important in administrative law. A reviewing court needs to make sure that any new Agency rules are not simply created on the whim of those Agencies' boards, but rather are the result of careful research. This arbitrary and capricious standard applies to decisions by Agencies to enact new regulations as well as decisions to rescind existing regulations (Motor Vehicles Manufacturers Association v. State Farm, 463 U.S. 29 (1983)).\n\n>The court that reviews decisions by major agencies like the FCC is almost always the DC Circuit Court of Appeals. Presently, of the 11 current (non-senior) justices on the DC Circuit, 7 were appointed either by Obama or Clinton. It is not a conservative court.\n\n>Since the notice and public comment period in Agency procedure is so important for the reasons above, it's very likely that the liberal DC Circuit (Chief Justice Merrick Garland, remember him?) would find that the rampant use of bots and fraudulent commenting in that period provide substantial evidence that the actions of the FCC in rescinding Net Neutrality rules were arbitrary and capricious.

During his 8 year reign of terror and the degradation of our civil society, that he otherwise referred to as a Fundamental Transformation of America, Barack Obama schemed against capitalism and a free-market society. He committed multiple atrocities against the citizens of America and repeatedly attacked the U.S. Constitution and our God-given rights. Yes, this Socialist-Marxist fool and disciple of Saul Alinsky and Frank Marshall Davis (both Communists) created issues that will take America 20-30 years to overcome, and he knew exactly what he was doing and continues to do so. His 10 trillion dollar debt he created during his administrations will take an entire generation of time to erase. However, this was his agenda all along (right out of \"Rules for Radicals\"). To weaken America and its global position was his focus then and continues to be now as he is now very busy as a \"community organizer\". His identity politics will eventually lead to a revolution in America. All freedom-loving Americans are united in stopping this move. Hey, FCC, back down or Americans will have Donald Trump cleaning house at the FCC. Barry and his extremely racist family no longer live in the White House. There's a new sheriff in town and you folks need to be very cautious in attempting to move forward with this crackpot idea to mess with net neutrality. Now, are you also going to propose to mess with my 1st Amendment rights?\n\nApparently, the plan to repeal NN is an Obama plot because he's a racist commie and the FCC better back off or Drumpf will clean house.

Reagan did so much damage, and it's all down the memory hole in the internet age. Some of it is blamed on Democrats -- like media consolidation. Reagan ripped apart media regulations like no one before or since. Donald Trump is now giving him a run for his money.\n\nThen there's the weak, pathetic Ronald Reagan economy that finally caused a response that put Bill Clinton into office. Incredibly, Republicans took the Congress just two years in -- and for the first time since 1958.\n\nThen there's the son who stole the White House, and got the House in his support and the Senate split 50-50 even. 2001 was much like 2017 with deconstruction continuing, and quite a few protests too -- except the obvious difference -- September 11. Suddenly, we had to \"support the president\" because of terror.\n\nGWB and his party managed to hold the Congress for six years, despite all the damage they were doing. \n\nBy 2008, Republicans were thoroughly discredited. The Democratic candidate was a shoe in. \n\nBut then, we did it again (putting aside that huge issue of gerrymandering and election stealing, but let's just say we did not do enough). We put Republicans back in power just two years in -- the very same thing we did with Bill Clinton. This time, it was an \"outsider\" LARP that fooled some people.  The next six years, Republicans had an official policy of obstruction.\n\nPeople wanted change and all the dirty tricks pulled together to install Donald Trump into office -- election stealing, voter suppression, the outsider LARP -- you name it. \n\nTHIS TIME, people are far more willing to become active in pushing this cabal out. I am optimistic that they will do to Trump what should have been done to Reagan and then GWB. \n\nBut I am also concerned that people could forget in a mere two years. These people have to stay out for a long time like what happened with FDR. \n\n",
