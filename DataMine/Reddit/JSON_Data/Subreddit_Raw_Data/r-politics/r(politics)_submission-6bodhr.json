I was originally under the impression this was a move to get the idea on the floor, then force vote at next full session.  Seems it was more of a lone rep speaking his mind",

SPEAKER, I RISE TODAY WITH A HEAVY HEART. I RISE TODAY WITH A SPENCE OF RESPONSIBILITY -- SENSE OF RESPONSIBILITY AND DUTY TO THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE ELECTED ME. A SENSE OF DUTY TO THIS COUNTRY. A SENSE OF DUTY TO THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. I RISE TODAY, MR. SPEAKER, TO CALL FOR THE IMPEACHMENT OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. FOR OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE. I DO NOT DO THIS TORE POLITICAL PURPOSES, MR. SPEAKER. I DO THIS BECAUSE I BELIEVE IN THE GREAT IDEALS THAT THIS COUNTRY STANDS FOR. LIBERTY AND JUSTICE FOR ALL. THE NOTION THAT WE SHOULD HAVE GOVERNMENT OF THE PEOPLE, BY THE PEOPLE, FOR THE PEOPLE. I DO IT BECAUSE, MR. SPEAKER, THERE IS A BELIEF IN THIS COUNTRY THAT NO ONE IS ABOVE THE LAW, AND THAT INCLUDES THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. MR. SPEAKER, OUR DEMOCRACY IS AT RISK. MR. SPEAKER, THIS OFFENSE HAS OCCURRED BEFORE OUR VERY EYES. IT IS EASILY -- EASY TO UNDERSTAND. MR. SPEAKER, WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A PRESIDENT WHO FIRED THE F.B.I. DIRECTOR WHO WAS INVESTIGATING THE PRESIDENT FOR HIS CONNECTIONS TO RUSSIAN INVOLVEMENT IN THE PRESIDENT'S ELECTION. MR. SPEAKER, THIS IS NOT ABOUT THE PRESIDENT FIRING THE F.B.I. DIRECTOR BECAUSE HE WAS INVESTIGATING SOMEONE ELSE, IT'S BECAUSE THE F.B.I. WAS -- DIRECTOR WAS INVESTIGATING THE PRESIDENT HIMSELF. AFTER FIRING THE DIRECTOR, HE WENT ON TO LET US KNOW THAT HE CONSIDERED THE INVESTIGATION WHEN HE FIRED HIM. AND THEN HE TWEETED LANGUAGE THAT WOULD BE INTIMIDATION OR A WARNING, AN ADMONITION VERY STRONG TO-TO-SAY THE VERY LEAST. MR. SPEAKER -- VERY STRONG TO SAY THE VERY LEAST. MR. SPEAKER, WE CANNOT ALLOW THIS TO GO UNCHECKED. THE PRESIDENT IS NOT ABOVE THE LAW. IT IS TIME FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE TO WEIGH IN. MR. SPEAKER, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE A PART OF THIS DEMOCRACY. THIS IS A PARTICIPATORY DEMOCRATCY. THE HE AMERICAN PEOPLE DON'T PARTICIPATE ON ELECTION DAY ONLY. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE PARTICIPATE DAILY, AND THIS IS YOUR DAY TO ACT. THIS IS YOUR DAY. I'M SPEAKING TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. IT IS TIME FOR YOU TO ACT. IT IS TIME FOR YOU TO LET US KNOW WHERE YOU STAND. I HAVE SEEN A POLL THAT INDICATES THAT A MAJORITY NOW OF THOSE WHO ARE BEING POLLED ARE FOR IMPEACHMENT. AND I SEE ANOTHER POLL THAT SAYS A PLURALITY OF THOSE. WHETHER IT'S A MAJORITY OR PLURALITY, LET'S LET THE AMERICA PEOPLE WEIGH IN. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE SHOULD SPEAK UP, SPEAK OUT, STAND UP SO THAT WE WILL GET A SENSE OF WHAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WANT. THIS IS NOT SOMETHING TO BE TAKEN LIGHTLY. AND I DO NOT. I THINK THAT THIS IS ONE OF THE HIGHEST CALLING THAT A MEMBER OF CONGRESS HAS TO ADDRESS. I BELIEVE THAT THIS IS WHERE YOUR PATRIOTISM IS SHOWN, WHERE YOU DEMONSTRATE TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WHERE YOU REALLY STAND. SO I TAKE THIS STAND. IT'S A POSITION OF CONSCIOUS FOR ME. AND I HAVE NOT TALKED TO ANOTHER PERSON IN CONGRESS ABOUT THIS. EACH MEMBER OF CONGRESS HAS TO MAKE HIS OR HER OWN DECISION. THIS IS NOT ABOUT MY ENCOURAGING OTHER PEOPLE TO DO THINGS OTHER THAN THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. THIS IS ABOUT MY POSITION. THIS IS ABOUT WHAT I BELIEVE. AND THIS IS WHERE I STAND. I WILL NOT BE MOVED. THE PRESIDENT MUST BE IMPEACHED. FOR THOSE WHO DO NOT KNOW, IMPEACHMENT DOES NOT MEAN THAT THE PRESIDENT WILL BE FOUND GUILTY. IT SIMPLY MEANS THAT THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES WILL BRING CHARGES AGAINST THE PRESIDENT. IT'S SIMILAR TO AN INDICTMENT BUT NOT QUITE THE SAME THING. ONCE THE PRESIDENT IS IMPEACHED, THEN THE SENATE CAN HAVE A TRIAL TO DETERMINE THE GUILT OR INCENSE OF THE PRESIDENT. WHETHER HE IS GUILTY OR NOT GUILTY, TO BE MORE SPECIFIC. BUT THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES HAS A DUTY THAT IT CAN TAKE UP AND THAT IS OF IMPEACHMENT. I STAND FOR IMPEACHMENT OF THE PRESIDENT. HOW CAN YOU WEIGH IN? YOU CAN CONTACT MY GOOD FRIENDS OVER AT FREESPEECHFOR PEOPLE AND AT THIS ORGANIZATION THEY HAVE A PETITION, THE PETITION WOULD ALLOW YOU TO WEIGH IN AND BECOME A PART OF THE NEARLY ONE MILLION PEOPLE WHO HAVE ALREADY SAID THE PRESIDENT OUGHT TO BE IMPEACHED. YOU CAN WEIGH IN AT IMPEACH DONALD TRUMP NOW DOT-COM. AND BELIEVE ME, IF A PLURALITY OF THE PEOPLE ARE SAYING IT NOW, AND THAT'S THE POLL THAT I REALLY PUT MY EMPHASIS ON, THE ONE THAT SAYS PLURALITY BELIEVES THE PRESIDENT SHOULD BE IMPEACHED, MORE THAN 40%, I THINK THAT CAN GROW. I ASSURE YOU ONCE YOU WEIGH IN, AMERICAN PEOPLE, THERE WILL BE A DIFFERENCE IN THE ATTITUDES ABOUT THIS. I WANT TO THANK YOU, MR. SPEAKER, FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY. BECAUSE BUT FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY YOU MIGHT NOT HEAR MY VOICE. I AM A VOICE IN THE WILDERNESS, BUT I ASSURE YOU THAT HISTORY WILL VINDICATE ME. I ASSURE YOU THAT RIGHTEOUSNESS WILL PREVAIL. I ASSURE YOU THAT NO LIE CAN LIVE FOREVER AND TRUTH CRUSHED TOERT WILL RISE AGAIN. YIELD BACK MY TIME.",

Over the last week alone Trump has admitted to obstruction of justice. He has shared classified information with the Russians that might have even included info about an Israeli planted within ISIS. \n\nIf that isn't bad enough for you then let's move back to that obstruction of justice. He has fired three people working on the investigation, and admitted he fired at least one because they refused to let up on the investigation. That's not an okay thing, it's not a democratic thing, that's what dictators do. \n\nBut of course little Sean came out of the bushes and told you all that nothing had happened, and then Fox News aired it so all you dumb fucks thought it must be the liberals believing everything they see on TV. I understand why people voted for him initially. But at this point he is so blatantly incompetent at what he is doing that defending him just makes you seem like a complete and utter moron. When the president himself admits to obstruction of justice, you can't just sit there and keep denying it.\n\nBut anyways, go ahead and call me a sheep or brainwashed or whatever bullshit you want to use to discredit what I said. That's all his supporters do now anyways. Instead of backing up what they say with sources or evidence they just try to prove you wrong by calling you a sheep and chuckling to their other all white friends. Have fun at he next clan meeting, God knows there's barely anyone left behind him who doesn't own a confederate flag and a bumper sticker that claims Obama is in ISIS. ",

That is also why only rich peoples's interests are paid attention to.\n\nNow for my speculation:\n\nI think the last couple decades has been a little dance done by both parties where the republican president comes in and fucks things up really badly (Reagan, George W Bush, Now Trump), and the democrats wait till the republicans are hated and then run a corporate tool who while socially liberal, and fiscally responsible, just fucks over the middle class just as bad (Clinton, Obama).\n\nWhat I worry is that we are doing this all over again, but in a hyper compressed time line.  I don't want to kick trump out only to replace him with the democrats latest corporate tool.\n\nI would love to see all the republicans, and 90% of the democrats lose their jobs, and instead be replaced by people who will actually fight for the people.\n\n15 Dollar Minimum Wage\n\nPay Equity For Women\n\nHealth Care For All (single Payer Medicare for All)\n\nFree Public College\n\nPaid Family Leave\n\nPaid Day Care\n\nEnding The Many Wars We Are In And Ending The Military Industrial Complex\n\nMoving To 100% Renewable Energy\n\nTax The Rich/Huge Corporations\n\nRegulate/Break Up The Banks\n\nEnd The War On Drugs\n\nGET MONEY OUT OF POLITICS\n\nFurther Reading:\nhttps://youtu.be/QPKKQnijnsM\n\nhttp://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-echochambers-27074746\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tu32CCA_Ig\n\nhttps://www.americanprogress.org/issues/economy/news/2014/12/18/101790/as-income-inequality-rises-americas-middle-class-shrinks/\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckley_v._Valeo\n\n\n\n",

JEFFERIES: THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES IS A SEPARATE AND CO-EQUAL BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT. WE DON'T WORK FOR DONALD TRUMP. WE WORK FOR THE PEOPLE OF THIS GREAT NATION. AND THE EVENTS OF THE LAST FEW MONTHS HAVE BEEN DEEPLY TROUBLING. I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHEN WILL MY COLLEAGUES ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE AISLE, DECIDE IT'S TIME TO DO YOUR JOBS AND HOLD THE WHITE HOUSE ACCOUNTABLE FOR ITS ACTIONS. WHEN WILL YOU DO YOUR JOB? 17 DIFFERENT INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES CONCLUDED THAT RUSSIA INTERFERED WITH OUR ELECTION FOR THE PURPOSE OF HELPING TO ELECT DONALD TRUMP. BUT THAT WAS NOT ENOUGH. \n\n   HIGH LEVEL TRUMP ALLIES, SUCH AS CARTER PAGE, HIS FOREIGN POLICY ADVISOR, MICHAEL FLYNN, HIS FIRST NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR, JEFF SESSIONS, HIS ATTORNEY GENERAL, PAUL HIS CAMPAIGN CHAIRMAN, MICHAEL COHEN, HIS PERSONAL ATTORNEY, ROGER STONE, HIS LONG-TIME POLITICAL CONFIDANT. . JERRY CUSHNER, HIS SON-IN-LAW, TOP TRUMP ALLIES WERE HAVING COMMUNICATIONS WITH THE RUSSIANS AT THE SAME TIME THAT THEY WERE HACKING INTO OUR ELECTION, BUT APPARENTLY THAT WAS NOT ENOUGH. MICHAEL FLYNN, THE FIRST NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR, WAS DEMONSTRATED TO HAVE HAD AN ILLEGAL CONVERSATION WITH THE RUSSIAN AMBASSADOR IN DECEMBER OF 2016. HE THEN LIED ABOUT IT TO THE VICE PRESIDENT WHO THEN DELIVERED MISLEADING INFORMATION TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. BUT GUESS WHAT, FOR MY COLLEAGUES ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE AISLE, THAT WAS NOT ENOUGH. \n\n   THE ATTORNEY GENERAL TESTIFIED UNDER OATH BEFORE CONGRESS, AND HE SAID HE HAD NO COMMUNICATIONS WITH THE RUSSIANS DURING THE CAMPAIGN. IT WAS SUBSEQUENTLY PROVEN THAT HE COMMUNICATED WITH THEM TWICE , AT THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL CONVENTION AND THEN A FEW MONTHS LATER IN HIS OFFICE. HE EITHER LIED UNDER OATH, COMMITTED PERJURY OR DELIVERED MISLEADING INFORMATION TO CONGRESS, WHICH WOULD BE A MISDEMEANOR. EITHER WAY, HE LIKELY COMMITTED A CRIME. SILENCE FROM THE OTHER SIDE. APPARENTLY THAT WAS NOT ENOUGH. \n\n   DONALD TRUMP REFUSES TO RELEASE HIS TAX RETURNS. UNLIKE EVERY OTHER PRESIDENT SINCE GERALD FORD, REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS. WHAT IS THE PRESIDENT HIDING? WE CAN'T FIGURE IT OUT, AND APPARENTLY FOR THE OTHER SIDE, THAT IS NOT ENOUGH. \n\n   THE DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL, SALLY YATES, WAS FIRED BY THE PRESIDENT SHORTLY AFTER SHE WENT TO THE WHITE HOUSE AND REVEALED HER SUSPENSION THAT MICHAEL FLYNN MAY BE A RUSSIAN ASSET. BUT APPARENTLY THAT WAS NOT ENOUGH. THE PRESIDENT FIRED THE U.S. ATTORNEY FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK SHORTLY AFTER IT WAS PUBLICLY REVEALED THAT HIS OFFICE WAS INVESTIGATING ONE OF TRUMP'S CABINET SECRETARIES AND CLOSE ALLIES AT FOX NEWS. BUT FOR MY REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE AISLE, THAT WAS NOT ENOUGH. \n\n   THE FORMER F.B.I. DIRECTOR REVEALED THAT THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN WAS UNDER CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION FOR POSSIBLE COLLUSION WITH THE RUSSIANS, BUT FOR MY COLLEAGUES ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE AISLE, EVEN THAT WAS NOT ENOUGH. AND THEN THE PRESIDENT FIRES THE F.B.I. DIRECTOR WHO'S LEADING THE INVESTIGATION INTO HIS CAMPAIGN AFTER IT APPEARS HE URGED THE F.B.I. DIRECTOR TO DROP THE CASE AGAINST HIS BUDDY, MICHAEL FLYNN, BUT EVEN FOR MY COLLEAGUES ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE AISLE, THAT IS NOT ENOUGH. \n\n   THERE IS A CLOUD OF CORRUPTION HASING OVER 1600 PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE -- HANGING OVER 1600 PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE. WE ARE IN THE MIDST OF A CONSTITUTIONAL CRISIS. IT'S TIME FOR THE SPEAKER TO GET YOUR HEAD OUT OF THE SAND. IT'S TIME FOR HOUSE REPUBLICANS TO DO THE RIGHT THING. SUPPORT OR -- OUR DEMAND FOR A SPECIAL PROSECUTOR, AN INDEPENDENT COMMISSION. IT'S TIME FOR HOUSE REPUBLICANS TO PUT YOUR COUNTRY AHEAD OF YOUR PARTY.",

Gold is more steady than a stock index and tends to go up and down in swings, but not in spikes or massive drops. Stocks spike and drop because new breaks, such as earnings reports, mergers, or catastrophes. Gold on the other hand, when it moves, something tends to be pushing it. Usually its very good or very bad economic news, such as news against the dollar or jobs reports, and sometimes worldwide instability such as Syria. A move of 1 - 2% on no direct economic news is more interesting. I've been watching it, because I theorize nothing significant is going to happen until the gold index moves in reaction to something big.

Trump's very existence in the top echelons of our government undermines our country. He's a charismatic figure (to some) who can successfully keep millions of people in his frame against all reason, evidence, or good judgment. That's dangerous. He has a cult of personality that needs to be torn down because he is a dangerous demagogue. His political agenda is a separate issue entirely that should, in my opinion, be resisted.

The only reason they originally objected to him was that he was too blatant about what they wanted. And then they realized it didn't hurt his chances for election...\n\nI mean all Trump really does is parrot what he thinks they want to hear to get their base all riled up for him (the stuff their base is sick of the GOP dancing around but the GOP danced around cause they knew it didn't sound good to moderates/sane people. But it's pretty much what the GOP really wanted too... they just were more \"political\" about it). The only difference between Trump and the GOP is the GOP at least knows how to be diplomatic with foreign relations. And knows politics better so is going to be better about getting the crappy stuff they want done (the same stuff that Trump has been trying to go for... please don't think that he has any different agenda than them. Only difference is I don't think he cares if it doesn't make him more money so he'll just do what they want cause it gets people who \"worship\" him and he likes his ego stroked. And the stuff he wants also is stuff GOP wants cause they want to help the wealthy and don't give a shit about how it affects anyone else long as it is the best case for the wealthy).\n\nYeah, Pence is better. Only in that he won't fuck up our foreign relations and give secrets away to stroke his ego (and may not be a Russian puppet but at this point I'm not sure that there isn't more of that in the GOP than just Trump really). All the other stuff Trump does... Pence will want and will be more effective about it. So in some ways, he's actually worse. Just overall he is better cause well, that thing he's not the same as Trump (or may not be the same anyways) is pretty damned bad in itself.\n",

I'm gonna take a wild ass guess and say that its movement is a reaction to a particular reality that is taking hold in conservative circles:  That there is now a very real chance that this administration is going down.  Possibly sooner rather than later.  You know how right-wing radio and Fox News always have ads to buy gold in their programming?  This is because conservatives - particularly over the last few years of Obama - have been predicting collapse, and think buying gold is the only sure thing to protect them, economically.  Perhaps, the rise in the gold market is more of a signal that conservatives have lost confidence in this administration's ability to govern, and are buying gold to hedge against what they see as a possible forthcoming political and/or economic apocalypse.  It's pretty tortured logic, but if you consume enough Fox News, Rush Limbaugh, and Michael Savage, you are constantly being hit over the head with this \"BUY GOLD, it will be the only thing of value when the liberals destroy America\" fantasy.\n\nEdit: u/daivos is this what you are getting at, or have I completely missed the mark?",
