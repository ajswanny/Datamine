    "body": "Zinke's commander in the SEALS wrote the following letter:  \n\nedit: adding sources because people asked\n\nhttps://themontanapost.com/2014/05/30/his-former-commander-exposes-ryan-zinkes-navy-seal-career-and-defective-moral-make-up/\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/16/us/politics/ryan-zinke-navy-seal.html\n\n  \n*It is most unpleasant to write these words, as I have long considered myself a friend of Ryan Zinke.  In fact, he was in the first Basic UDT/SEAL (BUD/S) class to graduate under my command in 1985.  I remember him well and thought that he would have a stellar career.\n\nHe did have such a career until he showed a defect in his moral make-up, and the Left is already well aware of what he did, although perhaps not in so much detail as I go into.  They will, however, before the general election, so I have decided to anticipate them by providing this statement.\n\nThis information was provided to me by sources personally known to me and to those who were directly involved in the actions involving Ryan.\n\nWhat did he do?  Simple\u2014he used Navy (taxpayer) travel funds to make multiple trips from Norfolk, VA, to his home in MT, ostensibly to scout out training sites for his squadron.  The truth was that he went to work on some family property and, apparently, on one occasion, took two or three other Navy SEALs with him.\n\nThese trips not only involved airfare, but they also involved per diem and personal use of Navy time.  To his credit, Ryan, when confronted with his transgressions, admitted his culpability and paid back the funds he had expended.\n\nRyan\u2019s moral failings, in my opinion, do not end with his being separated from his SEAL team over the travel scandal.  His political career has some questionable acts associated with it, to include his creation (with some heavy-hitting New York and Boston lawyers and PR people) of Special Operations for America (SOFA), a Political Action Committee, back in early 2012.  At that time, I sought out Ryan to work with me in establishing an umbrella organization of Special Operations Forces from all the services.\n\nAfter looking carefully at the situation in which he was involved, I just didn\u2019t feel comfortable getting hooked up with what was clearly going to be a high-donor operation and possibly geared to Ryan\u2019s future political benefit.  That has turned out to be the case, as evinced by the fact that, almost immediately after Ryan declared his candidacy for the US House, he resigned as SOFA\u2019s chairman and was given a grant from the very Political Action Committee he established.  That, to me, is not \u201cconflict of interest;\u201d it is \u201ccoincidence of interest.\u201d\n\nThe account of what I have read about SOFA having its headquarters in property owned by the Zinke family that is across the street from the Zinke family home, further validates the \u201ccoincidence of interest\u201d hypothesis.\n\nAs a retired Navy SEAL officer, I also take exception to the looseness with which Ryan described his Navy career.  Depending on which bio one reads, he was \u201ca\u201d or \u201cthe\u201d commander in a certain high-capability Navy SEAL Team.  He was never a commanding officer and was bypassed for possible consideration for promotion to captain as the result of his travel transgressions.\n\nHe also has stated that former Cong. Allen West has endorsed his candidacy.  I spoke with Colonel West personally and learned that, while he spoke kind words about Ryan, he did not endorse him.  Subsequent to my conversation with him, Colonel West has made clear that that was not the case and will not be the case during the primary.\n\nHaving seen a heavily redacted copy of Ryan\u2019s DD-214, which is a summary of his military career, I noted that, unlike his claim to have received two Bronze Stars for combat, he actually received them for meritorious service.  Neither had the Combat \u201cV\u201d for Valor, which would have been the case had he earned the awards for combat.\n\nThe statement by a retired Navy SEAL Master Chief sums up the essence of Ryan\u2019s character.  The man told me personally that Ryan is PNG (persona non grata) at his old SEAL team, primarily for the misleading statements he has made about his rank and importance at that \u201cspecial\u201d team.  That is a sad commentary on a man who had all the potential in the world and has, instead of coming clean about himself and his mistakes, tries to re-write his personal history in order to achieve political office.\n\nI am certain that Ryan would have acquitted himself well if he had led his men in actual combat instead of being a theater manager of the combat units assigned to him.\n\nI am sure that Ryan will do his best to rebut these serious allegations.  He can prove me wrong by making his unredacted DD-214 available for public examination.  I would like nothing better than to have been shown that I was wrong, but that won\u2019t happen.\n\nWhy do I, a transplanted Texan living in NC, want to rupture more than one friendship over Ryan Zinke\u2019s candidacy for the US House of Representatives?  Simple\u2014Ryan\u2019s ambitions will not stop here.  He has shown by his dissimulation of facts regarding his career that he is willing to do whatever it takes to reach the next level\u2014in his case, the US Senate.  I cannot abide that prospect, because THEN he is representing ME and every citizen of this land as a member of one of the world\u2019s most prestigious deliberative bodies.\n\nLarry Bailey\n\nCAPT (SEAL), USN (Ret.)\n\nChocowinity, NC*",

At least there the company fully able to do the actual work and the only thing in question was the bidding process.\n\nHere we have straight up kleptocracy, giving a contract like this to an unknown company with two employees with ties to the head of the agency?  What the actual fuck.\n\nAnd from a practical sense there is no way that this is going to end well.  You can't go from 2 employees to 280 in a matter of weeks and hope to restore power to all of PR without major fuckups.  The infrastructure to run the company is not even there, let alone the capability to actually do the work.\n\n> Whitefish happened to be the first firm \"available to arrive and they were the ones that first accepted terms and conditions for PREPA,\" Ricardo Ramos, the executive director of PREPA, the island's power authority, told reporters.\n\nWell of course they showed up first, it's just 2 guys.  You choose who is going to rebuild your power grid by _the first guys that walk through the door_?  I'm calling bullshit on that.\n\n> Zinke's office said in an email to the Post that Zinke and Whitefish's chief executive know each other.\n\nYou mean Zinke knows one of the two guys in the company?  Nothing fishy there at all, nope, nothing at all, nothing to see, move along.\n\n> \"Everybody knows everybody\" in the town, Zinke's office said, adding that Zinke wasn't involved in the contract.\n\nI'm sure, they just _happened_ to choose a tiny 2-person company from the Secretary of the Interior's home town that he happens to know personally and that just happened to be in the right place at the right time to accept the contract without even taking any other bids.  Right, OK, nothing to do with it.\n\nThis should be a shitstorm, but I bet this is the only thing we ever hear about it.  Later today Trump will tweet something and we'll be talking about the goddamn NFL for 2 weeks again.",

For example my company had the experience and infrastructure already setup to do the job and plenty of employees to do it. The company that actually got the contract was 4 people in a tiny office in New Jersey that had been around about 5 years. Their only other job in the company history? A military contract they had another company do for them at a lower price.\n\nGuess what happened? They won the contract then immediately pocketed 25% of the money and then hired us to do the job for considerably less money.\n\nSo at the end of the day a job that should have cost the government $10 million cost them 15 and the company that actually did all the work got 8.\n\nTo top it off, the quality of the work suffered a lot because any questions we'd have about how to do something or on the nature of a particular building or area couldnt go straight to the DOD or CIA.

    "body": "Lolololol their website www.whitefishenergy.com is literally two pages (including landing page) and they've been around since 2015 with annual revenues less than $200k.  Seems like a legitimate and robust company for sure. *edit* [Wayback Machine archive](http://web.archive.org/web/*/Whitefishenergy.com) of their site since it's gone down. \n\n*edit* some additional digging. According to [this article](http://www.dailyinterlake.com/archive/article-476a16a2-c402-11e6-9e0d-d7bb58da643a.html), as of December 2016 a Brazilian transformer company purchased 51% of Whitefish Energy \"shifting the company's focus toward production of large-scale transformers for the U.S. market.\" Weird how less than a year later they'd be given a $300 million contract for utility repair work, i.e. nothing to do with transformer manufacturing. Another nice tidbit, then house rep, now secretary of the interior, Ryan Zinke personally intervened with the city manager of the city near where the potential transformer factory would be located to try to make the deal go smoothly. Nope, nothing weird about a politician going out of his way to grease the wheels of a deal for a brand new company from his hometown.\n\n*edit* According to [this reporting](http://floridapolitics.com/archives/246127-critical-puerto-rico-infrastructure-contractor-lacks-history-results), plans for the transformer plant fell through. So the biggest project undertook by this new company never got off the ground. This bodes well. (this source lists Whitefish Energy's annual revenue as $1 million)\n\n*edit*  this seems like some better reporting on the issue https://weather.com/news/news/puerto-rico-power-whitefish\n\n>Typically, immediately after a disaster, the American Public Power Association \u2013 a public utilities trade group \u2013 emcees a conference call with its membership \u2013 1,100 public utilities across the country \u2013 to get all the needed line workers and bucket trucks to the stricken area as soon as possible under what are called mutual aid agreements...\n\n>But the Puerto Rico Electrical Power Authority (PREPA) took a different route... \n\n>When the power association convened its conference shortly after Maria struck, PREPA told participants it wouldn't need the network's help because it had already contacted with Whitefish Energy Holdings, LLC... \n\n>The contract was reportedly awarded through a phone call placed in the days immediately after Maria hit. A PREPA employee who happened to have a satellite phone and phone number for Whitefish made the call, according\u00a0a story published by E&E News, an independent news organization that focuses on energy and environmental issues.\n\n>The employee had the phone number for Whitefish because PREPA had issued a request for proposals several days earlier to handle far-less-extensive damage caused by Hurricane Irma. It had grazed Puerto Rico two weeks earlier. Whitefish was one of only two companies to respond to the request, and so its phone number was handy after the power grid went dark because of Maria. But the timing left PREPA almost no time to vet the company.\n\n\nSo the people in charge bypassed the standard way of contracting out help because someone had the number of this 2 year old company handy and figured they'd do just as well as the established industry trade group. I hope the PREPA employee with the sat phone at least got a hell of a kick back for this corrupt bullshit. \n\n\n",

It's so goddamn obvious.\n\nEdit: Oh yeah, and check out this quote from [an article Salon put out](https://www.salon.com/2017/10/24/puerto-ricos-infrastructure-will-be-rebuilt-by-a-2-person-company-with-ties-to-ryan-zinke/):\n\n>The fact that Whitefish Energy is so small and obscure, and that so many other seemingly superior alternatives exist, has raised questions about the company's connection to Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke. ***White Energy Chief Executive Andy Techmanski admitted to the Post that he knows Zinke, although Zinke's office claimed that this is merely because Whitefish is such a small town, saying, \"everybody knows everybody.\"***  \n\nFuck you, guys.  The excuse for WHY you know each other does NOTHING to absolve the obvious corruption that's a RESULT *of you knowing each other*.  \n\n>The Post also learned that one of Zinke's sons had worked a summer job at one of Techmanski's construction sites with a friend.  \n\nHow nice.  \n\n\n>Both Zinke and Techmanski insist that Zinke's connection to Techmanski and the town of Whitefish had nothing to do with the company being awarded the valuable contract.  \n\nRiiiiiiight.  Because any other explanation obviously makes soooo much sense.  \n\n\n>Zinke has a controversial past that preceded his tenure as Trump's interior secretary. When he served as a Navy SEAL, Zinke was accused of travel fraud when he allegedly submitted travel vouchers for official duties when he in fact went to Whitefish to visit his mother and renovate his home.  \n\nFuck you!  How the fuck did we let this corrupt asshole into this job?  God, I'm so fucking pissed off at the state of our government right now.  This fucking administration is rotten to the core.",

Arguably Republicans can even participate by offering a serious primary challenger. The problems are that Republicans are highly unlikely to put up a primary challenger, and even less likely to vote against a Republican incumbent; and this solution is years away, meaning a lot more damage can be done in the interim.\n\n2: Put intense pressure on congresspeople (specifically, the Republicans who have been shielding the administration since before the inauguration) to hold the administration accountable. I don't hold out much hope for this because it would require both Republican voters and Republican congresspeople to put country above party, which they have a well established pattern of having trouble with.\n\n3: Vote the current crop of Republican congresspeople shielding the administration out of office in 2018. Again, republicans can participate by putting up new anti-corruption candidates. The problem is that while the House might be flipped into a composition willing to hold Trump accountable, it's a lot less likely the Senate would do so. The vast majority of Senate seats up in 2018 are held by Democrats who are already willing to stop the Trump administration's corruption.",

Then you look behind the curtain right at the top and see the small children being used as tools to keep the whole thing going which symbolically stands for  brutality and exploitation being the true driving motor for the system. \n\nThe outside stands for a completely different way of living from our current system. People are afraid of it, they can't imagine anything else than the world they live in. In the end their whole system breaks down and you have some Adam and Eve symbolism with the kids going out into the new \"world\" aka another way of living.\n\nThen you have other small symbolism like the workers being fed insects, alluding to modern diets consisting of fast food.\n\nThe whole thing is presented in a pretty simplistic manner and is highly marxist at its core (not an accusation).

The energy used to create a covert insurrection against the status quo should instead be used to rally the public sphere. \n\nThe wealthy elite aren't scared of V for Vendetta. They're scared of Bernie Sanders. Trump talks about him as little as possible because of this. Violence inspires fear, no matter the cause. Hope inspires motivation for improvement. \n\nI don't contend how satisfying it would be to have the avatars of corporate America in an interview room, but if we want a democracy, WE HAVE TO LEAD BY EXAMPLE!",

On one end the work takes a long time, on the other end you have a ton of scammers take on jobs, take up front payments and fuck off because they haven't been properly vetted, or worse they build shoddy infrastructure. \n\nI can give an example of this. In first year uni I became friends with a mature student who was auditing some philosophy classes for fun. Soon I found out he was loaded and he told me how. He would seek out natural disasters and bid on low level (under a mil) contracts usually involving the sale of glass. He would underbid, accept payment, and never send the glass. We are in Canada, and he would do this to places in the US. He kept it under a million for legal reasons I don't understand.  ",
