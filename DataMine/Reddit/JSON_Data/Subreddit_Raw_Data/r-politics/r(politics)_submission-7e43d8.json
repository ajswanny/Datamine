Trump and people around him do enough terrible shit that we don't need to manufacture more.\n\nThe rest of the headline is fair though since him being a \"family values\" republican highlights that he is a hypocrite in addition to being a predator.",

Most people would say they defer to a moral, Biblical law, but that's not really right, either. It is at least not completely accurate, because they do more to twist Christianity to their own beliefs than they do to twist their own beliefs to follow Christianity. You think Jesus would be cool with sex slavery, or even something as milquetoast as not supporting social benefit programs? [Fuck no](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+25%3A41-46&version=NIV).\n\nI think mostly, they believe in community. They take their morals from their local church pastor and the conservative talk show hosts and news anchors they listen to. It doesn't matter if those morals conflict with the Consitution, the law, the Bible, or basic human decency. Going against your community is much worse than going against any of those things. It is absolutely and unsurprisingly tribal, in the end.\n\nAs for why they *say* they support \"law and order\" when they don't actually? A) it's a lie that gives them an air of legitimacy, especially when what they want happens to line up with whay the law requires, and B) in their mind, \"law and order\" means \"harshly punishing people I don't agree with, regardless of the actual process of Law\".",

    "body": "This whole \"my family is X, therefore, I am X\" is such bizarro logic to me.\n\nI, nearly, dated a girl who was just like that. She was perfectly intelligent, reasonable, and rational in nearly every way. We had discussions on a myriad of subjects. Hell, she even gave me a hand on a couple of programming projects. \n\nThe things that broke the whole thing down is that, because of her parents, she was Republican and christian...and, would fiercely defend both to the death, employing as many logical fallacies and as much mental gymnastics as necessary until the opposing party gave up. Well, that and she had moved out of town for college...but, I digress.\n\nStill, it baffles my mind to this day how such an open-minded and intelligent person could have such massive blind spots and so much anger that even asking questions was perceived as a slight or that she would unquestionably defend the actions of a particular party just on the account of their party name.",

    "body": "I agree and disagree but everytime Trump or his buddies come out and do something illegal, racist, or unethical and she continues to support him made me think what side would she have been on in Germany when Nazis started rounding up Jews? Or even here in the states when you had people hanging AAs? There's a quote by MLK that I'm too lazy to look up by touches on this a bit. She's not necessarily supporting those actions but she sure as hell isnt condoning them. And imo those are the worst people in all of this. The passive ones who don't speak out against this shit. \n\n\nI digress but earlier this year I had a good buddy of mine who is also my coworker say \"yeah a lot of the stuff they're doing is shitty but how does it affect you in any way? Who cares?\" I was flabbergasted and angry and ripped into him and explained to him how fucking toxic that mindset is. \n\nLike sure my ex isnt racist but she sure likes to stick her head in the sand and pretend everything is going well if it's not affecting her directly. And let me be clear she's no racists or Nazi but it worries me that she doesn't have the empathy to be absolutely outrage at all the stuff that's been happening. It's things that are wrong for the basic of humanity. \n\nI feel like at this point we need to make people take tests. What's good: unicorns, happiness, diversity, equality, flowers. What's bad: evil, racism, pedophilia, super villains, dictatorships, Hitler, the devil. \n\nAlso when I think about all the blatantly stupid lies Trump was spewing when he was campaigning that she just ate up it makes me question her intelligence at the basic level. An example is the bs drain the swamp bullshit. It's pathetic how easily she got conned and apparently lacks adequate critical reasoning to not even have an inkling before all this mess that Trump and his administration are pieces of shit. \n\nHaving a Trump supporting friend is one thing (maybe) but a spouse or partner. No thanks. ",
