Things won't always be how we want them, politically, and you have to be active in making good societies while bolstering human wellbeing. \n\nIn addition, the press has to return to vigilance, and the public to think critically. Theses are skills that complement and refine one another. \n\nSo it's on us, people, to work to stymy people like Trump and his ilk. Legally, civilly - but actively. \n\nThese are the times when generations define themselves. And I'm not talking politics, left/right... red/blue.....

Northam was beating Gillespie by like 50 points on healthcare. They need to beat Democrats with policy. Running on white identity politics is a loser. This is an issue they can't just do a 180 on because they'll lose all the people who they brainwashed over the last 8 years. Republicans have traditionally polled stronger on the economy and if they lose the country with this tax plan, they are fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuucked.\n\nTrump being elected president is the worst thing to happen to the GOP since Hoover. \n\n\n\n\n\n",

Northam is weak on crime, weak on immigration, and as your lieutenant governor, Northam has driven your economy right into a ditch, and he didn\u2019t even show up to the most important meetings. He was always missing and nowhere to be found.\u201d\n\n>\u201cLike me, Ed is tough on crime and on the border. Ed will protect your family from crime, drugs and violence \u2014 something Northam will never do. And Ed loves the vets, loves the military, and loves your Second Amendment. With your help, Ed Gillespie will help make America great again, a phrase that I like a lot. Vote Ed Gillespie.\"",

Throughout high school, I was a Fox News watching libertarian who honestly had been manipulated into just being angry about everything. It wasn't until I got to college, that I became what I am today. Shout out to the University of Montevallo for that. It is the states only public liberal arts college, and as soon as you step foot on campus, you can see that it does not belong in Alabama at all. I owe my entire world view to the professors there. I was actually planning on leaving the state for law school, as I had received several offers from schools in the northwest, but my advisor convinced me to take the scholarship to a law school here. Rather than fleeing the state, I figured I could stay here and do my part to help steer us in the right direction. I honestly love the state except for some of the very vocal uneducated people here. I know what Alabama is, and I also know what it could be, and those are two very different things. Sorry that this turned out to be so long lol it's nice to vent every once in a while.",
