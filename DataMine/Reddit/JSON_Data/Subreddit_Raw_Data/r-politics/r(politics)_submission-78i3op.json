That weakness was apparent to me very early on, and anyone who looked at Trump and thought he seemed strong or powerful, well, the most generous thing I could say about them is that they are a very poor judge of character.  Strength, real strength that is respected on a national or international stage as opposed to a playground, isn't about how loud you yell or being willing to threaten people.  It's about convictions, keeping promises to yourself as well as others, and being willing to defend and explain your ideals even and especially when they are under attack.  If Trump has demonstrated anything, it's that he has no firm convictions, chooses vulnerable people and groups as targets, and will reflexively praise those who praise him, no matter the source.  He's the definition of weakness in leadership and this was transparent very early in his candidacy, and I would guess even before that.\n\n> \u201cWe\u2019re not here to simply mark time,\u201d the senator said. \u201cSustained incumbency is certainly not the point of seeking office, and there are times when we must risk our careers in favor of our principles. Now is such a time.\u201d\n\nI'm also glad to hear this coming from a sitting Senator.  I feel like most of the Republican Party would rather fly America into a mountainside than risk losing their seat, but in the long run they're probably going to have to fight either way.  ",

And Flake isn't retiring due to high-minded principles: his approval rating is at a dismal 18 percent with voters from his district, and he was trailing his opponent in the primaries by a large margin. He saw the writing on the wall. \n\nThe lesson is clear: at least for right now, if you're an R and you're loudly anti-Trump, Republican voters are going to turn on you.\n",

Basically, if he stays in, resists, and runs again, the odds of him being replaced by a nutjob are really high.  By not running again the odds of him being replaced by a nutjob are more like 50/50, since the race will be more open to multiple challengers and won't just be about unseating the incumbent.\n\n  \n",

I see it around me, and I think the pressure is mounting to call for Trump's resignation. Beyond the obvious problem of Russian involvement in the election, everything he says is embarrassing to even the most forgiving critics. I think we've finally reached the point where nobody can deny that he is unfit to lead the country. For myself, at my most generous I could concede that the GOP at least offers a necessary competitor to the DNC in absence of a more sane electoral process, which I hope will be improved upon sooner rather than later. All of that is much more complicated than seeing that Trump is devolving before our eyes. Maybe it's his age, maybe it's who he was all along, doesn't matter. Gots to go. Bye.",

She called me the other day to tell me she had enough after the Niger incident. Thats not to say shes done with Republicans, but she is done with Trump. I have several other Republicans that I know that are done with him as well. \n\nEach one of these things piles little by little. It is taking a specific incident of where the R voters draw the line. For my sister is was that, for others it might be Russia, for others it might be Puerto Rico, Health Care failure, his response to Charlottesville, failed tax reform, N Korea, the \"swampiness\" of his cabinet, for others it may be something else. \n\nThe thing that we aren't seeing, which is very different than \"normal\" politics is the big peel off for a huge fuck up. Think of the huge drop for W post Katrina, or 2005/6-ish with Iraq. For whatever reason a lot of the Rs are sticking to him. The Republicans have had decades to brain wash a huge chunk of the population.\n\nI think part of this, is that pundits are beyond done even attempting to play \"fair and balanced\". The News needs to mercilessly hammer him for every bullshit thing he does. As much as we are getting Trump fatigue, so are some Rs.\n\nA dozen or so prominent Republican politicians going after him not only harms him directly, it gives cover for Dems. What is aggravating as hell to me, is that the Dems are all but freaking silent. We ALL want the Dems to grow some balls. I'm really hoping that after this year they come out swinging.\n\nHis \"good\" approval numbers are in the high 30s. Sustained low 30s/high 20s is probably impeachment territory.\n\nNow..keep in mind, that moderates and especially the left are pissed, motivated, and scared. The Republicans know they aren't going to see the low turn out from last go around. The random elections going around the country are showing strong Democratic turnout, and results even when the ultimately lose. We don't have a great opportunity to completely change things in the Midterms, but a couple election cycles will be disastrous for the Republican party, and they are making lifelong Dems of a generation bigger than the Boomers.\n\nAnd we aren't even a year in. In all likelihood the Tax plan will go down the shitter, and we'll have another 2 1/2 months of Trumps bullshit before the year is out. It is also likely that the Obama economy is going to slow.",

When Trump shits on gold star families, he's just \"telling it like it is.\"\n\n2. On some level the understand that the gripes posed by liberals are entirely valid. This irks them, but instead of compromising, it's much easier mentally to just dismiss them as nonsense outright.\n\n3. They live in echospheres and refuse to ever engage outside of it. (inb4 \"hurr durr librul hypocrites,\" it's proven that not only do liberals ingest more news, but also from a larger variety of sources)\n\n4.
