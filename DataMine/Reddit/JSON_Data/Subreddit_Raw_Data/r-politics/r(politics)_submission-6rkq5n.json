I know no banks\u2014because of the recession, the Great Recession\u2014have touched a golf course. You know, no one\u2019s funding any kind of golf construction. It\u2019s dead in the water the last four or five years.\u2019 And this is what he said. He said, \u2018Well, we don\u2019t rely on American banks. We have all the funding we need out of Russia.\u2019 I said, \u2018Really?\u2019 And he said, \u2018Oh, yeah. We\u2019ve got some guys that really, really love golf, and they\u2019re really invested in our programs. We just go there all the time.\u2019 Now that was three years ago, so it was pretty interesting.\u201d\n\nOr that time in 2008 when Big Don himself said: \n\"Russians make up a pretty disproportionate cross-section of a lot of our assets. We see a lot of money pouring in from Russia.\"",

    "body": "A repost of one of my comments the other day breaking down exactly how lazy trump has been\n\n> I started breaking that vacation down into percentages. Assuming our baseline is that in the US the average employee gets 2 weeks off per calendar year (pulled from a quick google search) that means the average American spends 3.8% of his/her year on vacation.\n\n> Trump took office on January 20th which means he has spent 195 days in office as president, the 17 day vacation would amount to him spending 8.7% of his time in office on that one vacation. To be fair the first number is an annual average so if Trump only took this one vacation annually that would be 4.7% of his first year as president on vacation, which is above the average.\n\n> **BUT** we cant ignore all of the vacations he has already taken, exporting the time Trump was on the golf course from http://trumpgolfcount.com (we wont fault him for time off the course, despite the fact that he most likely wasnt working we have no evidence so we have to give him the benefit of the doubt) he has spent 12.92 days which is 310 hours (over the course of 41 golf trips) physically on the golf course playing golf.\n\n> So with those 12.92 days trump will have now spent 6.6% of his time in office playing golf (which would amount to 3.5% annually). So if we assume this 17 day vacation is the last vacation he takes in 2017 and add in the 12.92 he has already spent playing golf then Trump will have spent a grand (conservative estimate) total of 8.2% of the year on vacation, which is over double the national average. I believe its safe to conclude from my research and calculations that Trump is in fact a lazy ass slacker.\n\n> TLDR: Trump is a lazy fuck\n\n**EDIT:** Spelling errors\n\n**EDIT 2 Electric Boogaloo:** To answer all of the questions asking about weekends it doesnt include weekends at all for the average worker, but it does for Trump, I adjusted the Trump calculations to account for that though and including weekends as work days is to his benefit, he only loses 12.92 days of golf vacation (assuming he has only ever golfed on weekends) but loses 56 work days (56 weekend days since Jan 20) so the numbers shift from 8.7% of time in office on vacation to 12.2% on vacation with a new total of time off annually at 6.5% of the working year which is much higher than the average annual (this is only counting the 17 day vacation assuming hasnt taken any time off other than weekends since Jan 20 and wont take any more until Jan 20 of next year)",

We have Hades, who is essentially the husband, and we have the parents who perhaps had other plans for their daughter. Ancient Greece didn't have a tradition of bride stealing, but marriage was rather transactional with the father essentially handing their daughter over to their \"new master,\" so it seems more likely that they eloped without the mother's blessing.
