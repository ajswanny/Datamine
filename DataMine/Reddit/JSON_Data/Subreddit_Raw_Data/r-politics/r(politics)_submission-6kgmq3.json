Who knows if CFLs would have ever worked out, but these old incandescents, they've been around for a hundred years! And who are you to question it?

Donald held back Ivana's arms and began to pull out fistfuls of hair from her scalp, as if to mirror the pain he felt from his own operation. He tore off her clothes and unzipped his pants. \" 'Then he jams his penis inside her for the first time in more than sixteen months. Ivana is terrified... It is a violent assault,' Hurt writes. 'According to versions she repeats to some of her closest confidantes, 'he raped me.' \"Following the incident, Ivana ran upstairs, hid behind a locked door, and remained there 'crying for the rest of night.' When she returned to the master bedroom in the morning, he was there. \"As she looks in horror at the ripped-out hair scattered all over the bed, he glares at her and asks with menacing casualness: 'Does it hurt?'

It's almost entirely because of annual/lifetime caps. People would get sick, they'd spend until they hit the limits, and then get dumped by their coverage.

It was such a huge problem that Democratic Congressmen sacrificed their careers voting for ACA knowing it would cost them their seat in the next cycle simply because it was just the right thing to do for the country.\n\nAnd here we are, on the verge of rolling it all back.\n\nFucking unbelievable.",

A cost so huge, most providers straight up can't afford to do that, and would go bankrupt. The original ACA plan allocated funds to cover this upfront cost, so that providers could cover everybody, charge them the same monthly premium, and not lose any money because the government would absorb those costs. That really shouldn't be surprising, because a plan where the government pays for all your health care does eventually involve the government paying money to somebody for your health care.  But republicans didn't see it that way.\n\n\nMarco Rubio started a smear campaign and labeled this fund a \"corporate bailout,\" and he -- along with a highly republican dominated congress -- successfully managed to have that part of the plan completely removed, replacing it with their own version. In the republican-rewritten ACA, insurance providers were still required to provide for everyone, but the risk corridor funds were now virtually non-existent. This was now a plan requiring insurance providers to cover everyone, but with no backing from the government\n\n\nMost providers couldn't manage those costs, but since they legally couldn't turn people away anymore, they just folded. Remaining providers jacked up their prices *a ton* so they could cover everybody, and that's how we ended up with a plan where millions of people lost their coverage, couldn't keep their old insurance or doctors, and their premiums got much more expensive.\n\n\n**tl;dr** the part of the ACA that republicans shit on obama for is the exact part that republicans (led by Marco Rubio) wrote into the ACA, against strong protest from obama.",

I don't pay any attention to that.\"  \nPerson A responds, \"You should, you know.  It's barely less important than your own heartbeat.\"  \nPerson B replies, \"Oh, I don't pay any attention to that either.\"\n\nTo answer your question, Mr. Trump, thinking that the health care bill is not moving forward, is now threatening to take his ball and go home.  He clearly doesn't understand that the reason that the healthcare bill can't move forward is that too many Senators will receive pushback from their voters on leaving so many people without care, and that leaving even more people uncovered would receive even more voter outrage.  Trump thinks that it would be good to reset everything to \"the way it was before\", without realizing that the votes simply won't be there to do that.  He's really bad at this politics stuff.\n\nMeanwhile, the GOP is driven by their ideology that everything should be driven by the free market, without understanding that there are many things that don't work well in a free market context.  For instance, natural monopolies like electricity and water supplies don't follow normal supply and demand curves, which is why every state in the nation has a public utilities commission to regulate monopoly utilities.\n\nHealthcare is another situation where the free market simply doesn't work well, for many and complicated reasons.  Think about going into a hospital and needing a diagnostic scan.  The free market model would dictate that you get the scan from one of many providers, to minimize costs.  But practically, there are few providers and you are bound to a care facility, and not in the best mental state to make choices.\n\nSo, the GOP is bound to a mental model of the free market solving every problem, and simply have blinders that don't recognize that there are a number of cases where that mental model simply doesn't match reality well.\n\nI don't know whether this helps to explain the situation we're in, but it's the best I can do at getting inside the heads of Mr. Trump and his side of the healthcare discussion.",

It is supposed to be inevitable, irresistible, self-evidently good, and functionally perfect. They are taught from birth that this is true. Often times it is literally part of their religion.\n\nBut then they look West and see, to their eyes, a land of diverse, decadent, degenerate, immoral, liberals succeeding and surpassing anything they've been able to achieve. Which is not to say that California is perfect (far from it) but the disparity between California and [Kansas](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/sam-brownbacks-failed-experiment-puts-state-on-path-to-penury/2014/09/21/ded58846-3eb2-11e4-9587-5dafd96295f0_story.html) (for just one example) is manifest.\n\nIt's too much. Conservatism, unlike liberalism, isn't just a set of political beliefs which can be changed, tweaked, and negotiated. Conservatism is a cultural identity much more deeply rooted in a person's identity than liberalism.\n\nConservatism *has to* succeed in order for [their world to be just](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-world_hypothesis)--and if it can't be just, then the world might as well not exist. This, IMO, explains the political and cultural nihilism of the Trump supporter, who now cares for nothing else but making liberals angry.",

Because even under those harsh circumstances, *the risk is worth it to them*. \n\nGradients in anything drive fluxes to even them out; when there's a huge difference in quality of life across a very small distance between neighboring countries, that creates a strong driving force for people to do what they can to get a piece of that pie. One solution is to reinforce the boundary and maintain that gradient (i.e., build Trump's wall).

When all those people get kicked off their insurance, they will still seek medical help and will get it.  Then they will go bankrupt and default on their bills.  When this happens too often, the hospitals will either go bankrupt or start increasing prices dramatically.   Insurances companies will react by increasing premiums dramatically and reducing service.  So that jackass who is feeling smug because he has insurance might not keep that insurance.  This is what happens when you are part of a *system*.  What happens elsewhere affects you too.   The only people who will not be impacted are the rich bastards which lobbied for this.  They will still have their exclusive hospitals and plenty of money to afford healthcare.  ",

I've seen my Republican run state government mess with the local governments multiple times, passing things that invalidate or otherwise force the local goverments to abandon the progressive policies or tax raises they themselves voted for and implemented. They only want State's Rights because it's easier to pull fleece over at the state level (far enough away from local communities to feel beholden to them, close enough to not be as in the spotlight as the federal level) especially then when you consider gerrymandering implications. Also you still have that buffer with general wide sweeping state wide policies that make it hard to point fingers at what exactly is breaking down or being misrepresented (versus local policies which tend to have an immediate and very noticeable affect on the community). Overall, conservatives just don't care at all about the local governments and want to consolidate their power at the state level. ",

    "body": "> most laissez-faire economists still believe in the basic tenets of perfect competition.\n\nA notable exception would be the Austrian school.  They often argue that the idea of perfect competition is an academic fantasy - an attempt to reduce human action to something that can be replicated in a lab.  The Austrian position is that information is imperfect and often costly for market actors to obtain, valuations are highly subjective, people sometimes make choices that are probably not in their own best interest, etc.  In other words, real life is messy and we're all just sort of fumbling along trying to make the best decisions we can with the information available to us.  Here's an overview of Hayek's positions on the subject of perfect competiton: http://rationalargumentator.com/issue43/austrianmarketprocess.html\n\nEdit:  I realize that my wording made it sound like I agree with the parent commenter that \"most laissez-faire economists still believe in the basic tenets of perfect competition.\"  From what I have seen the concept is more closely linked with garden-variety undergrad economics classes.  Those classes use the idea of perfect competition as an idealized model that is useful in a classroom setting - sort of like teaching basic physics with frictionless surfaces, etc.  It's really not a thing that any serious economist (free market or otherwise) would suggest is reflective of real world conditions.  I get the impression that the parent commenter was simply erecting a straw man.",
