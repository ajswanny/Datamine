Instead, not unlike scientists, we have procedures/standards that are applied consistently to every source and every story. At their simplest, these standards are about cultivating an attitude of constant reasonable skepticism \u2014 that\u2019s really all the WaPo did here.\n\nIn general, the more serious the allegation, the more scrutiny a story receives. If I\u2019m writing about a parade and I quote people in the crowd, I\u2019ll take their names, ages, phone number, and town/city \u2014 just enough detail to verify that they\u2019re a real local person (and so my editors know I\u2019m not just fabricating convenient quotes from non-existent people). In that example, the stakes are pretty low. Worst case, the guy who said he loved the inflatable turkey float the best gave me a fake name or a silly insincere quote to be funny \u2014 annoying and worth a correction but not the end of the world. It\u2019s unlikely to change how my readers see someone or think about an issue. \n\nConversely, someone accusing a Senate candidate of sexual misconduct is going to be thoroughly, thoroughly vetted. The stakes are extremely high. The alleged behavior is potentially a crime. The alleged perpetrator is a candidate for federal office. It\u2019s not just a libel lawsuit you fear \u2014 your story could change the outcome of the election and/or permanently ruin someone\u2019s reputation. That\u2019s never taken lightly. Multiple editors are going to read that draft and say \u201chow do you know this? Who told you that? What evidence is there?\u201d A lawyer will probably review it too. There are way more people and checks involved in this process. The WaPo knows that a misstep on such a high-stakes piece would discredit not just that individual story but also the work of every reporter there. \n\nSo yeah, it may be true that the WaPo reporter\u2019s \u201cBS alarm\u201d was going off, but the system is designed to catch a liar like this woman _even when that alarm doesn\u2019t go off._ I\u2019m not saying journalism is perfect, but the chances a major reputable outlet would totally whiff on something like the Moore story are awfully small.\n\nSource: am reporter at large newspaper  ",

ACORN was involved with voter *registration* fraud, and *they* were the ones defrauded (or [not providing sufficient oversight](http://www.factcheck.org/2008/10/acorn-accusations/), depending on your point of view). Legally they had to submit bad forms and not just withhold registrations on their own judgment. Can't just say \"I don't believe you registered 'Mickey Mouse' to vote, that's obviously a joke.\" You gotta put it through.\n\nThing is, that type of fraud doesn't affect elections! Not unless somebody arrives on voting day as Mickey Mouse. And risks a felony. But in our nuance-free age, people just associated (with loooots of help from Fox / Limbaugh) ACORN = voter fraud = libs using brown people to steal votes. And thus spurred the whole voter registration movement even more.\n\nKilling ACORN was a huge win for the right. Slung so much shit, people (Democrats!) eventually said \"Wow this smells like so much shit, it must be shit. Better not have the appearance of impropriety, let's let them kill it off.\" Good job.\n\nGod I hate my party sometimes.\n\nHouse even voted to [defund ACORN *AFTER* they had already succeeded](http://www.esquire.com/news-politics/politics/a18694/house-defunding-acorn-060413/).",

For good reason, voter registration drives can't pick and choose what applications they process, so they have to turn them all in.  That means registrations that are incomplete, are filled out by someone that isn't eligible to vote (including innocuous reasons like being a green card holder or living in a different state), and any fake ones that a canvasser may have filled out to pad his or her numbers.  They know they have bad forms in the mix, but they still turn them in.  Most registration drives even turn the bad ones in in a separate stack to make it easier to process and filter them out.  ",
