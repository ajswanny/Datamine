For a history lesson: Thomas served under Reagan as chairman of the EEOC where he let the statute of limitations run out on over 10,000 discrimination cases, frequently tossed out discrimination lawsuits, and purposely did not meet minority hiring goals for the office itself. He was nowhere to be found during the civil rights movement, he had nothing nice to say about black leaders when he worked under Reagan, and he even rubbed elbows with South African lobbyists who defended apartheid.\n\nNaturally the GOP was able to sidestep the issue of being called racist by pushing forth Thomas as a nominee. Even after the Anita Hill testimony, which would have sunk and disqualified any other nominee in contention, the GOP double-downed and said Democrats were only attacking Thomas because they were the real racists. So they narrowly pushed through Thomas, who is now one of the most conservative members on the Supreme Court.\n\nSo to reiterate: the Supreme Court hasn't had a representative of the black community since 1991, and that is purely by design of the GOP, who did nothing but slander Justice Marshall's name and tenure specifically because of who he was and what he represented.",

But it was voted on a month before elections, and no one wanted to vote against a 9/11 bill, so it passed overwhelmingly. \n\nObama vetoed it. Obama vetoed a total of four things in his 8 years, it's not something he does often. With the returned bill, Obama included a note from him and the State Department explaining why it's a bad bill and why it would open the US up to retaliatory lawsuits and all the dumb damage it would do to our alliances. It was three pages long.\n\nMcConnel than overrode Obama's Veto.\n\nA few days later he realized it was a bad bill. He's not very quick I guess. He then blamed Obama for not warning them better about the downsides of the bill. \n\nObama can not win with Republicans no matter how hard he tried (and god did he try).

Traditional news media was discredited by the conservative (alternative) media, which basically told a large group of people exactly what they wanted to hear (think Rush Limbaugh). Anything having to do with social reform, minority rights, gun control, education, healthcare, etc. was treated as a liberal agenda that people in this demographic believed would threaten their lifestyle and idyllic view of America. This has filtered down to the voting base and the politicians pandering to said base to keep getting elected. The rational politicians on the right were voted out in favor of the Tea Party candidates who knew exactly what to say to win over their constituents. \n\nLIBERAL = BAD, basically. \n\nI grew up listening to that because my dad would have it on AM radio in the car every time we drove somewhere (unless there was a Dodger game on), and it took me a long time to accept the fact that not only was I a liberal but that liberal wasn't a dirty word.

They fall back on the GOP rhetoric because they make them feel good about themselves and instill pride. You see it some on the left but not nearly to the same degree. It's a tactic that's been used throughout the 20th Century with Reagan all the way back to McKinley at the turn of the century, but it is very effective at swaying the minds of the masses.\n\nI don't think we're going to see a massive awakening in the Red States. Education is key, but also access to credible information. It's getting harder and harder to decipher what is true or false in the media. A lot of it falls back onto the repealing of the Fairness Doctrine, which required news media to have experts on both sides weigh in on a topic so it's not strictly a liberal/conservative slant. NPR is the only news source to my knowledge that still practices that. If it is reintroduced, which could very well happen if nothing else than as a way to combat future foreign counter intelligence in our elections, it will educate and hopefully help enlighten the populace so they may be better informed. \n\n",
