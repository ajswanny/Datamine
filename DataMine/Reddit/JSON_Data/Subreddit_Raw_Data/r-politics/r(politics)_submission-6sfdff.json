But here is an [article from about a year ago](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/donald-trump-doesnt-read-much-being-president-probably-wouldnt-change-that/2016/07/17/d2ddf2bc-4932-11e6-90a8-fb84201e0645_story.html?utm_term=.67d9b946c344) elaborating that in Trump Tower reading articles about himself is just what he does.\n\nThe article is pretty revelant as a year ago all the suspicions are now proving true.  Even last week's Steven Millers \"common sense\" approach to a shitty immigration bill based on xenophobia. \n\n> NEW YORK \u2014 As he has prepared to be named the Republican nominee for president, Donald Trump has not read any biographies of presidents. He said he would like to someday.\n> \n> He has no time to read, he said: \u201cI never have. I\u2019m always busy doing a lot. Now I\u2019m more busy, I guess, than ever before.\u201d\n> \n> ***Trump\u2019s desk is piled high with magazines, nearly all of them with himself on their covers, and each morning, he reviews a pile of printouts of news articles about himself that his secretary delivers to his desk. But there are no shelves of books in his office, no computer on his desk.***\n> \n> Presidents have different ways of preparing to make decisions. Some read deeply, some prefer to review short memos that condense difficult issues into bite-size summaries, ideally with check-boxes at the bottom of the page. But Trump, poised to become the first \u00admajor-party presidential nominee since Dwight Eisenhower who had not previously held elected office, appears to have an unusually light appetite for reading.\n>\n> He said in a series of interviews that he does not need to read extensively because he reaches the right decisions \u201cwith very little knowledge other than the knowledge I [already] had, plus the words \u2018common sense,\u2019 because I have a lot of common sense and I have a lot of business ability.\u201d\n> \n> Trump said he is skeptical of experts because \u201cthey can\u2019t see the forest for the trees.\u201d He believes that when he makes decisions, people see that he instinctively knows the right thing to do: \u201cA lot of people said, \u2018Man, he was more accurate than guys who have studied it all the time.\u2019 \u201d\n> \n> Trump\u2019s approach to understanding complex issues and reaching decisions is not unique in the annals of the presidency. Historians who have studied presidential styles depict a divide between men such as President Obama or presidents Bill Clinton, George H.W. Bush, Jimmy Carter and Richard Nixon, who were given to reading extensively ahead of important decisions, and presidents Eisenhower, Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush, who preferred to have issues presented to them in short memos or orally.\n\nAlso, here's photos of Trump's desk in Trump Tower with magazines with him on the cover that he would hand out. \n\nhttp://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170127132729-01-trump-tower-desk-file-large-169.jpg\n\nhttps://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/12/26/us/26TRUMPORG2/26TRUMPORG2-superJumbo.jpg\n\nhttp://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170127132729-01-trump-tower-desk-file-super-tease.jpg\n\nhttp://cdn.newsday.com/polopoly_fs/1.11887390.1478716091!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/ipad_1536/image.jpg\n\nCompare that to Trump at about age 35-40 where his desk was actually full of work related shit, not marketing tools. \n\nhttp://www.nowaytrump.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Trumps-Office-Trump-Tower-1987.jpg",

The skill of the 21 century is no longer, \"how to find information.\"  Its, \"how to tell if its true.\"  This is not as easy when people are purposefully trying to deceive the public.

Taxes are bad.  Fuck roads, why should YOU have to pay for some road you aint gonna use?

He would get all the NY newspapers, magazines that might cover him and the like sent to his office first thing in the morning so he could go through their gossip/celebrity/society coverage to look for himself.  And it wasn't always positive, nor did he need it to be.  He just loved anything that covered him.\n\nOne thing he was actually good at was manipulating the press to get *any* coverage of himself, positive or negative.  He'd poke and prod Spy Magazine (the folks who came up with the \"short fingered vulgarian\" idea) with notes and clippings.  His \"beef\" with Rosie O'Donell was \"fun\" for him, even though she was accurately insulting him, because he knew it drew attention to himself.\n\nIt was always creepy that he existed in his own mind as his media presence, and that he wanted more people to know of him rather than that he was known as a good person.

As trivial and inconsequential as this gaffe was, it played perfectly into their hands, and heralded the shift of public perception of Romney.\n\nThe important thing to remember about political smear campaigns is that the substance is secondary to *resonance*. That is, it doesn't matter if the smear is trivial; as long as it resonates with people's prejudicial opinions of a candidate, it can be used to amplify those perceptions. And at the heart of every successful smear campaign, is a general perception of suspicion. Which is why, perhaps, the smears against Trump never stuck. The attacks were always successful in demeaning his character - not that he needed the help, but he went into election day with negative public perception, with even his supporters questioning the content of his character. What the Clinton campaign couldn't get to stick was *suspicion* of Trump, hence the 'tells it like it is'  schtick carrying him to victory, as Clinton, herself, fell victim to the kind of public suspicion that they tried to cast on Donald.",

That is: he saw the writing on the wall and figured it was better to use current leverage to pull the compromise to your side and take credit for everything, than to deny and delay and hand leverage and credit to your opponents.\n\ne.g. Nixon's EPA didn't include the Clean Water Act out of the gate. Which is a huge piece of legislation that brought most of the reforms we think of when we think EPA.  (That whole \"rivers aren't liable to burst into flames anymore\" bit.) What he actually signed was intentionally-watered-down.\n\nIf today's GOP were able to strategize like that (ya know, leverage reality instead of preach purity), they'd have pushed RomneyCare nationwide under GWB. It was still their plan (massive corporate hand-out). It still would've been wildly popular (as it is.) And it would've made Romney a lock for 2008.",
