The respondents warn there has beeninsufficient democratic discourse before deciding an issueso basic as the definition of marriage....The dynamic of our constitutional system is that individuals need not await legislative action before asserting a fundamental right....This is why \u201cfundamental rights may not be submitted to a vote; they depend on the outcome of no elections.\"\n\n**Ultimate Conclusion is that Same-sex marriage legal in all states and must be recognized in all states:**\n\n\"The Constitution, however, does not permit the State to bar same-sex couples from marriage on thesame terms as accorded to couples of the opposite sex.\"\n\n\"The Court, in this decision, holds same-sex couples may exercise the fundamental right to marry in all States. It follows that the Court also must hold\u2014and it now does hold\u2014that there is no lawful basis for a State to refuse to recognize a lawful same-sex marriage performed in another State on the ground of its same-sex character.\"",

Vermont that excluding same-sex couples from marriage violates the Vermont Constitution and orders the legislature to establish same-sex marriage or an equivalent status.\n\nMay 17 2004: Same-sex marriage becomes legal in the U.S. state of Massachusetts after the Legislature failed to take any action in the 180 days period given by the state's Supreme Court. It became the first U.S. state to legalize same-sex marriage.\n\nJune 26 2004: The Supreme Court of the United States declares sodomy laws unconstitutional, setting the legal stage for a series of gay marriage laws throughout the country.\n\nMay 15 2008: The Supreme Court of the U.S. state of California legalizes same-sex marriage in the landmark In re Marriage Cases ruling. The ruling took effect on 16 June.\n\nMay 26 2009: The Supreme Court of the U.S. state of California upholds Proposition 8, constitutionally banning same-sex marriage, but rules that previously officiated same-sex marriages shall remain valid.\n\nAugust 4 2010: U.S. District Court of Northern California declares that Proposition 8, a 2008 California-electorate ban on same-sex marriage, violates due process and equal protection clauses in the U.S. Constitution.\n\nJune 26 2013: The Supreme Court of the United States rules that supporters of Proposition 8, the same-sex marriage ban in California, lacked standing to appeal a court's 2010 decision that deemed the ban unconstitutional, thus legalizing same-sex marriage in California. Marriages resumed in the state two days later. The Supreme Court also declares Section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act, the portion of the law that barred federal recognition of same-sex marriages, unconstitutional.\n\nJune 26 2015: The Supreme Court of the United States legalizes same-sex marriage throughout the country.\n\nIt's been a 15-year journey.

The one picture i have from the \"ceremony\" and love it because I totally forgot to remove my sunglasses from my head.  I have the most wonderful memory save in that photo and easily recall giggling because when we got close to the repeating stuff I was surprised by the sudden onset of nerves - it was like my insides were filled with giddy butterflies breaking through a confidence barrier that was to break one last time to remind me to really understand that in just a minute i will be legally committed to this person and be accepting the responsibilities and privileges that come from signing the marriage certificate. A tear escaped as I was filled with the massive flood of brain drugs, the hormones that are released when you think about a person you romantically love.   The feeling I can only describe as being washed in a flood of love and blanked with love's warmth.  \n\nMy marriage license is a document that is kept with other important documents and was the legal recognition of a commitment I made to my partner-my husband...\n\nToday, the SCOTUS increased the value of that very official piece of paper and made my marriage more valuable.  It is a recognition of responsibilities, committments, and also a legal recognition of love.  I am so happy that who someone loves will no longer be a barrier for the legal responsibilities and privileges i got when I made a commitment with the man I love. ",

And to recognize a marriage between two people of the same sex when a marriage was lawfully licensed and performed out of state.\n\n**Edit**: Worth noting that Justice Kennedy has always had a sense of history. Today coincides with the anniversary of *Lawrence v. Texas* (6/26/03) and *United States v. Windsor* (6/26/13). Sort of bucks the trend for the \"real big\" decisions to come out on the last day (i.e. Monday).\n\n**Edit 2**: The opinion relies on two important rationales: marriage is a fundamental right which must be held out to homosexual couples *AND* it is a violation of equal protection to only hold out this marriage right to heterosexual couples.\n",

GOD HELP US! And forgive the idiots.!\"\n\n\" For all that are happy about this please go to church read the bible and then pray hard! Devil is taking over this world! God put us on this earth to be man and women not the other way around! Being gay is NOT okay! It's wrong and no one will ever change my mind! I'll pray for all of you! Such a sick world anymore!\"\n\n\" These are the people WE elect to govern our country and enforce the laws. I assure you they do not speak for me. And God calls us to love one another. I have no issue with gay couples. Why marriage? Call it something else. It demeans my marriage. Mary Menefee you are 100% correct and we will be forced to accept it because all people are NOT created equal. If we are offended oh well their rights count more than ours. Sad day indeed. I think we should all sue them because we ARE OFFENDED\"\n\nExcuse the grammar, spelling, and...content, they're all copy+pasted from the comment section\n\nEDIT 2:\n\n\" Marriage is a biblical institution to make this law is crazy but I will not personally marry a couple man to man or woman to woman in my church no matter what the law says....\"\n\n\" NO !: NO TO ALL GAY MARRIAGES . 5O STATES MY BUTT.. NOT IN KENTUCKY NOWAY .. READ YOUR BIBLE... HIT YOUR KNEES AND PRAY ..\"\n\n\" This is why our country is in the shape its in!  The Supreme Court should never be allowed to change a law that God created!\"\n\n\" I'm not here to judge because it isn't my place but I am going to express my opinion, the government is corrupt and god will have his turn with then....They have taken him out of our schools, took the pledge of allegiance away, taking our history, giving us this obamacare which eventually they will have us putting a chip in our Hands just so we can buy food gas ect. And I not u die, this is what is known as the Mark of the beast......this government is also what is know as new world order or something you follow this godless government if you choose, I choose to follow my father.......i cannot believe this has happened and its only gonna get worse.....if god was ok for us to marry same sex, why wouldn't have he just made us all one sex lol......his word says man and woman and to multiply the earth, Joe can you do that......may god have mercy on your souls......\"\n\n\" Its Gross! I can't wait till Jesus comes. I would of never had kids if I knew what kind of world they would be living in. This is a sad day. But we are to love them anyway and speak the good news. Not condemn them. PRAYERS\"\n\n\" Sad day in our country, changing the definition of marriage WEAKENS the institution of marriage and opens the door for further destroying the sanctity of marriage and a continuation of changing the definition.\n As a Christian, God's Word is over any government declaration,I stand firm in my belief and definition of marriage between one man and one woman, this is not 'hate' driven but a commitment to God's Truth. I  know this attack on the Biblical definition of marriage is from a determined enemy to undermine and destroy God's Kingdom.\n But His Word states \"...the gates of hell WILL NOT PREVAIL AGAINST HIS CHURCH\"\n\n\" So sad to see marriage dessicrated.\"",

There was a clear constitutional question here about equal rights and protections and the court answered that question. This wasn't judicial activism or judges overstepping their bounds. Their JOB is to overrule the legislature AND the people if either one uses their power as the majority to trample on the rights of the minority.

Essentially Scalia's arguments can be boiled down to: if the founders didn't think it should be protected, neither should I. \n\nedit\n________________\nSo a lot of the replies I've been getting to this seem to imply that I agree with Scalia's decision. Simply put, I don't. Originalism is an incredibly narrow and intellectually insulting tool of interpretation. However, people need to understand why Scalia argues the way he does and why he chooses the side he does. If you cannot understand his position you'll never be able to make any coherent argument as to why he is wrong besides throwing out misinformation and drivel.

    "body": "While I wholly support the majority's decision, I will concede that the dissent makes some good points, if you read it. It basically comes down to them feeling this is an issue that should be decided legislatively rather than through the courts. Two notable quotes from the dissent that pretty much sums up their thoughts:\n\n\"Today, however, the Court takes the extraordinary step of ordering every State to license and recognize same-sex marriage. Many people will rejoice at this decision, and I begrudge none their celebration. But for those who believe in a government of laws, not of men, the majority\u2019s approach is deeply disheartening. Supporters of same-sex marriage have achieved considerable success persuading their fellow citizens\u2014through the democratic process\u2014to adopt their view. That ends today. Five lawyers have closed the debate and enacted their own vision of marriage as a matter of constitutional law. Stealing this issue from the people will for many cast a cloud over same-sex marriage, making a dramatic social change that much more difficult to accept.\"\n\n\"Understand well what this dissent is about: It is not about whether, in my judgment, the institution of marriage should be changed to include same-sex couples. It is instead about whether, in our democratic republic, that decision should rest with the people acting through their elected representatives, or with five lawyers who happen to hold commissions authorizing them to resolve legal disputes according to law. The Constitution leaves no doubt about the answer.\"\n\nThat being said, I disagree with their dissent on the basis of not putting rights up to a vote. Still, reading both sides can at least help you understand where they're coming from.",

Here's some more recent data: http://www.gallup.com/poll/160058/majority-americans-support-roe-wade-decision.aspx\n\nNote that Americans support \"generally\" legal abortions in the first trimester by a ratio of 2:1. This becomes quite significant when you realize that ~91% of abortions occur in the first trimester, and many of the ones done thereafter are for life-saving and fetal development reasons. There can be no question that a clear and significant majority of Americans support the legality of the vast majority of abortions that are actually performed, even if they don't theoretically support abortion throughout pregnancy.

The lifelong union of a man and a woman always has promised nobility and dignity to all persons, without regard to their station in life. Marriage is sacred to those who live by their religions and offers unique fulfillment to those who find meaning in the secular realm. Its dynamic allows two people to find a life that could not be found alone, for a marriage becomes greater than just the two persons. Rising from the most basic human needs, marriage is essential to our most profound hopes and aspirations. The centrality of marriage to the human condition makes it unsurprising that the institution has existed for millennia and across civilizations. Since the dawn of history, marriage has transformed strangers into relatives, binding families and societies together. Confucius taught that marriage lies at the foundation of government... This wisdom was echoed centuries later and half a world away by Cicero, who wrote, The first bond of society is marriage; next, children; and then the family...\u201d There are untold references to the beauty of marriage in religious and philosophical texts spanning time, cultures, and faiths, as well as in art and literature in all their forms.\"",

The things that are happening now, even today in fact, were unthinkable ten years ago. In 2005 I hadn't seen a doctor in ten years. Being gay could get you kicked out of the military. Weed was illegal everywhere. Torture was an official U.S. policy.\n\nI oppose first-past-the-post elections as much or more than anyone here. I have personally won a campaign to change my hometown over to a ranked choice voting system (IRV). But that doesn't stop me from campaigning for Democrats under what is unquestionably a flawed system. It's not just about whether Barack Obama is better than Mitt Romney, it's also about whether Bernie Sanders is better than Barack Obama. Sanders couldn't have run in 2008 without Obama coming first, just like Obama couldn't have run in 2004 without Howard Dean paving the way for his campaign.\n\nThe only way we're going to fix this creaky old election system we have is if we stop thinking in terms of one election at a time. Look at the ACA. Sure, it's far from perfect, but it's something we can build on. Some day soon we're going to get a public insurance option. That only puts us one more step away from Medicare for all.\n\nPolitics is a game of inches. There will never be a situation, now or in the future, where we'll have one definitive victory after which everything will work out.
