Al )\n* if deals are cut for Ryan to step down just prior to impeachment we may have a president Orrin hatch R Utah ( Mormon ).  That's a huge stretch btw but the same source is that he is receiving daily transition briefings.  I still consider this the most unlikely in the rumor list.\n* you should probably expect another trump bombshell leak on Wednesday leading up to the real news item below.\n\nJust a fun aside: the mormons have a white horse prophecy that says when the constitution is hanging by a thread the white horse will save it.  Make of that what you will.\n\n\n\nNone of the stuff above is fact, or opinion based on fact.  Its It's rumor and gossip from twitter folks claiming inside sources that have had some successes and a few misses.  But quite a few twitter sources will have a make or break month.  If this pans out they will be rather famous.\n\n**real news**\n\nWith the fake news out of the way, pay attention to Thursday the 18th at 2:30est when the deputy attorney general who scurried to the hill to have an impromptu meeting with two senators ( pulling them out of live televised hearings on the Russia case ), will have an all hands on deck, all 100 senator meeting in closed session.\n\nNominally this is about the comey firing but that really is committee fodder is it not?  Mitch McConnell signed off, so it's a big deal because he doesn't do much of anything.\n\n",

I expected a raid on the NYTimes when he got the office.  Apparently that didn't happen because of Comey.  I still think that he's going to have Hillary arrested when it gets too hot.  I still think that major nuclear conflict is still on the table.  \n\nAs a kid that got pushed down the stairs a lot, immediately after winning a game of checkers or whatnot, I know exactly what he's capable of.  He's like Dad.  And Dad would punch you in the face if you even tried to win against him.  \n\nI hate to break it to you, but the more you back him into a corner, the more likely nuclear Armageddon is coming.  He's not above it.   He's not above saying \"If I can't be king, then you all need to die.\"\n\nLook, he just asked to jail journalists.  His second step is to see if he can get the NSA or CIA to bump off people for him.  He's not above it.  After all, Richard Nixon asked after seeing the newscast of Walter Cronkite saying Vietnam was unwinnable if he could get Cronkite killed.\n\nTrust me, Trump is no different than Saddam, Qaddafi, The Kim Jongs, or any of the endless strongman lunatics that have infested our history.   They get elected the same way, and they always have to be removed the same way... with terrible violence.  \n\nHe's going to refuse to leave office.  REFUSE.  And then he's going to do something rash.  It might kill millions.  He's a fucking lunatic.\n\nWhat's the evidence of this?  My personal life.  My father walks, talks, and stomps around giving people orders.  He makes his faces, and he makes his kind of declarations.  \n\nHe's the most dangerous man in the world right now.\nHe's only going to get more dangerous.  \nWe need him away from the engine of war.

Can some of them not even tell the differences both of those statements have? Hundreds of people are a part of the Trump campaign! \n\nIdk. Its both saddening and maddening. I see it in my own dad nowadays, so it just hits a chord seeing how easily some people can fall into being so polarized. To have such bizarre and cynical views of such a huge apparatus like the mainstream media is worrying to say the least.

It takes lots of small wins, not one magic moment of convincing them, and it's also important for us as individuals to recognize when we're not the ones who are meant to change their mind.  For example, a well-worded comment from a Reddit stranger will likely never convince someone, but maybe their son or daughter will help them see things differently because they are softer and more empathetic to them.  Maybe it will take that son or daughter 199 tries and suddenly on the 200th they finally get it because for some reason the context was different and it resonated with them.  If you're not the one that can get through to them, then it's likely that your attempts to do so are actually hardening them to the issue, and you may make it harder for their son or daughter to find that opportunity.  The real issue is that we all view each other as enemies from the start, so before we can have these discussions, we have to find a way to get to level ground first.\n\nSource:  My parents have always been hardcore christian conservatives, both voted Trump.  Dad still is but I've managed to get some small wins in our debates which has occasionally made him realize his source of information may be flawed.  After years of disagreeing with them, Mom finally asks me for my opinion all the time now because she knows I see things very differently from my Dad.  She does not approve of Trump's behavior despite being misinformed on many issues.  It's slow progress, but it's the dirty work required for the change we want to see.
