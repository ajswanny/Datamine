He did not reveal the specific intelligence-gathering method, but he described how the Islamic State was pursuing elements of a specific plot and how much harm such an attack could cause under varying circumstances. Most alarmingly, officials said, Trump revealed the city in the Islamic State\u2019s territory where the U.S. intelligence partner detected the threat.\n\n-\n\n> The identification of the location was seen as particularly problematic, officials said, because Russia could use that detail to help identify the U.S. ally or intelligence capability involved. Officials said the capability could be useful for other purposes, possibly providing intelligence on Russia\u2019s presence in Syria. Moscow would be keenly interested in identifying that source and perhaps disrupting it.\n\n-\n\n> \u201cRussia could identify our sources or techniques,\u201d the senior U.S. official said.\n\n-\n\nSo Trump didn't directly disclose sources or methods... but gave away enough info that the Russians could figure it out.",

I see no evidence yet that this did occur, or that any of the claims made have been corroborated. It wouldn't be the first fabricated hit piece to come out from the Washington Post.\n\nRegarding that last assertion, I'm not sure I agree; the statement from McMaster, the way I read it, only qualifies what wasn't shared.  From the article (emphasis mine):\n> \u201cThe president and the foreign minister reviewed common threats from terrorist organizations to include threats to aviation,\u201d said H.R. McMaster, the national security adviser, who participated in the meeting. \u201cAt no time were any **intelligence sources** or **methods** discussed, and no **military operations** were disclosed that were not already known publicly.\u201d",

This new disclosure comes one week after Trump fired FBI Director James Comey who was in the midst of an investigation of possible Trump campaign collusion with the Russian government in the recent election. All of this makes it vitally important that Trump make public any recordings he has of conversations in the Oval Office.

He has yet to receive punishment. Decency? Honesty? The Constitution? Nothing matters anymore. US politics has become *trivial*, a game of pure partisan savagery where scoring points for your team and bending the rules to your benefits are all that matters. The greater good? Forget about it. Politics has become the Hunger Games.",

[Buzzfeed is reporting](https://www.buzzfeed.com/jimdalrympleii/trump-highly-classified-information-russians?utm_term=.eqjRDGWEJV#.wkpJ5vRN7G):\n\n>Two US officials who were briefed on Trump\u2019s disclosures last week confirmed to BuzzFeed News the veracity of the Post report, with one official noting that \u201cit\u2019s far worse than what has already been reported.\u201d\n\nKeep in mind. Russian press was invited. American press was excluded. They probably had audio/video of this for a week over in the Kremlin. Our \"free\" press was kept in the dark until these leaks to WaPo.\n\nOk, one last edit - for the people telling me the WH/McMaster have denied and claimed it is false. McMaster just gave a 60 second press conference, denied sharing \"sources and methods,\" and left without taking any questions. WaPo didn't claim he gave \"sources and methods,\" it reported that he gave them the actual classified underlying Intel. Many IC commentators making their rounds on the news have been saying that with this information, Russia could easily determine their sources and methods.",

This is what he had to say:\n\n>He went on, \u201cI genuinely believe that if Trump wins and gets the nuclear codes there is an excellent possibility it will lead to the end of civilization.\u201d\n\n>If he were writing \u201cThe Art of the Deal\u201d today, Schwartz said, it would be a very different book with a very different title. Asked what he would call it, he answered, \u201cThe Sociopath.\u201d\n\n>And that is that it\u2019s impossible to keep him focussed on any topic, other than his own self-aggrandizement, for more than a few minutes, and even then\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. \u201d Schwartz trailed off, shaking his head in amazement. He regards Trump\u2019s inability to concentrate as alarming in a Presidential candidate. \u201cIf he had to be briefed on a crisis in the Situation Room, it\u2019s impossible to imagine him paying attention over a long period of time,\u201d he said.\n\n>But Schwartz believes that Trump\u2019s short attention span has left him with \u201ca stunning level of superficial knowledge and plain ignorance.\u201d He said, \u201cThat\u2019s why he so prefers TV as his first news source\u2014information comes in easily digestible sound bites.\u201d\n\n> He added, \u201cI seriously doubt that Trump has ever read a book straight through in his adult life.\u201d During the eighteen months that he observed Trump, Schwartz said, he never saw a book on Trump\u2019s desk, or elsewhere in his office, or in his apartment.\n\n>There was not a single call that Trump deemed too private for Schwartz to hear. \u201cHe loved the attention,\u201d Schwartz recalls. \u201cIf he could have had three hundred thousand people listening in, he would have been even happier.\u201d\n\n>Lying is second nature to him,\u201d Schwartz said. \u201cMore than anyone else I have ever met, Trump has the ability to convince himself that whatever he is saying at any given moment is true, or sort of true, or at least\u00a0ought\u00a0to be true.\u201d\u00a0\n\n>Schwartz wrote, \u201cTrump stands for many of the things I abhor: his willingness to run over people, the gaudy, tacky, gigantic obsessions, the absolute lack of interest in anything beyond power and money.\u201d\n\n>Schwartz says of Trump, \u201cHe\u2019d like people when they were helpful, and turn on them when they weren\u2019t. It wasn\u2019t personal. He\u2019s a transactional man\u2014it was all about what you could do for him.\u201d\n\n>If Trump is elected President, he warned, \u201cthe millions of people who voted for him and believe that he represents their interests will learn what anyone who deals closely with him already knows\u2014that he couldn\u2019t care less about them.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nhttp://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/07/25/donald-trumps-ghostwriter-tells-all\n",
