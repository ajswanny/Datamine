I am ignorant on this subject.\n\n* Why are private prisons bad?\n\nI get the main answer is that any prison that depends on an incarceration rate to make money = a bad conflict of interest (or rather, it's more about profit and not justice).\n\nBut why does private prisons have anything to do with incarceration rates? Isn't that up to the courts to determine incarceration? And if so, how are they connected to private prisons (in terms of making profit). I would think private prisons would have nothing to do with that. That they only serve to build the prisons,'and then maintain it.\n\nI think I read about how inmates are used for cheap labor. Is that a main way that private prisons make money? And if that's a problem, why not regulate or have regulations that have to be met for private prisons?\n\n* Are private prisons operating on a free market, in terms of bidding and competition?\n\nI know free market isn't the solution to everything. But take for instance the TSA vs private companies that bid to do airport security. Due to competition, private organizations were far better then TSA. They had more qualified workers. They actually caught more stuff. Lines moved quicker. Workers had an incentive to do a better job.\n\nSo why isn't this true for Private Prisons as well? Does private Prisons not have real competition and bidding for contracts? Or is that not how it works?\n\nLastly\n\n* If we don't use private prisons, does it then default back to gov funded?\n\nIf that's the case, do they not also have problems? A lot of gov programs in my state are a bloated  bureaucratic mess. Would they not also have the same problems with prisons? Look at how poorly the TSA is run. \n\n**I apologize for my ignorance. I'm actually liberal, but never fully understood why private prisons were a bad thing. I appreciate anyone willing to explain to me why they are bad. And I think it would help others that are also ignorant on the subject. I honestly just don't know.**\n\n**I also don't get why there isn't regulation put on private prisons. Like why the gov doesn't set rules and standards that must be met. Although if the main problem involves incarceration, then nvm**",

    "body": "Waiting for Gary Johnson shills...\n\n**Edit:** Ah, they've arrived. Context, yesterday's thread on [Gary Johnson and legal marijuana](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/4y6uaz/gary_johnson_right_that_most_americans_back_legal/) wherein I and other users were hounded for claiming that private prisons in the Libertarian model would be the undoing of all the progress we'd make in the justice system by decriminalizing. Their argument: \"Less law = less people behind bars, so private prisons are ok\" as if law count and prisoner count have a positive correlation, and as if private prisons wouldn't be looking for every excuse to profit.

All of the evidence I've seen suggests that deregulating markets just makes them easier to manipulate and reduce competition. Capitalism is a fantastic system but it needs strong regulation and enforcement of laws preventing anti-competitive action, otherwise a few powerful players will consolidate and act to eliminate any competition they face the same way a mob racket ensures profits by eliminating competition. Ensuring that you have no competition is always safer and less risky than attempting to develop the best possible product\n\nFor example, look at the [Telecom Act of 1996](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecommunications_Act_of_1996). It introduced a controversial piece of deregulation that allowed for media cross-ownership (i.e. a single person or company can own a cable TV company, a newspaper, and a radio station, etc). This immediately led to massive consolidation, because competition is more expensive than simply merging with all of your competitors. Before 1996 there were nearly 60 companies that controlled 90% of the media outlets in the US. [Today that number has dwindled to 6 (and would have been 5 if Comcast and Time Warner were allowed to merge)](http://frankwbaker.com/The%20big%20picture.jpg).\n\n>America was built on the free market with limited government control\n\nHonestly that's simply wrong, the greatest period of economic growth in the history of America occurred between 1938 and 1960 as a result of aggressive enforcement of anti-trust laws and application of Keynesian theories by the federal government. Deregulation and the neoliberal concept of \"limited government\" is a relatively new phenomenon that emerged as a response to the oil crises of the 1970s.",

A private prison cannot, and therefore must perform well at its duty.",

    "body": "Good question, and that's where it gets tricky for me. [Take a look at the top countries in terms of health care systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization_ranking_of_health_systems_in_2000). Most of them have a multi-tier system, with both private and public options. In the US, we have I believe 28 of the top 50 hospitals in the world, the best medical researchers in the world, and we dominate the pharmaceutical industry. I truly believe that a big reason for this is due to the privatization of our medical industry. Restructuring our health care system to include a public option is something I'd support, but I'm against single-payer system because it will hinder the thriving medical industry we have here. A multi-tier system appears to be the ideal one.\n\nSource: I am currently an engineering intern at a medical software company, and we hear from doctors all the time. This is usually what we end up hearing.",

You are gonna have one show up, and you are gonna pay whatever they decide to charge you.  Likewise with prisons, people don't get a choice what prison they get sent to.  You can make various arguments about not committing a crime in the first place, but that's moot.  Once something happens, you have no choice in shopping around, and as such there are no market pressures.  And where do private prisons get money?  From the government!  The government pays them what it would cost them to house the inmate, and the private prison makes a profit by spending less.  Usually by feeding shittier food and such.",

This means that their main goal is to get as many prisoners in the door as possible and hold them for the most amount of time. They use their profits to lobby for stricter laws so that more prisoners are produced by the justice system. They use their profits to lobby against laws that would reduce the prison population, for example decriminalizing marijuana.\n\nA non-profit prison has no such motivation, nor do they have profits with which to lobby.\n\n(This is a simplification, but addresses your comment.)",
