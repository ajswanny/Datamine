This makes Kushner a foreign agent. This is treason.\n\nEDIT: I got a reply saying \"You have to be in a state of war\", which is what I was alluding to in the first part of this comment. However, I think that this is an outdated definition of war that is predicated upon the idea of a state of war being declared, and weapons being involved. Clearly Russia and America are not at war, but there is a cyberwar going on, and Kushner is an American who was, and is, firmly on the side of the Russians.",

Before the President was impeached for lying about an affair with his wife?  Or before the President conveniently didn't recall any knowledge about the CIA under his administration and a faction within the military selling arms to a country who we had issued a full trade sanction and then used the money from *that* transaction to fund a secret war in Nicaragua by means of highly brutal death squads?  Perhaps you mean before the nuclear Cold War against an adversary that stockpiled more nuclear warheads than we did?  Or when Europe was literally divided down the middle with a border where you'll get shot for crossing without permission?  How about before Watergate?  Before Vietnam?  Before the President was assassinated and we still argue over why it happened?  Before we issued a stalemate with North Korea?  How far back do you want to go?  Before we emancipated slavery but still an enormous percentage of Americans of European ancestry refused to welcome the newly free people into society for over a century and a half?  Or how about when there was indeed slavery of human men, women and children in this country?  Or the government-supported genocide of the Native American because of the contrived concept of \"Manifest Destiny\"?\n\n***Of course I'm belaboring the point, but here's why:***\n\nAlmost every one of us, including myself, has fallen for this concept of things being \"normal\" at one point in our lives, which is *always, always, ALWAYS* when we're younger and not yet hip to the context of current events.\n\nYou see the very same thing happen (quite embarrassingly, for them) to Baby Boomers who watch Fox News when they talk about how decades ago, people used to exercise better manners and -- my personal favorite -- had more courage than people do today, including grown-ups.  But if you look back, I don't think white people pouring bleach into a swimming pool because they don't like black people swimming there is a am exercise of good manners; do you?  I don't consider unnecessarily waging a two-front war (Afghanistan/Iraq) that they're too old to fight and this force the younger generations to take on the responsibility to be a case of exercising bravery; do you?  And these are just examples off the top of my head.\n\nTo summarize, what you're describing as \"normal\" is just an illusion that likely everyone has at some point in their life, because we can't help but be ignorant to the urgency of current events when we're too young to understand what is going on.  Now that you're hip to it, I'll oblige the popular statement: the only thing necessary for evil to exist is for good people to do nothing.",
