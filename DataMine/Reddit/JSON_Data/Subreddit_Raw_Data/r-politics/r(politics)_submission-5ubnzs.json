    "body": "It's noteworthy that, while making the case that Trump is unfit to serve, they didn't even mention Trump's fiasco in Yemen.  Let's go over that one again.\n\nThe Obama administration had been contemplating a raid in Yemen.  To gather intel?  To capture or kill an ISIS leader?  Who knows.  They never committed to executing the raid because they determined it was too dangerous.\n\nTrump becomes the (p)Resident and some knucklehead in his administration convinces him to go for it.  Aaaaaaaaaaaand it proved to be too dangerous.\n\n* A U.S. Navy Seal was killed during the raid.\n\n* 23 civilians were killed, including women and children.\n\n* U.S. servicemen were injured during the raid.\n\n* A 75 Million Dollar U.S. aircraft was destroyed.  In fact, it had to be destroyed by the U.S. military, meaning, we paid for the missile used to destroy our own $75 million aircraft.  *Awesome!?*  ...oh, hell no.\n\nShortly after the raid, a press conference was scheduled to show off a key piece of intel gathered during the raid.  A video.  It was quickly debunked as being at least 10 years old and already available on the goddamn mother fucking internet.\n\nFor me, the most amazing aspect of the raid in Yemen is that Trump didn't even go to the situation room to be briefed before approving the raid.  What was Trumple Thinskin so busy doing that he couldn't be thoroughly briefed in order to make the best possible decision?\n\n**...He was eating.**\n\nAnd here's a question nobody seems to have asked about the Yemen raid: Who actually WAS in the Situation Room for the Yemen raid?  Was it Skeletor himself, Steve Bannon?\n\nThere's a lot of talk about Trump being a Russian Puppet, but there's more than one hand up that clown's ass making his fish faced mouth move.  Trump is just as much Bannon's puppet, and lives have already been lost because of it.\n\nEdited to add another piece of fallout from the botched Yemen raid:  **Yemen has withdrawn permission for U.S. antiterror ground missions**, which could prove to be a costly consequence, making it harder for the U.S. to go after ISIS in Yemen.",

    "body": "Something that'd be kind of grimly amusing if we weren't in such a dark place right now as a nation:\n\nI work at a public library, and we keep \"new\" non-fiction titles in the \"new\" section for five months (or longer, depending on how popular the title is), before putting said titles into the general circulating collection.\n\nOn our \"new\" non-fiction shelf right now there are six books, published before the election, that are essentially anti-Clinton screeds. (There are no anti-Trump screeds in the \"new\" section, in case you were wondering.) On the dustjackets they copywriters bray on about how \"dangerous\" Clinton would be as President. The one I'm looking at right now, \"Guilty as Sin,\" by Edward Klein, has a picture of a scowling HRC on the front cover and *a quote from Donald Trump on the fucking back cover, promoting the book.* \n\nThe dustjacket also claims to list the \"crimes\" and \"scandals\" that HRC was supposedly guilty of, but they're so fucking *tame* compared to what we're going through right now - and ironically, one of the supposed \"crimes\" HRC committed was \"mishandling of classified information.\" The author even freaks out about (direct quote) \"The shocking extent of the e-mail scandal - potential blackmail of the next president of the United States by foreign governments.\" \n\nAnother on the list: \"How the biggest scandal since Watergate is likely to affect the outcome of the presidential election.\" \n\nInside the book, Klein worries and frets over James Comey *not* going ahead with an investigation into HRC's \"mishandling of classified information\" in July of 2016, implying that Comey was an HRC/Obama stooge.\n\nI keep reading through this book wondering when I'll get to a part that actually describes in specifics and real detail what supposed \"crimes\" HRC committed that would make her unqualified to be president, and instead I just keep seeing stuff that *hints* at how shady Bill Clinton (he never refers to him as anything other than \"Bill\") is - and *Bill wasn't fucking running for President.* Klein never actually seems to get down to the nitty-gritty of what HRC was \"guilty as sin\" of, he just feints and hints and drops innuendos. He keeps calling her \"crooked\" but never says *why*. \n\nBut the whole case against HRC for President, and the case that Klein and Trump's supporters seemed to go on and on about -- mishandling classified info, clouding with the US's \"enemies,\" pay to play, lying (OH! The waterfall of words the right's writers have spilled about how much Bill and Hillary \"lie\" and not a fucking *syllable* about how much Trump lies!), \"crooked\"ness -- *holy fuck, turns out Trump is WAY more \"guilty as sin\" of these crimes than the subject of his fucking book.*\n\nHow much you wanna bet Klein writes a book that skewers Trump for the crimes he thinks Clinton committed? I would not wager a cent.\n\nAnyways, it's kind of head-shakingly odd to see all of these anti-Clinton books still on my library's shelves, gathering dust, all of them feverishly describing the hellish nightmare that would await us if we made the mistake of electing Clinton, compared to reading the headlines the last few weeks.

When he doesn't like an article about himself, he attacks the publication. He is a compulsive liar and a malignant narcissist. He is waging war against ALL media so now everyone is confused.

Good heavens he's only been in office a month. These protestors funded by Soros, who I might add was thrown out of several European countries, is funding all of these protests. He, funded Obamas presidential campaign along with other communist leaders in Chicago. So, I wonder how anyone could support Obama with his horrific background supported by this evil man that turned on his own Jewish people. However, I wasn't protesting with a pussy hat on surrounded by a vagina! This really upsets me in all my 83 years I've never seen anything like it. I don't know how long he can fight the press, judges, teachers union and gays. They are the ones making the loudest noise and funded by Soros!\n\nSo basically the entire world has been paid off by Soros except for the 30% that support Trump, they are the only ones that know the truth. They truly believe the entire world is against Trump, because they are either bought off or are idiots.",

So California with a population of 38,332,521 gets the same representation in the senate as Wyoming with a population of 582,658. So a person in Wyoming vote counts the same as 65.7 people that live in California.   Over the last 20 years the republicans have successfully gerrymandered many states so many congressional districts will favor a republican candidate by successfully wining state legislatures. ie. http://www.austinchronicle.com/news/2011-08-26/riding-the-pinwheel/ Austin Texas is a vary liberal city FYI. Conservatives and republicans are popular in rural America. Trump won the election by pandering to the conservative republican base. He is still vary popular with them. The republicans now are trapped by their own successful decades long rigging of the system. If they are seen by these Trump supporters as opposing Donald many republican seats will be in jeopardy.  As  Mitch McConnell  a top republican has said \" I see no benefit in us investigating one of our own\" Now if you look at the last eight presidential elections the democrats won the popular vote seven times. This would suggest to me that the majority of U.S. voters tend to lean in favor of the Democrats. BUT because of the fact that our system is rigged from the start to favor rural states the Republicans are able to hold power because of the geographic distribution of the U.S.A's population. Manly that liberal democrats are concentrated in a few vary populous states. \n\n\nEdit Thanks you berriuh for your clarifications and corrections.   ps TIL that we are more screwed up than i thought.\n\nEdit2: fixed gerrymandered",

Give me the order and it's a go.\"  And Trump, who is already on record as saying he knows more than the generals, was easily baited into approving the raid.  Because he's a puppet.",

    "body": "> When the USA was founded compromises were made to appease the the southern states. Such as every state gets 2 senators and they set up the electoral collage. \n\nOK, these are two separate compromises. And the Senate thing had little to do with the South (many Southern states were large states once you factor in the 2/3 compromise, though a few were still small) -- it was called the Connecticut Compromise by many. Small states, like Connecticut, benefited from the Senate. \n\nIn fact (from Wikipedia, about the Connecticut Compromise), the majority of the small states were Northern and the South was growing faster:\n\n>At the time of the convention, the South was growing more quickly than the North, and Southern states had the most extensive Western claims. South Carolina, North Carolina, and Georgia were small in the 1780s, but they expected growth, and thus favored proportional representation. New York was one of the largest states at the time, but two of its three representatives (Alexander Hamilton being the exception) supported an equal representation per state, as part of their desire to see maximum autonomy for the states. \n\nThe Electoral College was designed for a number of reasons, but it was not part of the Connecticut Compromise that created the Senate. A major factor in the creation/support of the Electoral College was slavery, and the Southern states factor in there (popular vote was out because even though many Southern states were large states, they heavily restricted voting to land-owning folk in most cases, whereas more voters existed in the North, plus they wanted credit for that slave population to be factored in but weren't going to let those folks vote, obviously). But there were also other factors, like the idea of another check and balance against tyrannical state legislatures and the idea that an independent body of educated men could best assess whether someone would be too dangerous to be President, etc. Obviously, all that is archaic. The authors of the Constitution were actually pretty annoyed when states started voting in blocs instead of districts for EC (this happened quickly, as states realized they could consolidate power better that way). But they were never able to successfully do anything about it. The die had been cast. \n\nThe EC is further compromised/fucked by the House caps of the 1920s that also **make it so that populous states like California don't even have truly equitable-to-population representation in the House and therefore not in the Electoral College** anymore. The EC reflects the House #s plus Senate. If the House were not capped, the proportion of CA's EC votes to WY's would be very different. The House can be capped by legislation, not a Constitutional Amendment, and was, so it inadvertently fucks over a Constitutional body like the EC (this was likely not an intention of the 1920s laws; capping the House is practical). Most people don't know that because when they learn about the EC briefly in Government class, that's not taught typically. \n\nThis also means the House is fucked not just by gerrymandering but by this factor. People are not getting truly equal-to-population representation by the body of the bicameral legislature that was designed to do so. A lot of people don't know that either. \n\nYour other points stand, but I want as much accurate information as can get out there about the EC as possible. The Senate is fine, and people tend to justify the EC by lumping it in with the Senate, but the EC actually has massive problems that the Senate does not have *and* has a much stronger connection to slavery and the Southern states than the Senate compromise (which really wasn't about that).

Moreover, I doubt any of the protectees could direct their agents to allow them to board a private aircraft without prior notice.\n\nTrump himself is boned. There's no way he gets outside the White House, much less makes it to an airport. He would literally need to be in whatever country he was planning on defecting to when he did it, and even then there's a question on whether he would be allowed to defect.\n\nBut let's say that Trump manages to dig a tunnel from underneath the Resolute desk to the outside world, make it to an airport, and board and take off on an aircraft owned by a foreign government (Russia, for example). Does the US shoot down the plane? It took 99 minutes from Kennedy's death to LBJ's swearing in. Assuming the cruising speed of a Gulfstream V, that puts Trump about 843 miles from the US coast in the Atlantic. He couldn't land anywhere in Western Europe or enter their airspace, so he'd be heading over the Arctic Circle. The range of our fully fueled Gulfstream V is about 7,000 miles, and its about 4900mi to Moscow.\n\nOn a practical level, it's certainly doable. No commercial or private airline could successfully evade a modern US Air Force fighter jet.\n\nAnd on a purely practical level, the idea of letting the guy that up until 90 minutes ago was privy to the country's most sensitive information defect to Russia would be an unconscionable breach of national security - he could not be allowed to touchdown in Moscow.\n\nSo ultimately, the first order of President Pence in this scenario would be to command the US Air Force to force Donald Trump's plane to land in the US or Canada, and failing that shoot it down.",

The implication was that donating to the charity got u an audience w the secretary of state. They continually cited the one example w the crown prince of X or some other such foreign figure that had significant status in his country. The secretary of state would meet with foreign leaders/dignitaries regardless of whether they made a small donation or not. Also there was no evidence of any quid pro quo - u donate and I'll use my office to somehow help you.  NONE. \n\nUgh I could go on and on, but clinton suffered unprecedented smearing via Bengazi hearings  (>10 of them for some reason.... oh right! to keep it in the headlines and tarnish her reputation), and even the emails were blown wildly out of proportion.  The fact is that the emails were never compromised.  And she did accidently pass on some classified information in less than 10 emails. Also in a number of those very few pertinent emails either 1. The info wasn't classified at the time or 2. Hadn't been properly denoted in the header when it was sent to her before she passed it along.\n\nShe's not corrupt.

And you can't sweep that under the rug  and pretend like everything is great and the country is united against him because there are protests- he was put in power by the people. Yes, you can discuss the electorate system's role in it, but everybody knew the rules beforehand. And he was voted in, by 63 million people who though'd he'd be an appropriate president. Who wanted him to lead. \n\nIn a way, it's lucky that he's so incompetent, because that way it might be possible to get rid of him. But next time the fascist might not be a bumbling orange idiot who'll repeatedly screw up enough to be replaced. That 63 million population that is prepared to vote for  demagogue- that's a problem that needs fixing, whether it's through education or a boost in the rural job market or whatever. Replacing Trump, if it's done, won't make them go away. \n  \nAnd I wouldn't talk about a united country rising up against him when a very large part of that same country chose him.

I've seen this type of personality in I/T management. Production issue occurs and all the key people join a call and discuss the next steps. Trump is the manager that shows up 30 minutes after the meeting already started. By the time he joins the initial group already discussed the possible solutions and are now implementing the fix. He doesn't truly understand the issue or the ramifications but the people under him do. He shows up late cause he knows he won't be able to contribute to the conversation without looking like a fool. Managers like this can slip under the radar for a while. The problem is that the people under him cant make all the judgement calls and those calls need to come from management. Ever after explaining the issue to the manager and explaining everything they still pussy foot around making a decision cause. This is where they start to fall apart. Since they never took the time to understand the issue or the ramifications to the decisions they can't give proper direction when its needed.\n\n\nThe President can't possibly know every detail. Thats why they have a staff and cabinet to help him. But even then they have to sit down and listen to the advice and spend countless nights pouring over the details.

Or lack thereof. \n\nHonestly, I don't know why people are treating them like victims. They're fucking assholes. Milo's an asshole, the BCR are assholes, the people who showed up to see Milo talk are assholes. Nobody who knows who this guy is and isn't disgusted by him is not an asshole. \n\nI don't know why all of a sudden there's this tendency in our society to mindlessly grovel to the feelings of people who are one step away from stormfront. If they haven't already taken that step. And indeed, the BCR [seem like they have](https://itsgoingdown.org/everybody-hates-berkeley-college-republicans/), based on the company they seem to like keeping. Though I would take that source with a grain of salt, that doesn't change the fact that they also invited fucking Milo, which is undeniable. \n\nI'm not going to claim that republicans are all a bunch of neo-nazis. They aren't. Like, I wouldn't call John McCain a fascist. I can hate somebody's politics without considering them pure evil. Hell, even that snake Mitch McConnel I wouldn't pin to that particular word. \n\nBut conservative discourse in this country is getting increasingly defined by an extremist, fascistic, kind of rhetoric and outlook on the world. And this should frighten more people than it does. Our friends at the Alt-Reich have managed to sneak white supremacist talking points and ideology into the republican mainstream, and it is especially apparent if you're looking at groups like the BCR or its brethren at campuses around the country. There's conservatism and then there's whatever the fuck Milo is. And they have no relation (in theory). \n\nI keep seeing the entire republican party get more and more extreme. The old guard has been trying to hold back the lunatics somewhat, but if you look at younger conservative figures and people involved in the grassroots (tea party for example) it is very, very, hard to see anything but pure and simple insanity. \n\nRepublicans need to give these people the boot if they want to save their souls and their party. So far they're trying to use them like a bunch of sycophants. And it is leading us down a path that will get darker before it ever gets brighter\n\n",
