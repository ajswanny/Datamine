    "body": "Here's some things Hunter S. Thompson had to say about Richard Nixon.\n\n> It is Nixon himself who represents that dark, venal and incurably violent side of the American character that almost every country in the world has learned to fear and despise. Our Barbie-doll president, with his Barbie-doll wife and his boxful of Barbie-doll children is also America's answer to the monstrous Mr. Hyde. He speaks for the Werewolf in us; the bully, the predatory shyster who turns into something unspeakable, full of claws and bleeding string-warts on nights when the moon comes too close\u2026\n\n-\n\n> If the current polls are reliable... Nixon will be re-elected by a huge majority of Americans who feel he is not only more honest and more trustworthy than George McGovern, but also more likely to end the war in Vietnam. The polls also indicate that Nixon will get a comfortable majority of the Youth Vote. And that he might carry all fifty states... This may be the year when we finally come face to face with ourselves; finally just lay back and say it \u2014 that we are really just a nation of 220 million used car salesmen with all the money we need to buy guns, and no qualms at all about killing anybody else in the world who tries to make us uncomfortable. The tragedy of all this is that George McGovern, for all his mistakes... understands what a fantastic monument to all the best instincts of the human race this country might have been, if we could have kept it out of the hands of greedy little hustlers like Richard Nixon. McGovern made some stupid mistakes, but in context they seem almost frivolous compared to the things Richard Nixon does every day of his life, on purpose... Jesus! Where will it end? How low do you have to stoop in this country to be President?\n\n-\n\n> We've come to a point where every four years this national fever rises up \u2014 this hunger for the Saviour, the White Knight, the Man on Horseback \u2014 and whoever wins becomes so immensely powerful, like Nixon is now, that when you vote for President today you're talking about giving a man dictatorial power for four years. I think it might be better to have the President sort of like the King of England \u2014 or the Queen \u2014 and have the real business of the presidency conducted by... a City Manager-type, a Prime Minister, somebody who's directly answerable to Congress, rather than a person who moves all his friends into the White House and does whatever he wants for four years. The whole framework of the presidency is getting out of hand. It's come to the point where you almost can't run unless you can cause people to salivate and whip each other with big sticks. You almost have to be a rock star to get the kind of fever you need to survive in American politics.\n\nImagine if he'd lived to see Trump. He saw it coming though. Maybe that's why he checked out.

After enough time, it started getting into my head. It was only after I changed jobs and stopped being bombarded by it that I moved away from it.

In this case, I think he had seen a lot of the political ads on TV where the focus was on bullying and kids.  This seemed to resonate with him, because he also saw Trump as a bully based on those ads.  This, paired with being in elementary school where the students are taught that bullying is bad caused a real emotional stir in him when Trump was elected.  Like, inconsolably crying when he found out.\n\nAs a parent, I had a lot of takeaway lessons from this, but I also had some good conversations with him about politics, respect, control, and bullying.  I don't want to completely shelter him from the world, but I also want to be sensitive to him being a victim of hyperbole & propaganda.\n\nIt's a lot to take in for a child, but it's really just another day in this world.

And will not step down. He WILL use his connections in the faux media to create and entirely seperate, and very scary reality (he already did this in one year during the election). He already wanted tanks and missiles at the innauguration. What kinda parades you think come after that? Military? No, militarized police. A lot easier to get cops scaring the populace, theyve been doing it for decades.\n\nBefore Erik Prince even comes into the picture, we have our blueprints for dystopia.\n\nAnyone out there who is waiting and seeing, get to being scared. Get to calling your representatives every fucking day. Get to telling your coworkers and family to be scared, lest they be victims.\n\nEdit: For anyone who thinks Im fear mongering or being an alarmist https://twitter.com/AlexanderEmmons/status/822473187749404672\n",

And I've worked in a lot of corporate headquarters during that time. To get just about any government job you gotta know a guy. To get a corporate job, you need to either make friends with a lot of recruiters and headhunters and hope you get lucky, or know a guy. I got into a lot of ground floor positions, where I thought there was a way forward, but there really wasn't, unless you were friends with somebody important. Otherwise you were just the help. \n\nBut the C-level executives, they have an incestuous web of alliances across boards of directors and college chums and church buddies and relatives and other C-level positions. No matter how bad you fuck up, once you're at this level you're a made man. ",
