Atleast keep an open mind about it. Shrugging this off because you lack humility is not the way to go. Save that for when you're wrong about who sings a certain song. \n\nMy theory (and it is just a theory) is that the FBI has had substantial evidence for awhile now, but have played their cards very close so they could wrap it up nice and tight without worrying about failing after making their move.\n\nOnce they fail, it could be over, and if it turns out to be true, then boy oh boy. \n\nAgain, I really can't believe a hefty amount of Republicans are so willing to shake this off. They want him left alone completley, and that is scary. It's scary to think just how easy it would be for them to get away with this if these people were everyone. \n\nI'm pretty sure the fbi saw this coming, and now that Comey has been fired, they need to act fast so they won't be further compromised.
