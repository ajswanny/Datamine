While the president can declassify any information gathered by US sources, he does not possess unilateral rights to release any classified information provided to us by another foreign state. The information he leaked was provided to us by an ally, likely Isreal. It may have put agents in that country in danger of being identified by the Russians and their own sources. \n\n**BUT WHY CAN'T RUSSIA JUST BE OUR FRIEND AND ALLY WE BOTH HATE ISIS!!!!!!**\n\nBecause Russia isn't our ally. They are a foreign state who we have exisiting and active economic sanctions against for their aggressive actions in Ukraine and Syria and who ran a propaganda war on behalf of the current president to sway the last election in his favor and which this administration is actively covering up. \n\n**THAT ISN'T PROVEN!!!**\n\nThe Russians swaying the election for Trump has been confirmed by our intelligence community, namely the FBI and the CIA. https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/clinton-blames-putins-personal-grudge-against-her-for-election-interference/2016/12/16/12f36250-c3be-11e6-8422-eac61c0ef74d_story.html The thing that that hasn't been proven is a connection between the Trump campaign and Russia in coordinating efforts together. \n\nWhich, ironically, was exactly what Comey was investigating and why Trump fired him last week. \nhttp://www.cnn.com/2017/05/12/politics/trump-comey-russia-thing/\n\n**HILLARY DID IT TOO!**\n\n(Don't fall for this trap)\n\nPresident Trump is an adult male and commander in chief of the United States military and our intelligence community. His actions in leaking classified information to US-sanctioned country that helped sway the 2016 election in his favor and firing of the single remaining independent source of investigations unto his actions are likely covering up something. We need to appoint an independent investigator into the matter, and have Trump and his team testify under oath about his exact relations with Russia. He is an adult, and the president, not Hillary Clinton. He needs to be responsible for his own actions. \n\nIf Trump and his team are actively covering up his Russian connections, then everything is on the table. Including impeachment and treason charges. If the Republican party impede this investigation, then they should similarly be held liable for their actions in covering up these actions until all parties are cleared. ",

Why does Trump seem to get special treatment? Is the GOP just so glad to be in power again that none of them are willing to go against the man that helped put them there, no matter how often or how irrevocably he harms the country they claim to love?\n\nIf this is the way it is to be, if this is the example that we intend to set for all, then our country is truly lost.

Please do read the comments and spread the karma where appropriate:\n\nThere are many differences from the Nixon situation that will affect how quickly things go from here.\n\nThe most obvious thing that might make things move slower is that Nixon had a Democratic House and Senate, while Trump has a Republican House and Senate. This also suggests that partisanship was at a much lower level - many people voted Nixon for president while voting for Democratic House and Senate candidates. Combine that with the fact that many people isolate themselves within information bubbles, and these days it can be much harder to get people to change their minds.\n\nThere are a few things that may help things move faster, including:\n\n* Trump is starting from a lower approval rating, and a close election rather than a landslide\n\n* News moves *much* faster in the age of Social Media than it did in the Nixon era\n\n* Trump's alleged crimes are *much* more serious than what Nixon did\n\n* The Trump administration is totally incompetent, whereas Nixon's was mostly competent\n\n\nTaking that all into account, it's hard to give an expected timeline for this since there's no real precedent for something like this. I wouldn't be overly shocked by any outcome between things mostly wrapping up by the end of this week or not wrapping up until Democrats regain control of a part of Congress.",

These people also make up the voters who elected every GOP congressperson and senator. As such, these lawmakers have zero motivation to impeach trump, because they can still get easily re-elected. They'll only turn on him, if he threatens their ability to get re-elected, and at the moment he's not. \n\nIt's sad. It's pathetic.

I think it would be a situation of incredible tension and uncertainty, but still physically restrained from outright violence due to the sheer physical size of the modern military infrastructure that did not exist during the last civil war.  Add to that the massive cyber and information wars, which would be the real battle fronts I think.\n\nWhat would be more interesting (and horrible) would be if different factions of the military aligned differently - ie the police, the national guard, and the actual military. I would hope that the ordinary men and woman of these outfits would stand with the people of America and not with a potentially traitorous government, but I cannot imagine that the lines will be in any way clear, especially to those right in the middle of it.",
