No. Because this is how it should have been in the first place.\n\nSomething with that much capacity to impact so many things (and so importantly) should not have been made into legislation by an easily hijacked group of people (or a single person). It's a concentration of power.\n\nSomething like this should have been made into actual law as we're seeing a possibility of here.\n\nHere's where it gets icky...\n\nEach time we see Trump et al revoke something positive for us, we see states legislate. Or Congress. Turning executive orders into law *where it should have been in the first place*. I get it when I hear everyone screaming about what Trump is doing when he does this *but it never should have been controlled by one person to begin with.* \n\nTechnically speaking, this runs in-line with most republican platforms about federal overreach or 10th amendment hard-liners. \n\nSo where's the conflict? It needs to be codified into law before it's revoked. Now, granted, this \"revoke first, legislate later\" approach we see repeated time and again now lights fires under the right asses. This shows that people aren't going to proactively do things but need to be forced to do it. And that's sad. ",

The Republican Party is not maintaining some central ground from which they can fight Democrats and continue to retain their voters. They have a trajectory that is dividing their own party and forcing them to move farther to the right, alienating more moderates and independents. A win for Roy Moore may have been just as damaging for the Republican Party as Doug Jones' win was, if not more, because it would further solidify their casual slide to the far right. If the Democrats run moderate candidates in rural conservative states compared to their progressive candidates in very blue states like CA, they have a real chance of maintaining a presence in the Midwest and even the south. There will be fewer people willing to align themselves with the alt-right wing of the GOP that is growing larger all the time, and more voters on the middle and left who will be mobilized by the increasingly vitriolic rhetoric and policy-making coming from the right.\n\n\nIt's easy to write it off as \"oh, a Democrat didn't win, a pedophile lost,\" and it may very well be true that if those allegations had never been raised then Doug Jones never would have won. But to dismiss the larger political movement and say that things will just snap back to where they were in 2016 is ignorant of important socio-political changes that may greatly benefit the left and severely hurt the right.\n\n\nHere's the best article I could find to articulate the change I'm talking about and its effects.
