    "body": "As someone from Alabama, let me say this, Roy Moore is not done. He may have been kicking and screaming since the election about \"muh voter fraud\" and \"election integrity,\" but it was all calculated nonsense. You see, contrary to what people (and myself) think, Roy Moore is *not* an idiot. He knew the election was lost. However, he was doing as he has always done in his political career: getting rich off of suckers. \n\nMoore has had this problem of getting kicked out of office and losing elections for quite some time. *The state's* problem (or not) is that he figured out a way to weaponize this and mobilize gullible people to donate to his slush funds in the name of Christianity or election integrity or some other thing. He's been top notch at turning a profit off of failed political maneuvering. \n\nAlso, last year, the state voters amended the constitution to repeal the age limit for state offices. The age limit was 70 previously. Guess how old Roy Moore turned this year, just in time for our gubernatorial elections next year? Don't expect him to go quietly into that good night. He had a fiercely loyal base. He's lined his pockets with money (last report was he was upwards of $75,000 since the *election*). He'll get back on his social media pages and state some bull shit that \"God has spoken. He did not want me to fight the swamp from the inside, but from the outside, as your governor.\"\n\nDon't think snake oil Roy is done. Alabama did their job in preventing him from having a voice in national policy, but there's still time for him to slither his way into the chief executive position for the state. \n\nEdit: my most upvoted comment ever is about Roy Moore. Thanks, reddit. \ud83d\ude11 I was kindly gilded though! Thank you!",

The elected officials are the issues. \nI work for state government, if I expensed a water cooler for the office I'd be fired. Our pay rates are so far from reality it isn't funny. Need a senior Oracle DBA? We offer about 60k. No, that's not a misprint. I have to hire \"senior\" level app devs in the 50's sometimes. We pay contract rates well over 100/hr for these types of positions though. Often it's filled by an Indian working on an H1B making just above the min required by law for the H1B, while most of the money goes to a corporate office for people that do basically nothing but headhunt and fill out some paperwork. \nMeanwhile, the legislature does not release their salaries or their staff salaries in the state when I work. All other employees do. I'm forced to meet with vendors regularly for products I don't need. I'm pressured by elected officials who serve as my boss to buy certain products or contract with certain companies. \nA large portion of industry regulation in the state comes from businesses. Most states, mine included, have dozens and dozens of professional boards run by the industries themselves, a form of quasi government that exists in state statutes, that make the rules. The regulation is primarily used to stifle the competition. Then the government is blamed for the regulation that it's mandated to enforce but didn't create. \nI could go on and on and on. Government is broke because the people we elect want it broken. They abuse it. For my office Christmas party employees pay for it ourselves. We have no other choice. Meanwhile we can pay the big name consulting firms so much money they throw free booze cruises for the managers. 100% of the money coming from taxes.\n\nModern government exists to funnel money out of government into the private companies. And it's all there out in the open, just no one does anything about it. Half our state's budget goes to contract services. Many many billions a year. Anyone can go look up the contracts and see it. They're on the web. And no one cares because \"government is evil\". It's fucking sad how bad we're being fleeced by our elected officials. ",

The actual reparations Germany was made to pay was about 2% of the national income, minuscule compared to what the Nazis would later sink into rearmament, but the rightist parties still played up the \"National Humiliation\" to sway voters and recruit muscle from the discharged veterans.\n\nIt's very hard to lose a war like World War I and not feel bitter, hell Britain and France were the 'winners' and it didn't mean much for all those homeless veterans, all those families with sons, husbands and fathers lost, but the Entente's failure was to secure *decisive* victory like the Allies would in WWII. They let the losers write the history, instead of making them see the truth: They didn't lose the war because some big nasty conspiracy was after them, they lost because they just weren't as good at fighting as the Entente was.",

If you're too old, too ill, have a handicap that hinders you from getting to the voting station or are in prison you can vote by messenger.  \nAlso, you don't need to register to vote (unless you haven't lived in Sweden for over ten years), if you're 18+, a citizen and are or have lived in Sweden at some point, you get a vote.\n\nMaking it easy to vote has lead to a voter turn out of 85,8% in the last election, which puts us at number five in the EU, and a highest ever turn out in 1976 with 91,8%. The voter turn out for the US 2016 election was 53,1% for comparison.\n\nI know it's a comparing apples and oranges, but it gives you some idea of it.",
