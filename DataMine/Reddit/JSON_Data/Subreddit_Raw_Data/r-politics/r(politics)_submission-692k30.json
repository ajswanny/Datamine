You would need recorded proof of clear selective bias against you, i.e. someone recording enough press briefings/QAs to show you're being shut out. I mean, plenty of journalists got physically shut out before the first press appearance simply because of likelihood to ask pointed, i.e. important yet damage-inducing, questions. \n\nOtherwise, there would be obvious cross-examination-like questions that they'd ask, like \"President Trump is on record for having tweeted about the election at least once per week, and you believe people who discuss the election now are a \"little sad,\" does it not follow that you think our President is a little sad then?\"\n\nA simple \"I'm not even going to dignify that by responding\" and then that reporter has lost constructive access (still able to attend, just won't be acknowledged anymore by Spicer) to the White House and gets punished by his own employer. \n\nNow that is sad.

I initially upvoted the post before reading the article/watching the video clip because I thought the same thing as you--who is Spicer/the Trump administration to condemn people for still talking about the election when Trump is almost daily bringing it up himself? But really he was saying that it's sad that Clinton is still blaming her loss on Comey rather than how she ran her campaign. Nothing he said suggests people shouldn't talk about the election, but that's what the title suggests.\n\nAnd that's why it's a misleading title.",

Im a leftist and I even I could have told you that this current brand of \"leftist\" :\"\"\"\"\") leadership is just not likeable, starting with Clinton herself. And that's just surface level, because not only are they not likeable, you can't trust them. \n\nIts not the alt rights fault that Trump won. Its not the Republicans fault or Comey's fault, or even Trump's fault that Trump won. Its Clinton's and the rest of the Democratic establishments fault. And until we democrats get our head out of our asses and start to reform the party with likeable and trustable leadership pushing fresh and truly leftist policies as the foil to the Grand Ole fascist Party, we will never take back Congress. We might win back the WH in 2020 because Trump will kill is relection all by himself, but we won't have a mandate then either. \n\n\ntl;dr\n\n\nPlease, please, please can leftists stop being insufferable and stop blaming everyone but Clinton and the rest of the leadership for the biggest political choke in my lifetime, if not ever.

There is absolutely never been a time in my life I've been more disgusted with and terrified of the state of journalism than right now. The very -first- time someone in Trump's cabinet or Trump himself said the words \"Fake news!\" we, as a society, needed a serious journalist to get a camera, find the person who said it, and have them explain why they are publicly declaring we've printed slander or knowingly misled the people. \n\nIt's terrifying to me how \"fake news\" is no longer crazy tabloids about UFO's or skeletons of human giants. Now it's a hazy degree of \"stuff I'm not sure about that's on the news.\" which is dangerous. \n\nWorst part is, the liberal MSM is just as complicit as the right-wing media in this slow degeneration of society. \nWe've celebrated idiocy, instead of just simply allowing it, to the point that if these reporters could just raise a red sign that said \"This is a lie.\" they could never prove that even with a maximum of 5 \"bullet points\" that prove the reality of it. That's how bad the propaganda and bullshit and selling out to commercialism things are. \n\nWe are not a \"functioning democracy\" right now. And anyone giving anyone shit at all about \"Boo-hoo, the news people shouldn't be going against the government.\" probably need another history lesson or two, as the USA was born out of the freedom of the press and 100% traitors to the crown of England. \n\nI get literally sick to my stomach watching Spicer get paid to feed these people this shit over and over until he can't even remember not to make slip-ups about chemical weapons and Nazis.

It's a shitty economy, most people are working and stressed about money and have too much on their mind to closely follow all of this. And even if they are, they are likely getting their news from different sources and not following the same narrative we are.\n\nEver since Trump won I've been listing to WMAL, a right-wing talk radio show (based in DC metro area, not sure how far it's broadcast, but I'm under the impression it pulls its fair share of influence among the right). They're not talking about the same things you read about here, and when they are talking about the same things, what they argue is completely different. And not in a contrarian way, they don't argue the *opposite* of what you hear from the left, just a completely unrelated angle.\n\nTheir arguments are mostly coherent and if I didn't get my information from multiple sources, I could easily see them being believable (for the record though, they're full of shit and I'm sure most of them know it).\n\nHow do you communicate with that sort of divide? It's honestly a different language, a completely different interpretation of reality. A big theme I notice with people on the right is the sense that we're all on some sort of team, that it's the USA versus the rest of the world and we need to fight to come out on top. Which isn't entirely untrue, but I don't see any of those sentiments from the left. How do you convince a large group of people that their boogeyman (globalization)isn't scary? And how do you convince an entirely different group of people that their desired utopia (globalization) isn't going to come without problems?",

Claiming that they are irredeemably ignorant is analogous to the straw-man bullshit that they perpetually pull on the left.  If we think we're better than them, then we need to prove it through outreach and organized action.  That's the Obama legacy, and we'd best damn not forget it.  Right now, the right-wing propaganda is winning the narrative, and we're acting like the whiny, dismissive douches that they constantly (mis)characterize us as.\n\nI agree that they suffer from willful ignorance.  I agree that they've lost the plot in favor of some ever-shifting moral abstraction.  I'm just saying, if we want to fix it, then at least identify the problem.
