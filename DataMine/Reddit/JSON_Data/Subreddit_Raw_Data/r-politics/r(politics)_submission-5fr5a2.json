Remember that through most of his stint as President, he has had a Republican dominated Congress who actively opposed everything he tried to push for, or anything that any Democrat pushed for.  It's one of the reasons why the ACA is such a shit-show, actually, even though it's got some good bits.  Because the GOP has the majority in both House and Senate, then, it's damn near impossible to get non-partisan policies passed.  \n\nI'm not trying to make excuses, but Obama may very well be as progressive as he says.

That said, I have no doubt that Obama's at the very least more progressive than most other Democrats.  Remember, though, that as President, you don't make laws.  You can pass laws, and you can push for or support submitted policies, or ask a member of Congress (possibly) to propose a law/policy.  But when you've got a Republican dominated Congress throughout most of your Presidential stint that /actively opposes/ literally everything that you do, then it's much harder to push for laws.  It's one of the reasons, actually, why the ACA is such a shit show.  \n\nThat said, also remember that in his first time, the GOP weren't nearly as malicious as they were during his second.  We can only guess what's actually going on in the White House, but from what I know of the federal government, it's mainly the grid-locking system that really fucks shit up for everyone involved, and the nuances of policies and execution of policies.

The people who support it are unreliable voters who just drop out and stop engaging because of 'he just did his usual dance, complete with hand waving and mirrors. Pretty much the main skill of politicians'.\n\nHe's actually taken steps to promote legalization.  No he hasn't taken unilateral action.  Imagine the first black president trying to legalize pot under extremely dubious constitutional authority.  This is the man who has been consistently painted as a secret kenyan muslim and everything he's tried to push through has become a political firestorm.\n\nLet's suppose Obama really wanted to legalize pot. Would he try and make it a major part of his legacy, which republicans would be sure to try and dismantle, or would he try and give the legalization movement legs by trying to encourage federal law enforcement not to go after states that have legalized, thereby allowing the movement to organize and gain financial backing?\n\nAh fuck it. Obama is as bad as Jeff Sessions.",

We believe that \r\nthe states should be laboratories of democracy on the issue of marijuana, and those states that \r\nwant to decriminalize it or provide access to medical marijuana should be able to do so. We \r\nsupport policies that will allow more research on marijuana, as well as reforming our laws to \r\nallow legal marijuana businesses to exist without uncertainty.
