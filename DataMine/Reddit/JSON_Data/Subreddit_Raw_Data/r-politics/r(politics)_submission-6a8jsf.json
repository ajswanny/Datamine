To them...\n\n>It's a witch hunt, a giant lie, crafted by the liberal media, to take away the thing that is theirs. They may be supremely offended.\n\n>That is when the real trouble may start.\n\nThe [Editorial Board of the New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/09/opinion/donald-trumps-firing-of-james-comey.html):\n\n>The American people \u2014 not to mention the credibility of the world\u2019s oldest democracy \u2014 require a thorough, impartial investigation into the extent of Russia\u2019s meddling with the 2016 presidential election on behalf of Donald Trump and, crucially, whether high-ranking members of Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign colluded in that effort.\n\n>By firing the F.B.I. director, James Comey, late Tuesday afternoon, President Trump has cast grave doubt on the viability of any further investigation into what could be one of the biggest political scandals in the country\u2019s history.\n\n>The explanation for this shocking move \u2014 that Mr. Comey\u2019s bungling of the investigation into Hillary Clinton\u2019s private email server violated longstanding Justice Department policy and profoundly damaged public trust in the agency \u2014 is impossible to take at face value. Certainly Mr. Comey deserves all the criticism heaped upon him for his repeated missteps in that case, but just as certainly, that\u2019s not the reason Mr. Trump fired him.\n\n>Mr. Trump had nothing but praise for Mr. Comey when, in the final days of the presidential campaign, he informed Congress that the bureau was reopening the investigation into Mrs. Clinton\u2019s emails. \u201cHe brought back his reputation,\u201d Mr. Trump said at the time. \u201cIt took a lot of guts.\u201d\n\n>Of course, if Mr. Trump truly believed, as he said in his letter of dismissal, that Mr. Comey had undermined \u201cpublic trust and confidence\u201d in the agency, he could just as well have fired him on his first day in office.\n\n>**Mr. Comey was fired because he was leading an active investigation that could bring down a president.** Though compromised by his own poor judgment, Mr. Comey\u2019s agency has been pursuing ties between the Russian government and Mr. Trump and his associates, with potentially ruinous consequences for the administration.\n\n>With congressional Republicans continuing to resist any serious investigation, Mr. Comey\u2019s inquiry was the only aggressive effort to get to the bottom of Russia\u2019s ties to the Trump campaign. So far, the scandal has engulfed Paul Manafort, one of Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign managers; Roger Stone, a longtime confidant; Carter Page, one of the campaign\u2019s early foreign-policy advisers; Michael Flynn, who was forced out as national security adviser; and Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who recused himself in March from the Russia inquiry after failing to disclose during his confirmation hearings that he had met twice during the campaign with the Russian ambassador to the United States.\n\n>We have said that Mr. Comey\u2019s atrocious handling of the Clinton email investigation, which arguably tipped the election to Mr. Trump, proved that he could not be trusted to be neutral, and that the only credible course of action would be the appointment of a special prosecutor. Given all that has happened \u2014 the firing of the F.B.I. director, on top of Mr. Trump\u2019s firing of the acting attorney general, Sally Yates, and his dismissal of nearly all United States attorneys \u2014 the need for such a prosecutor is plainer than ever. Because Mr. Sessions is recused, the decision to name a special prosecutor falls to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, whose memo, along with a separate one by Mr. Sessions, provided Mr. Trump with the pretense to fire Mr. Comey.\n\n>This is a tense and uncertain time in the nation\u2019s history. The president of the United States, who is no more above the law than any other citizen, has now decisively crippled the F.B.I.\u2019s ability to carry out an investigation of him and his associates. There is no guarantee that Mr. Comey\u2019s replacement, who will be chosen by Mr. Trump, will continue that investigation; in fact, there are already hints to the contrary.\n\n>The obvious historical parallel to Mr. Trump\u2019s action was the so-called Saturday Night Massacre in October 1973, when President Richard Nixon ordered the firing of the special prosecutor investigating Watergate, prompting the principled resignations of the attorney general and his deputy. But now, there is no special prosecutor in place to determine whether the public trust has been violated, and whether the presidency was effectively stolen by a hostile foreign power. For that reason, the country has reached an even more perilous moment.\n",

The issue is with Donald firing the man who is investigating him.

    "body": "Let me explain for people actually curious and not shitposting why this is makes *no sense* unless Trump feels like the blowback from firing Comey is less than doing nothing.\n\nFirst off the rational is clearly bunk. Jeff Sessions recommended firing Comey, a Republican, for how he handled Hillary's email, which handed Trump the White House? Five months after taking office.\n\nFIVE MONTHS. \n\nPlease. Not even going to entertain that one. \n\nThings we know: Sally Yates and Clapped testified yesterday, reasserting that the administration had direct knowledge of Flynn's contacts to Russia. Comey was due to speak to the Senate both privately and testify to the IC again next week. He has stated already he has pending investigations brewing in two different District Courts, both near DC. \n\nHere's why this makes no sense:\n\nOption #1: Trump does nothing. This makes the most sense if you don't feel like Comey has you nailed. He may have Flynn, but can't tie it to the administration. Let the Dems call up hearing and whine, then let the public get bored and let the issue die. The advantage to this option is it makes you look less guilty. They investigated, never had enough to file anything with district court, and it looks like common political bickering rather than treason.  \n\nOption #2: Fire Comey. You risk massive blow back because, let's face it, firing the person investigating you makes you look guilty as hell. The only way you do this is if you felt like something was coming down the pipeline and it had to be stopped now, then drown it out with your own FBI appointment. It looks like a coverup, because it probably is. It's a bold, reckless move, and very Trump-esque. \n\nWhat happens next? We see how prepared Comey was for a very predicable action. I can't imagine he, or anyone else, really thought Trump would let him investigate his administration unimpeded. We're about to see what our IC community, media, and Democrats are really made of because they need to pounce on this hard, harder than they've ever hit anything in their life.\n\nJust imagine if this was Hillary Clinton, and she fired Comey in the middle of his investigation into her emails.\n\nImage how hard the GOP would hit her and the issue.\n\nDemocrats need to hit twice that. They need to demand a special prosecutor and light the outrage meter to 100. Otherwise Trump's gambit just might work.  ",

I concur with the judgment of the Department of Justice that you are not able to effectively lead the Bureau.\n\n**TL;DR -** Donald Trump will justify Comey's termination on the grounds that he mishandled Clinton's emails. But the fact remains that Jeff Session and the Justice Department should **never have been fucking making recommendations to terminate the people investigating the Trump campaign in the first place.**",

William Sessions (no relation to our friend Jeff) was appointed by Ronald Reagan, served through HW Bush's presidency, then just before Clinton was inaugurated, he was accused of ethics violations. Most of it had to do with doing personal stuff on the bureau's dime: using an FBI plane and limo to make personal trips, having a home security system installed using federal funds, etc. After a while, the Attorney General recommended that Sessions be terminated. But before doing that, Clinton gave Sessions a chance to resign, to go down gracefully. He refused, saying he didn't believe he'd done anything wrong, so Clinton fired him.\n\nThis situation is *so* much different. Even if the person doing the firing wasn't currently under investigation by Comey, it *still* isn't normal to fire an FBI director without notice. In fact, it's *never* happened to an appointed FBI director. The director before Comey, Robert Mueller, was actually asked by Obama to stay an extra two years past the end of his ten year term because he believed the bureau could still benefit from Mueller's strong, continued leadership. And Mueller was appointed under the W Bush administration!\n\nThis shit ain't normal.\n\n**Edit:** Clarified wording",
