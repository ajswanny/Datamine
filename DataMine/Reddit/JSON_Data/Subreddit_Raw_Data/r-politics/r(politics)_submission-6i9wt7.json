They'll pick and choose who gets information from the Whitehouse, and act like it's a huge win for them.\n\nThe more I watch what's going on in Trumplandia, the more I'm coming to believe that Trump seriously misjudges the position that he's in.  He's convinced that he has a *huge* support base - much larger than what the polls indicate - and just takes his electoral win as unimpeachable evidence that *real* America is on his side, no matter what the fake media says.  I honestly think he's drinking his own Kool-Aid on the \"fake media\" angle.  I don't know how else to explain the fact that, with every challenge to his administration he *only* doubles-down on his base.  He has never made an effort to reach out to independents or come off as anything other than the ultra-aggressive Alpha-CEO that he knows his base wants to see.  The long and the short of it is that he thinks he can keep winning on the backs of people that are still wearing their red MAGA caps, and the rest of America can go to hell.  ",
