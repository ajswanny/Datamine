    "body": "People need to start thinking why Donald Trump thinks this way.  It's not based on science or reasoning.  It's based on self interest.\n\nLet's ignore the donor angle and just talk about Trump himself.  He's a land developer.  You know who he fights with on every project?  Departments like the EPA.  They wouldn't let him do whatever he wants when building a development, building, or golf course.  Departments like the EPA have cost him millions of dollars if not more.  He probably has abandoned projects because of the restrictions imposed by these types of departments.  So he sees them as being in his way.  He can't make as much money and do what he wants, so he kills these departments so he can.\n\nThis is all so transparent, yet people continue to go back to the \"Donald Trump is stupid\" narrative.  I'm not sure how smart or stupid Trump is, but we know he's all about himself.  This is proven.  So stop trying to just brush everything off as \"Donald Trump is a moron\" and start thinking \"Why would Trump do this?  How does it benefit him?\"  More often than not, it either benefits him directly or he just doesn't give a shit about it and uses it to gain favor with donors or other senators (and their donors).",

The goddamn [Department of Defense has been saying that climate change is a security risk to the United States and its Armed Forces for years now,](https://www.defense.gov/News/Article/Article/612710/) but the president chooses to ignore them.\n\n[Here's another article about how the Pentagon has continued to prepare for the threat of climate change despite our dumbass president's decision to dismiss the issue.](https://www.militarytimes.com/news/your-military/2017/09/12/pentagon-is-still-preparing-for-global-warming-even-though-trump-said-to-stop/)\n\nWhat's the point of spending billions upon billions of dollars to bolster our military if we're just going to ignore their warnings?\n\nThe White House says that climate change should be ignored, and the country's focus should instead be on the economy and on border security.  Guess what, jackasses?  When our coastal cities get hit by more and more hurricanes, that will have an adverse effect on the economy.  And it wasn't just Puerto Rico that got devastated by hurricanes this year. States whose electoral votes went to Donald - Texas and Florida - got hit, too.  \n\nClimate change doesn't only target blue states.  Voters who are being hurt by the effects of climate change are going to remember how this administration ignored the issue.\n\nAlso, when other nations around the world are severely harmed by extreme weather, drought, famine, and other things caused by climate change, does the White House think their problems will not affect us? There won't be more refugees trying to enter the US, legally or illegally?  \n\nShit that's this obvious to a schlub like me should be obvious to our country's top officials.  But they won't do anything about it because they're either too ignorant to realize how bad the situation is, or they're too beholden to the fossil fuel industry, God-crazy evangelicals, or other special interest groups that don't like climate change discussion.  Too bad there isn't a super-wealthy lobby called \"Save the Fucking Planet\" that can outspend all the others and finally get both parties to work together on climate change.\n\nThis should not be a partisan issue.\n\n**Edit:**  [Here's the Department of Defense's 2014 Climate Change Adaptation Roadmap.](https://www.acq.osd.mil/eie/Downloads/CCARprint_wForward_e.pdf)\n\n",

As sea levels rise, the monument will begin to be submerged, at increasingly greater depths. It will become a symbol of the cynicism, stupidity, and folly of our age.

Who stands to gain from the instability and security threats that the US Govt already recognized will result from global warming? One hand of the US Govt is making arguments for more military spending to fight the results of climate change while the other hand simultaneously agrees to the extra funding and disagrees with the reasoning. \n\nNow Republicans are happy because: \n\n1) many dont believe in climate change, this reinforces their beliefs \n\n2) goes against liberals, makes Rs feel like \"their team wins\" \n\n3) some are happy to see anything related to Obama be removed. \n\n\nThis effect is pretty obvious but **the more insidious effect it's having is that it's making Liberals softer when it comes to military spending, which is huge**. The military is now the only \"voice of reason\" many Liberals are seeing in this current administration and the argument of increased spending *due to climate change* is something that many Liberals have no problem with and are actually convincing themselves is true in order to use as proof against Republicans and Trump. The US population is too busy being caught up in fighting with each other to see all of the people at the top who are profiting off of this and who couldn't care less about Rs and Ls because it all means the same to them.\n\nPeople in Puerto Rico are going through the worst blackout in American history and Alabama gets visited by UN investigators who compare it to a third world country with some of the worst poverty and sewage problems they've seen in the developed world. Flint can't even use their tap water because it's literally poisonous.\n\nHow can this happen in a country whose Govt spends billions of dollars on military projects that never see the light of day let alone the scrutiny of a newspaper or journalist. Or billions of dollars on some nebulous \"foreign aid\" that is fraught with stories of money mismanagement and no accountability. US Military funding is full of stories of billions going missing, projects going way overbudget, projects being given to specific contractors with no bidding process, projects having billions of dollars dumped into them and then cancelled. And no one bats an eye.\n\nPeople get outraged at the thought of Netflix raising their monthly price by a few dollars or make fun of people for buying $4 coffees at Starbucks but don't give two shits about being fleeced for tax dollars that have ended up making the US Military Industrial Congressional complex the most powerful entity in the world that everyone knows exists but also is strangely okay with not knowing anything about it.\n",

Winning the Senate would allow them the same power, but would be even sweeter because then they could block all Trump appointments of people viewed as extreme - either members of his cabinet or federal judges (and Supreme Court seats if anyone dies/retires). Unfortunately, Democrats are not favored to win the Senate (though they are within striking distance), because something like 2/3 of the seats up for reelection are Democratic already, and a number of them are in states that Trump won in 2016 - so Democrats would have to hold all their current seats and win 2 more in strong Republican or Republican-leaning states (e.g. Arizona or Nevada).\n\nUnfortunately, 2016 would have been the best year for Democrats to retake the Senate, but liberals fucked it up by staying home because they didn't like Hillary.",

Funny how tables turn. \n\nAlso, the EU is great at pointing fingers but if we are so stupid, why don\u2019t you sanction us? Most Americans don\u2019t want to see their country crash and burn, Republican or Democrat. Only the truly brainwashed and stupid would stick with Trump if the world were to reject him and things here were made to take a serious nose dive (worse than it has been, which is hard to imagine but chillingly possible). \n\nIf he went full on dictator mode and tried to declare martial law, I think a number Americans would almost certainly revolt and there would be a civil war of some kind. His support is still too shaky even in his own military for him to make a jab at seizing dictatorship of the US. He has more or less already flouted every law he has come into conflict with, but I don\u2019t think the American public has been made gullible enough to go along with a Soviet style totalitarian state yet. I have lived here my whole life and there are still a lot of people here that have a pretty deeply ingrained inability to tolerate genuine bullshit. I think the majority of people here are still fully aware of the fact that they are constantly being lied to by politicians, they have just been robbed of the power, or the desire, to act. \n\nTo Europeans I say this\u2014do not underestimate how oppressive and crafty the US government has become. The image they attempt to put out is absolutely nothing like the reality of the situation. Even though the dysfunction is getting hard to mask with smiles and lies at this point, it is still worse than you think. They find ways to suppress voter voices and cheat in every election and NOBODY EVER SEES THE INSIDE OF A JAIL CELL. \n\nEvery single social welfare system in this country is in horrible disrepair. It is honestly more annoying and more disheartening to see this than it is to see the leaders of other \u201cthird world\u201d regimes being imprisoned for the crimes against humanity that they commit. The third world literally does a better job at enforcing political law than the first world does in 2017. Shameful. \n\nI think at this point a lot of the reason many Republicans are standing by Trump is that they will still be allowed to behave any way they want no matter what he does or how much of an ass he makes of the himself and the already dismal reputation of the USA as a leader in world government. If people started boycotting our more evil companies worldwide and stopped importing things that mainly 1%s consume anyway, it would go a long way to making a meaningful change in the way our ball seems to be rolling. Money isn\u2019t just circulating around the domestic economy. Our kleptocracy is being funded by the entire world. \n\nWe all need to work together and love each other, not tear ourselves to shreds with pettiness and stupidity like the internet has taught us to do so well. A heavy dose of effective, sane political policy that took effect quickly would be like a long drink of water after a walk in the desert at this point.",

They think they're patriots, because the meaning of the word patriot and its associated words (patriotic, patriotism) have been slowly and carefully usurped by the political right.\n\nBeing proud of and supportive of your nation is one thing.  Believing that your nation is the best, always right, can do no wrong, and can do whatever it wants is something else entirely.\n\nThere are a lot of ordinary, decent folks left, but critical thinking has been systematically destroyed and conservatives have been radicalized and weaponized.  It's a scary fucking time.  Lots of loud, ignorant idiots who are proud of their volume and their ignorance, and who are just doing what they're told by their tribe.",
