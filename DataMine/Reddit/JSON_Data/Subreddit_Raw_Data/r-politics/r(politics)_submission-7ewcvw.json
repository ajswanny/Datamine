Consumers complained, and the Federal Communications Commission, under Michael Powell, its Republican-appointed chairman, promptly fined the company and forced it to stop blocking Vonage.\n\n-\n\n> [Really into](http://www.businessinsider.com/net-neutrality-portugal-how-american-internet-could-look-fcc-2017-11) messaging?

That'll be another \u20ac4.99 a month.\n\n>Video apps like Netflix and YouTube are available as another add-on, while music (Spotify, SoundCloud, Google Play Music, etc.) is another, as is email and cloud (Gmail, Yahoo Mail, iCloud, etc.). \n\n-\n\n>Ajit Pai and the FCC want it to be [legal for Comcast to block BitTorrent](https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/22/16691794/net-neutrality-fcc-ajit-pai-comcast-block-bittorrent)\n\n>Pai thinks it was a mistake for the FCC to try and stop Comcast from blocking BitTorrent in 2008, thinks all of the regulatory actions the FCC took after that to give itself the authority to prevent blocking were wrong, and wants to go back to the legal framework that allowed Comcast to block BitTorrent.\n\n-\n\n>FCC will also [order states to scrap plans for their own net neutrality laws](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/11/fcc-will-also-order-states-to-scrap-plans-for-their-own-net-neutrality-laws/)\n\nThis isn't a hypothetical.

Examples include AT&T\u2019s efforts to keep Skype off iPhones and the blocking of Google Wallet by Verizon. Services like Skype and Netflix would have met an early death without basic net neutrality protections. Mr. Pai needs to explain why we no longer have to worry about this sort of threat \u2014 and \u201cYou can trust your cable company\u201d will not suffice.",

Before they overplayed their hand and started acting banning small business owners for excessive usage while denying their was a business cap, the main issue that led to the current FCC stance on it was the fact that Comcast in particular was colluding with the RIAA and MPAA by straight up sabotaging BitTorrent traffic. The studios had essentially already given up the direct suits for the copyright strikes method, and this was the last ditch attempt to stop BT distribution. It meant that regardless of what you were downloading, legal or not, Comcast just nuked the connection and made it almost unusable even on high tier plans. It wasn't until the FCC stepped in that they finally backed off. That also led to them having to be honest about their plans, which is the only reason we have bandwidth amounts today. Otherwise they would have just kept pretending it was unlimited, but even in that they found a way to turn the internet into tiers with the different bandwidth plans.",

But nonetheless, regardless of their hypocrisy, the idea that the executive branch possesses too much power certainly has some merit. We blinded ourselves to this reality with partisanship.  \n\nNo more. The Trump years need to be a lesson to us in this.

It cannot not be big for a country the size of the United States, with the vast interests, infrastructure, citizenry, and military this country has.\n\nThe issue is when shit is working, people get complacent and lazy. They stop paying attention. When people stop paying attention, the eternal vigilance required to protect democracy begins to be eroded away by those who yearn for more power and wealth even at the expense of others. People aren't watching, those people get themselves into positions of power where they can affect laws, and we end up with the legalized bribery that we currently have now in the US.\n\nIf politicians were not able to be bribed by corporations and were not reliant on donor money to run in and win elections, then they would represent the people who elect them again, rather than the people currently buying them the election with advertising.\n\nAnd when those politicians work for the people they are supposed to represent... then the big Government we have to have to run our big country actually works in our interests and utilizes its size as it is supposed to: to run programs that are too large in scale for more localized governments or communities to handle themselves.\n\nNow does the NSA need to be spying on every American? Fuck no. But should the FCC be regulating the industries it exists to regulate? Fuck yes. The problem is due to legalized bribery and the revolving door from private corporations to public office and back, we're drowning in regulatory captured and these institutions which are supposed to regulate industries to protect citizens are instead being run by those industries in their interests, not ours.\n\nEdit: Also of note is that the President isn't all that powerful, it's the fact that the GOP controls all three executive branches that is the problem here. They didn't gain control of one almighty seat of power; they took over the Presidency *and* Congress, different seats of power which are supposed to keep each other in check. But when you elect an extremist right-wing party to all the executive branches of power in your Government, then yes, they get to do pretty much whatever the fuck they want.",

You've seen the scandal over fake comments and dead people writing in in favor of it, but honestly that doesn't even matter. All that is required is the opportunity to comment. They can completely ignore all of them. It doesn't matter. Were it not for the occasional rational and responsible agency head the whole thing would be fucking useless.

They can just as easily make a law saying this is Congressional matter (Well rather it is directly written in the law and not a regulatory ruling, thus demanding new law to change the classification)\n\nOr even better they should make a separate ISP class of communication operators and then say utility and common carrier rules of type XYZ apply to ISPs. \n\nOne of the biggest problems is trying to regulate ISP as telephone company or information/entertainment service provider. \n\nIt is its own new thing, which needs it's  own laws. Though I think it should be recognized that ISP is utility common carrier type service. Which makes it in some ways similar as phone company. However the is significant differences also why it should have its own classification.\n\n Essentially make classification telecommunications utility, specific type internet service provider. Then there would be telecommunications utility, telephony service provider. Which would share some basic concepts like common carrier etc. But would have differences in technical and other aspects where pots and internet are different.\n\nThen there would be information services which are not of utility type, since those are optional addons and not necessary for daily conduct. Unlike say phone or internet service.\n\nWhich means making new telecommunications act.",

    "body": "Okay, I'm gonna lay this out from the libertarian perspective.\n\nThe free market requires competition. The harder it is to compete in a market, the less free the market is. This is really obvious when you think about it - imagine we all build roads for a town.\n\nIf I am one of 30 road builders, obviously, if my roads are shitty, you'll drive on a different road. Suppose it costs me $10 a mile to build my shitty road, and it costs my competitor $50 a mile to build their good road.\n\nSo the gap in value between our services is $40. But roads are important - you're probably willing to pay for the better roads, especially since like any product, the cost will get spread out over everyone who uses it.\n\nThe catch is when I, in my wisdom, decide to build my shitty road for $10 and then pay some other guy $20 to shoot you in the face so your road never gets built. Total cost to me is $10 per mile + $20 one time, the town has nothing but shitty roads, and I make a fucking killing.\n\nThe guy who just shot you in the face is an artificial barrier to entry. Because I got here first, I can make it harder and more expensive for you to get into my territory at all to compete with me. I can essentially build a little fence and say \"inside this fence there's no free market, there's just me. I win.\"\n\nInternet companies do this with exclusivity agreements. In rural areas there is often only one ISP for an area if there's any ISP at all. In towns and cities, apartment complexes often have exclusivity agreements in return for kickbacks. For example, I have to have AT&T. I have no alternative in this complex. I'd have to move. And the 5 other complexes I looked at also have the same thing just w/ a different fixed provider.\n\nSo there's no actual free market here, where I pick the ISP that's the \"good guy\". That \"good guy\" ISP can't sell me his product. The artificial barriers to entry have destroyed the free market for internet services.\n\nThis is why Net Neutrality is so important - if ISPs have created a system where nobody is allowed to compete with them and destroyed the free market, the best thing to do is make sure they at least all have to offer the same core product. At least this way all Americans will get internet even though they don't have access to a free market.",
