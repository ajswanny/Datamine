Among the memos, it's revealed that Trump asked Comey to stop the Flynn probe (which Trump then denied in a news conference on Thursday), and to jail journalists.\n\n**Wednesday** - Rod Rosenstein formally announces the creation of a Special Counsel to take over the DOJ's Russia investigation.  Robert Mueller is selected by Rosenstein to lead this counsel, with widespread support across all parties in Washington.  Trump releases statement that he looks forward to the counsel finding no collusion.  Additionally, a leaked McCarthy tape featuring Paul Ryan reveals that McCarthy believed that Trump is paid by Putin. Paul Ryan says to not leak whatever was said. \n\n**Thursday** - A report comes out that states the trump campaign was trying to set up a backchannel for Trump and Putin.  Trump seemingly reverses his opinion of the Special Counsel, calling it a \"witch-hunt\".  \n\n**Friday** - Another source reveals that Trump spoke to the Russians that he was glad that he fired Comey.  His reasoning was that it took off the pressure of the Russian Investigation.  Washington Post article releases that details how a significant person in the Trump administration is a key figure of interest in the FBI investigation.  Additionally,  Jim Comey announces he has agreed to testify before the Senate Intelligence Committee. \n\nChrist.  This entire week is one for the history books. ",

Ryan and the GOP leadership wasn't on anybody's radar until this week.  If more tapes surface I can only imagine they would validate her reporting further.

Trump is notoriously incapable of handling sustained questioning (or even being *around* people he doesn't want to be near), and they just dropped two bombshells in quick succession and trapped him on a plane full of journalists for an hours-long flight with nowhere really to hide.\n4. Now the next news cycle isn't going to be dominated by Trump's self-aggrandising state visit to Saudi Arabia - it's going to be Trump on the back foot as he desperately tries to react to these two(!) different stories while out of the country and out of the loop.  They basically pissed all over his \"look at me, I'm great, I'm the president, I'm so presidential, it's all about me\" tour to Saudi Arabia and made it background noise to the latest scandals consuming his presidency.\n5. All of those things ratchet up the pressure on Trump, increasing the likelihood that he'll fuck up and say or do something stupid in response and implicate himself further.\n6.
