    "body": "I'm sorry, I know this will probably get me downvoted to hell, but I'm almost to the point where I can't take Sanders seriously anymore.  \n\nWhy?  Because he quite correctly points to all the bullshit Hillary and the DNC have said and done and then, in the next sentence, says \"We've got to elect Hillary Clinton\".\n\nI mean, look, I get it: Trump bad.  I'm not exactly arguing that point.  But doesn't there come a time when you've got to stand up and say \"You know what? This party and this candidate are SO corrupt that even keeping Trump out of the White House isn't good enough reason\"?  Isn't there a point at which playing as unfairly as they are has GOT to be punished by not letting them get their way?\n\nTo me there is, and we're long past it, but Sanders seems to be just playing the good party lapdog now.  You can't say X, Y and Z are bad, but vote for the candidate of X, Y and Z anyway (even with the unspoken \"because W is worse\"), not beyond that line at least.\n\nI mean, what WOULD it take, I have to wonder?  If we found out that someone murdered someone... straight-up killed someone in service of getting Hillary elected (and I AM NOT claiming anyone did, just a hypothetical) would Bernie still say \"Well, gotta keep Trump out, so I'll ignore it\"?\n\nBecause honestly, at this point, I think that's EXACTLY what he'd say, and sadly, along with A LOT of other people in this country.\n\nIt's like he's throwing his values and principles away now but still trying to make it SEEM like he's not.  To my eyes, it isn't working.  If you KNOW your party stole the nomination from you, and if you KNOW your party will do ANYTHING it has to in order to get its Chosen One elected (and I mean \"anything\" to mean LITERALLY anything, no matter how unscrupulous or, I believe, downright illegal) and you STILL are okay with them getting away with it - indeed, implicitly HELP THEM to do so - then I'm sorry but the respect I very much had for Bernie is very quickly fading away.  \n\nTo my mind, you simply CANNOT reward this kind of behavior even if it means a Trump presidency.  If you can't win fair you don't get to win and you sure as hell don't reward the behavior!",

However, with debt at post-war record high levels and projected to grow unsustainably, simply remaining on our current course is not enough. Secretary Clinton would need over $4 trillion of deficit reduction to simply replace the sequester and stabilize the debt at its current high levels. So far she has proposed over $1.5 trillion of savings, and yet does not dedicate even a fraction of it to putting the debt on a more sustainable path. Ultimately, a mixture of spending cuts, tax increases, and entitlement reform is likely to be necessary in order to grow the economy and fix the debt for future generations. We hope Secretary Clinton will pursue these policies going forward, putting new ideas on the table rather than simply taking ideas off. Paying for new initiatives is a good start, but much more must be done.\n\n\n",

Donald Trump doesn't win the Republican primary in any rigged system, and Barack Obama doesn't win in '08 in any rigged system either.\n\nHe had to fight uphill against Wasserman-Schultz and the DNC, which was supposed to be fair. He wasn't able to do it to secure the nomination, so now the options are as follows:\n\n* Blow up Clinton so that Trump can be President\n* Blow up the DNC so that it's no longer run by the people who wronged him\n\nGiven that he almost certainly gets more of his platform enacted in a Clinton presidency, it seems like the latter is a much better option than the former.

However, they may be assigned some degree of responsibility for evaluating or even creating the organization's policy and direction.\n\nPAs in the Executive Office of the President (EOP) often directly support the president by providing advisory and administrative assistance. They might be expected to advise the president on a wide range of areas, including foreign relations, US and international economic policy, and homeland security. In addition PAs in the EOP assist in maintaining relationships between the White House and Congress, the executive branch agencies, and state and local governments.\n\nResponsibilities of PAs serving directly in federal agencies and departments are the most diverse. They may be assigned to assist presidential appointees in positions that require Senate approval. Others may serve as US representatives to United Nations organizations. Others may be assigned leadership roles at highly visible non-agency organizations, such as the National Cancer Institute or the National Institutes of Health.\n\nhttp://www.gao.gov/assets/660/652573.pdf\n\nhttps://www.congress.gov/bill/112th-congress/senate-bill/679/text\n",

I heard a lot of \"I told you so\", in so many words.\n\nIf the DNC is fractured, if there are riots at the convention, if Trump wins - we need to remember to blame DWS, not Sanders. We need to remember to blame DWS, and Barbara Boxer, and every Hillary supporter who ever told a Bernie supporter \"your voice doesn't matter\"\n\nA *LOT* or people are *VERY* angry about this. We need a serious, open, lengthy discussion from party leadership on this subject or the DNC convention will be just a pointless and poor as the GOP one was.\n\nWe can't simply blame Russia for exposing Debbie's shitty actions that sabatoged multiple primaries and caucuses, we must address the ramifications of her exposed actions, and we must do so very publicly",

But instead, by leveraging his delegates in the DNC to positively change the Democratic Party platform on key issues, he has already begun to succeed despite losing the nomination. All those donations just go to getting more progressives into the house which further cement his dream of a more progressive America.\n\nThis is a pragmatic approach, this is a realistic approach, a Trump presidency who has veto would shit all over his policies with that veto button, especially if it seems that Trump is willing to be a face, a mere puppet and give Pence the power as he had offered to Kasich. He knows it. He knows that Trumps current Supreme court picks would fuck up gay marriage, set back womens rights 30 years and push back the hopes and dreams he carries on his shoulders, there could be 2? conservative supreme court picks directing the flow of the US landscape for decades to come away from his policies and positive change. He knows it. He might not believe that Hillary is better suited for presidency than he is, but he knows for certain that Trump is basically diametrically opposed to him on every level and that a win against Trump is more important in the grand scheme.\n\nIts a smart play.

Johnson and other libertarians only want this to happen after the drug war is ended, decriminalizing drugs and hopefully freeing up the prison system a little bit. Let's not forget that federal and state run prisons have corruption problems of their own, with unions lobbying for increased drug regulation so that the guards and prison staff could keep their jobs. To me, private prisons that are not actively pushing for more intense drug laws or other nonsensical laws and regulations are in theory a very good thing, as they could probably be run more efficiently and at a lesser cost with little government involvement. It would just have to be done correctly.\n\nIt shouldn't be a disqualifying issue if the drug war is ended first, which is what he has said he would do.",

Politics, along with religion, wall st., and corporate boardrooms, are natural fits.  I do think that many go into politics with the best of intentions and ideals but when they reach the thin air of high level politics the games change.  You're surrounded by pressures on all sides but one is offering you money and power.  You're also surrounded by \"yes men\" who build your ego.  You live a life removed from the people who trusted you with the position.  Life then exists in a bubble where you have security and limousines and are welcome and celebrated everywhere.  \n\nThis all becomes worse for the citizen because we only see and hear about the worst actors.  Politicians who attempt to approach their jobs honestly and work diligently aren't interesting enough for constant news coverage.  There's alot of Bernie supporters this primary but outside of true political junkies very few could've told you much about him a couple of years back.  ",
