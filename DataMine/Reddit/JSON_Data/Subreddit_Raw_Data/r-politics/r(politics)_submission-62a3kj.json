    "body": "Hey guys, Max here from Cards Against Humanity! We are incredibly excited to see Reddit rally behind a fair and open internet. We couldn't have started our company without it.\n\n**Tonight we are matching up to $10,000 of your donations to the Electronic Frontier Foundation: https://supporters.eff.org/donate/**\n\nNOW - here's the situation on buying the internet history of Congressmen as I understand it.\n\n1. First off - this bill hasn't been signed, the data doesn't exist, and nobody knows what they're talking about. We don't know if there will be any data to buy, how it will work, or what will be available. This means you should be very skeptical of any GoFundMe projects to buy this data. They are making promises they can't possibly keep.\n\n2. If and when any data becomes available, myself and Cards Against Humanity will do whatever we can do acquire it and publish it. We have a long track record of activism and spending around government transparency issues. We've donated [over a million dollars to the Sunlight Foundation](https://www.cardsagainsthumanity.com/sunlight/) and [the EFF](https://store.cardsagainsthumanity.com/#WWW).\n3. This may take a long time. We may have to file FOIA requests. We may have to buy browsing data for Congressional office building ZIP codes and then p-hack our way to statistical significance in an attempt to fish spurious correlations out of unreliable datasets, but [we've done it before](https://www.cardsagainsthumanity.com/survey/).\n4. The amount of attention this is getting is honestly starting to scare me. I know that voting this up is funny, and easy, and feels good. But even if we get this data, it's a symbolic victory at best. Our basic human rights, like the right to privacy, are being sold to the highest bidder while the best minds of our generation are here on Reddit asking pro gamers if they want to fight a horse-sized duck or whatever. Real, material change requires sacrifice. You probably can't do it on a computer. **If you're frustrated with the way things are going, the incompetence and corruption of government, and the money in politics, we need to [support institutions like the EFF](https://supporters.eff.org/donate/) and we need to be heard by elected officials.** I really like the tool [5Calls.org](https://5calls.org/). If 100 Redditors called a congressman, it would freak them out and their staff would have to do something about it. It really doesn't take much.\n\nAs you talk about these issues with your friends and family, some people might ask you why this all matters. [Here's a great answer from Bruce Schneier](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2006/05/the_value_of_pr.html), a reminder of what's at stake:\n\n\n> *Those in favor of these programs have trotted out the same rhetorical question we hear every time privacy advocates oppose ID checks, video cameras, massive databases, data mining, and other wholesale surveillance measures: \"If you aren't doing anything wrong, what do you have to hide?\"*\n>     \n> *Some clever answers: \"If I'm not doing anything wrong, then you have no cause to watch me.\" \"Because the government gets to define what's wrong, and they keep changing the definition.\" \"Because you might do something wrong with my information.\" My problem with quips like these -- as right as they are -- is that they accept the premise that privacy is about hiding a wrong. It's not. Privacy is an inherent human right, and a requirement for maintaining the human condition with dignity and respect.*\n>     \n> *Two proverbs say it best: Quis custodiet custodes ipsos? (\"Who watches the watchers?\") and \"Absolute power corrupts absolutely.\"*\n>     \n> *Cardinal Richelieu understood the value of surveillance when he famously said, \"If one would give me six lines written by the hand of the most honest man, I would find something in them to have him hanged.\" Watch someone long enough, and you'll find something to arrest -- or just blackmail -- with. Privacy is important because without it, surveillance information will be abused: to peep, to sell to marketers and to spy on political enemies -- whoever they happen to be at the time.*\n>     \n> *Privacy protects us from abuses by those in power, even if we're doing nothing wrong at the time of surveillance.*\n>     \n> *We do nothing wrong when we make love or go to the bathroom. We are not deliberately hiding anything when we seek out private places for reflection or conversation. We keep private journals, sing in the privacy of the shower, and write letters to secret lovers and then burn them. Privacy is a basic human need.*",

Your data is put into a bucket that advertisers use to blanket target - you aren't Steve that enjoys DnD and hiking on the weekends, you're one of thousands of young adult men who enjoy fantasy board games and is an outdoors enthusiast.\n\nAdvertisers don't care about Steve, even though he's probably a pretty cool guy, because online advertising is about putting their ad in front of as many Steve's as possible since each individual ad, aside from search advertising, has a relatively low conversion rate (people that see ad and directly go to buy item or service).  For reference, a good click-through rate (percent of people that see an ad and click on it) is only 2%.\n\nIt's a game of numbers which is why you've seen the rise of influencer marketing - millennials are spending less of their internet time on desktops and more time living their world through social media.\n\nAnyway, while you MAY be able to figure out who someone is based on their search history, it would be insanely impractical especially when you realize that device ID isn't just plainly someone's name, your computer isn't Steve's computer, it's Desktop 018473919374 or something to that effect.\n\nWhile I believe stripping privacy rights are a bad thing generally and this is a slippery slope, the most this specific action will amount to is you seeing more relevant ads when you're browsing the Internet, unless there's something massive I'm missing.\n\nSource:  I work in digital advertising\n\nEdit: a word",

If you blast out 1000x the number of requests than you normally would when necessary and these requests are the packet equivalent of white noise it becomes impossible to pick out the signal from the noise, demonstrably.\n\nBanning data aggregation as a principle is against the momentum and philosophy of the internet going back 30 years.  Using laws to legally impose this ban against ISP's collecting personal data may be reasonable on its own, but it fundamentally allows for similar bans on data aggregation in other sectors, fragmenting the internet and putting limits on the very thing that has made the internet as large as it is.\n\nThe real question is how to maintain a level of privacy on the internet acceptable to every user. The real \"tech answer\" is to create new technology to allow you to use the network as you wish, e.g. services that masquerade as your public identity and spam random corners of the internet and globe in your name, only you know which one is getting your interesting data\n\n Instead we are close to simultaneously constricting the market from two sides, security and encryption being put under suspicion under national security umbrella and data aggregation from a consumer rights perspective. What this means we don't allow a market for these tools to exist by pretending that data aggregation doesn't happen regardless of policy and locking down the technologies to make it less of a problem.

If you edit Wikipedia, the newly-created version of the page is stored in the wiki database along with the timestamp, user name of the person making the change, and a user-provided summary of the edit, if provided. All of this is publicly viewable by clicking the \"history\" tab at the top of the Wikipedia page.\n\nWhat makes this interesting is that Wikipedia allows you to still use the site without creating a user account (unlike Reddit, which will not allow you to make comments without logging in). It's just that since you have no account, and it has to put something in that field, it puts your IP address there.  If that IP belongs to the Pentagon, we know someone at the Pentagon made the change. And it's not just the Pentagon, you can find edits from government IPs ranging from Congressional offices to the Kansas Turnpike Authority. Some of these edits are sweeping things under the rug, some are helpful additions, and some are obviously bored staffers changing something unrelated to their agency.\n\nAmusingly, you're actually more identifiable by making an \"anonymous\" edit on Wikipedia. If they took five minutes to create an account with a username like Steve314159 there would be no trace of where he worked unless he made it obvious in some other way.",

There are 32,000 area codes * (365 days * 100 year age range * 2 sexes) = 2.3 billion combinations for a population of 310 million, meaning it's pretty likely that any random individual has a unique identifier. There are more combinations of birthdays * genders (73,000) than the population of most zip codes. You may know someone who shares your birthday, even a couple someones, but to match your birth year, zip code, and gender with them is pretty unlikely.\n\nThis doesn't take into account that some birth years are more frequent in the population than others, but you get the idea.\n\nEdit: according to zip-codes.com, the average population of a U.S. zip code is about 7,500. There are way more\n birthday combinations than that.  ",
