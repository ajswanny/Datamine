    "body": "#####From this report:\n\n>But **the intercepts alarmed American intelligence and law enforcement agencies, in part because of the** ***amount of contact*** **that was occurring while Mr. Trump was speaking glowingly about the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin.** At one point last summer, Mr. Trump said at a campaign event that he hoped Russian intelligence services had stolen Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails and would make them public.\n\n>**The officials said the intercepted communications were not limited to Trump campaign officials, and included other associates of Mr. Trump.** On the Russian side, the contacts also included members of the Russian government outside of the intelligence services, the officials said. All of the current and former officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because the continuing investigation is classified.\n\n>**The officials said that one of the advisers picked up on the calls was Paul Manafort**, who was Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign chairman for several months last year and had worked as a political consultant in Russia and Ukraine. The officials declined to identify the other Trump associates on the calls.\n\n>**The call logs and intercepted communications are part of a larger trove of information that the F.B.I. is sifting through as it investigates the links between Mr. Trump\u2019s associates and the Russian government, as well as the D.N.C. hack**, according to federal law enforcement officials. **As part of its inquiry, the F.B.I. has obtained banking and travel records and conducted interviews**, the officials said.\n\n>...\n\n>The intercepted calls are different from the wiretapped conversations last year between Michael T. Flynn, President Trump\u2019s former national security adviser, and Sergey I. Kislyak, the Russian ambassador to the United States. During those calls, which led to Mr. Flynn\u2019s resignation on Monday night, the two men discussed sanctions that the Obama administration imposed on Russia in December.\n\n>...\n\n>**The F.B.I. has closely examined at least four other people close to Mr. Trump**, although it is unclear if their calls were intercepted. They are **Carter Page**, a businessman and former foreign policy adviser to the campaign; **Roger Stone**, a longtime Republican operative; and **Mr. Flynn.**\n\n\n-----------\n\n#####David Corn\u2019s piece from earlier today:\n\n[The Question the White House Won't Answer: Did Trump's Campaign Have Contact With Russia?]( http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/02/sean-spicer-ducks-question-about-trump-campaign-contacts-with-russia)\n\n>Yet the **Washington Post reported days ago that Kislyak told the newspaper he had been in touch with Flynn since before the election.** The ambassador declined to say what he and Flynn had discussed. And the newspaper reported that the Flynn-Kislyak conversations \"were **part of a series of contacts between Flynn and Kislyak that began before the Nov. 8 election and continued during the transition**, officials said.\" These facts and Kislyak's comment **undercut Trump's and Pence's assertions there were no pre-election contacts.** \n\n>So what was Spicer to say when Karl posed this query? At first, Spicer said that Flynn did speak to the Russian ambassador during the transition. ***No, Karl protested, that's not the question.*** **What about** ***before*** **the election?** Spicer then sputtered out this reply: \n\n>\"***There's nothing that would conclude me that anything different has changed with respect to that time period.\"***\n\n>That **contorted reply** would seem to mean that the White House is sticking to its previous denial. But this assertion **runs contrary to what is now the public record**: that the Trump campaign was in contact with Putin's man in Washington while Putin was subverting an American election to help Trump. **What was going on? What was said? What messages did Flynn send to the Putin regime?** These are the obvious questions that warrant answers. **They are also dangerous questions for Trump.** And that's why Spicer cannot acknowledge the hard truth that the Flynn scandal started before the election. **These contacts deserve as much, if not more, attention than the conversations that triggered this controversy**, for they are relevant to the fundamental subject at hand: **Trump's relationship with the autocratic leader who mounted an operation to subvert American democracy to assist Trump.**\n\n\n---------\n\n#####[Other Spicer comments from today](http://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2017-02-14/trump-expects-russia-to-return-crimea-to-ukraine-white-house):\n\n>\"**President Trump has made it very clear that he expects the Russian government to de-escalate violence in the Ukraine and return Crimea**,\" Spicer said at a daily news briefing. \"At the same time, he fully expects to and wants to get along with Russia.\"\n\nReports from last year contradicting this newfound toughness on Russia:\n\n[How The Trump Campaign Weakened The Republican Platform On Aid To Ukraine](http://www.npr.org/2016/08/06/488876597/how-the-trump-campaign-weakened-the-republican-platform-on-aid-to-ukraine)\n\n[Trump campaign guts GOP\u2019s anti-Russia stance on Ukraine](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/global-opinions/trump-campaign-guts-gops-anti-russia-stance-on-ukraine/2016/07/18/98adb3b0-4cf3-11e6-a7d8-13d06b37f256_story.html?utm_term=.e9ffd4bf615c)\n\n[Trump Campaign Changed Ukraine Platform, Lied About It](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/08/03/trump-campaign-changed-ukraine-platform-lied-about-it.html)\n\n[Did Trump campaign soften platform language to benefit Russia?]\n(http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2016/aug/04/did-trump-campaign-soften-platform-language-benefi/)\n\n--------\n\n#####Roger Stone *admitted* to having contact with Wikileaks:\n\nOn October 12, 2016, [Stone told a CBS affiliate in Miami](http://miami.cbslocal.com/2016/10/12/trump-ally-roger-stone-admits-back-channel-tie-to-wikileaks/amp/?utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=amp&utm_source=www.miamiherald.com-RelayMediaAMP):\n\n>\"I do have a back-channel communication with Assange, because we have a good mutual friend\u201d \n\n-----\n\n#####Also from this current NYT piece re: the Steele Dossier:\n\n>**As part of the inquiry, the F.B.I. is also trying to assess the credibility of information contained in a dossier that was given to the bureau last year by a former British intelligence operative.** The dossier contained a raft of salacious allegations about connections between Mr. Trump, his associates and the Russian government.

Sees No Clear Link to Russia](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/14/us/politics/russia-intelligence-communications-trump.html):\n\n> For much of the summer, the F.B.I. pursued a widening investigation into a Russian role in the American presidential campaign. Agents scrutinized advisers close to Donald J. Trump, looked for financial connections with Russian financial figures, searched for those involved in hacking the computers of Democrats, and even chased a lead \u2014 which they ultimately came to doubt \u2014 about a possible secret channel of email communication from the Trump Organization to a Russian bank.\n> \n> Law enforcement officials say that none of the investigations so far have found any conclusive or direct link between Mr. Trump and the Russian government. And even the hacking into Democratic emails, F.B.I. and intelligence officials now believe, was aimed at disrupting the presidential election rather than electing Mr. Trump.\n\nThat was just a day after the New York Times dedicated the entire above-the-fold of their front page to Comey's announcement that he had found some emails he hadn't yet obtained a warrant to read.\n\nI'm glad we're getting this information now, but the elective leaks by the FBI leading up to the election were horrendous.",

We knew they were investigating, but confirmed information isn't something they typically leak or put out unless its corroborated. All the stuff with Flynn was just the tip of the snowball and now it's roling down the hill like an avalanche. If news is breaking like this, expect it to get even crazier if they have more to confirm.\n\nThe other factor is, in the wake of hostility towards the media and even denial of access, the press has finally turned the corner back to investigative journalism. I made a comment a few weeks back that this is how the media would make Trump and his administration pay for all the lack of access and straight up attacks on their credibility and we're starting to see it bear out.\n\nBoth of these make it really, really hard for the GOP-controlled Congress not to do something.

Rather, his goal is to spread chaos and distrust throughout the world's political structure, making Russia a more important player overall and making it easier to situate Russia into good positions. \n\nSo far, it's worked like a charm. \n\nTrump has systematically crapped on every ally he comes in contact with, consistently wreaks economic woe anytime he calls out a company on Twitter, stoked hatred and fear of minorities and Muslims to the point where over half of Republicans want to perform a religious test on incoming refugees, and shown that the United States will happily vote in a freaking demagogue over nothing more than a politician using a private server. He's shown that we'll burn our entire system of government down because of fake internet stories. \n\nPutin won the second Trump's name was announced as the winner of the election. He could be impeached now and it wouldn't make a difference to Putin. The war is won. \n\nWhat's scarier rather, is the fact that you now have other demagogues and fascists (see the alt-right) that know it's not only possible to hijack a major political party, but actually win the presidency while doing it. \n\nAmerican democracy has forever been weakened because people who legitimately want to strip our rights away from us (I think Trump is a bit of an idiot who bought into these far-right ideas without really understanding the full consequences) are sitting here going \"If someone that dumb, and that blatantly obvious can do it, think about what someone who's actually politically savvy can do.\" \n\nWe on the left have this problem of viewing people like Trump and Bannon as these isolated little incidents popping up here and there, but in reality, they're a chain. \n\nThey come one after the other, getting smarter, and smarter. Over and over. Until eventually that chain is wrapped around your neck and choking you. If you don't believe me, just look at what the evangelicals have done in the past 20 years. They're every bit the religious extremists as the Islamists in Egypt were (I'm Muslim btw), the difference is they've been allowed into government, so they don't have to resort to violence. Instead, they start by giving money, buying off politicians. Then, they start winning local elections. State elections, next thing you know they're winning governorship after governorship. \n\nThey're funding Christian colleges that preach that it's a Christian's religious duty to go into politics to shape the American government into God's kingdom on Earth. Not democracy, KINGDOM on Earth. They graduate thousands and thousands of politically savvy, educated voters. \n\nAnd what's the endgame? Religious fascism. American fascism. Science stripped out of schools in favor of religious text, environmental regulations rolled back, a voting electorate that does everything it can to keep out \"the other\" for fear of religious differences, the tearing down of the separation of church and state, the annihilation of abortion rights, and the real prize: private charter schools to make sure they can squash out public schools and the \"liberal agenda.\" Get to the children so that the cycle never stops. The Kingdom will be built from the first grade up. \n\nLook who our Secretary of Education is and tell me that hasn't worked. \n\nTrump is the best weapon they've ever had. Too dumb to notice, so good at drawing our anger, at distracting us. So good at bringing out everything they've ever wanted from their voters. Anger, fear, pride, jealousy. \n\nRemoving Trump removes one link in the chain. But it's already around our throats. ",

    "body": "> We on the left have this problem of viewing people like Trump and Bannon as these isolated little incidents popping up here and there, but in reality, they're a chain.\n\nI think it's scary to consider the impact of Trump/Bannon on the global political climate. France is gonna have Presidential elections this year and the fascist Marine Le Pen could very well win the election. Le Pen is explicitly anti immigrant and anti Muslim. It seems like Trump's win has shown her that she too can win a major Western democratic election running a xenophobic campaign. A Le Pen win would use the Trump strategy of going after immigrants and Muslims, making the marginalized even more marginalized. \n\nThe Dutch elections are a month from now. Geert Wilders so called Party for Freedom (PVV) is expected to win the most seats. Geert Wilders has said their should be less Moroccans in the Netherlands. In 2007 the PVV suggested banning Muslims immigrants from entering the Netherlands. \n\nMeanwhile Mauricio Macri the President of Argentina, is pushing for deportations. Like Trump Macri claims it is immigrants from poorer countries that are responsible for all the crimes being committed. It's absurd these two leaders are so anti immigrant when they are both the sons of immigrants. \n\nI hope the Left is gonna be able to combat this worldwide fascist resurgence. I think it's gonna take a coordinated unified effort to defeat these fascists.  I believe we're at a critical point where we have an opportunity to organize the masses and start some kind of grassroots resistance. I'm not sure what it will look like but as an American it seems like that's what's been happening here since Trump won. \n\n https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/04/world/americas/argentinas-trump-like-immigration-order-rattles-south-america.html\n\nhttp://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/2017/02/15/geert-wilders-narrow-lead-netherlands-gears-elections",
