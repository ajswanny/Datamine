If I was an accord member, I'd say the USA put everyone else on unfair ground and simply say, \"Hey, let's just buy from other members - we don't need the USA anyway!\" And then, because I'm mad at the USA, I'd vote to keep them out of the club. \n\nThe business leaders are worried about this same thing too. That's why they are trying to distance themselves - they don't want the EU, China, etc to shun the USA.\n\nI never liked Trump, but I wanted him to succeed for the world's sake. I wanted him to be good and prove me wrong. I'm really saddened that the GOP hasn't stood up and told him how to be a president. I blame the entire GOP for America's problems today - health care, education, foreign relations, problems with the internet, civil forfeiture,  and now the environment. I will always blame the GOP for these. I will reflect back upon this time in my life and refer to the years between 2008 and 2016 as \"the good ol' days\" when the internet was open and free, when we were on a solid path to better health care, and education only put you in debt for 15 years after graduation.

In the event that the costume item cannot be replaced that person does not go into the park. Also all cast members drop their costumes off at the end of the day, resulting in about 1.8 million items needed to be cleaned in the run of a year. Disney also operates the largest laundry facility in the world.\n* Disney sells a ton of food and drink but one thing you'll never find for sale is gum, this is to keep it from ending up on rides or in other areas.

That's just highly impractical, because then you can never, ever move that trash can. It HAS to be there forever. \n* The vending machine thing isn't that big of a deal. It just had simple things like socks or razors (if you forgot to shave). The thing with the costumes having to be perfect isn't a big deal, either. It's more like \"Oh you forgot your black shoes at home? No, you can't wear the hot pink Nikes you're wearing right now out on stage. Sorry, we'll just send you home instead.\" It's just for a consistent look. \n* Cast members do not HAVE to drop their costumes off at the end of the day. In fact, most do not. You're totally allowed to take your work costume (aka your uniform) home with you, and you can even launder it yourself at home if you don't want to lose the one you have for whatever reason. This is what most cast do. They wear their costumes to and from work. The only time I can think of where you had to drop it off at the end of the day was with the new Guardians of the Galaxy ride that just opened. Disney was being very secretive about the ride and all of its details (including the costumes), so those cast members could only travel backstage in their costumes (unless going to get food briefly), and then couldn't take them home until the day the ride opened to the public.

He pushed for a lot of shitty sequels and direct to VHS movies which was a stark contrast to the high quality of entertainment Walt demanded back in the day. This resulted in the decline and eventual death of the 2D animation department. IIRC Pixar wouldn't negotiate being bought by Disney until Eisner was gone. There are probably books written about the subject, but I can't remember all the details. The longtime Disney fans hated him for tainting the legacy in a sense. ",

The slightest variation in salinity, temperature, & acidity of the ocean alone would spell the end for most life on this planet. It's essentially a domino/runaway effect. Climate change is already collapsing ecosystems, and without a reliable source of energy (I.e calories from food sources) it's game over. \n\nAlso consider this: human growth is exponential. The amount of land that can sustain farming is shrinking drastically & are turning into arid swaths of land. Combine this with the collapse of ecosystems & thus less food sources, and you're looking at mass migration along with global conflict over resources. This will put a further strain on the remaining resources as well. \n\nHomo sapiens are really not as adaptable as you might think, and I don't just mean human society. We rely on a very specific set of conditions in order to survive as a species, and to be frank when you really start digging into the science & data regarding climate change it paints a bleak outlook for our survival (even when taking into account human ingenuity). \n\nApologies but I'm too lazy to go into more depth regarding this topic, but there's plenty of information on this subject for those interested.

I think it's clear we haven't held up the bargain of successfully educating the population - critical-thinking wise - that is asked of us when trying to create a healthy, functioning democracy, which no doubt thrives amongst debate and diverse opinions - but only when those opinions share a common base of objective fact. \n\nThe fact that a subset of the population has become so disdainful that they want to lash out at their objectively factual reality, and take the rest of the world down with them, is a problem, and it behooves us to address this with compassion and understanding. But at what point will we fall back on self preservation? Look at how much the US has been diminished in just a short amount of time.\n\nI still strongly believe in liberal democracy, and to raise doubts about it is clearly one of Putins goals. But I do wonder if perhaps 20th century factors - greed, dogma, the failures that capitalism couldn't address or may have caused - have led to its premature undoing, and maybe we will actually need AI to save us. Just being fanciful, but maybe that is the next step for the next phase of society, and then a truly healthy democracy can emerge from that if society has made itself into a post-scarcity, more empathetic, and more equal entity.\n\n",

It was a family-owned company and every year at Christmas he would distribute shares and dividends to family members. I was curious about what stock was and my grandfather explained it all to me. I was a Disney fan (and still am, though my relationship with the company is more complex these days. It's almost like an abusive relationship - I love Disney, but he hits me). So I got it in my head that I wanted to own a very small piece of Disney. Back in those days, stockholders also became a member of the Magic Kingdom Club (which no longer exists) which gave you a few discounts and perks in the parks. Extra E tickets! Those were for the best rides, before it was all on a pass.",

The Walt Disney Family Museum acknowledges that ethnic stereotypes common to films of the 1930s were included in some early cartoons.  Disney donated regularly to Jewish charities, he was named \"1955 Man of the Year\" by the B'nai B'rith chapter in Beverly Hills, and his studio employed a number of Jews, some of whom were in influential positions.  Gabler, the first writer to gain unrestricted access to the Disney archives, concludes that the available evidence did not support accusations of anti-semitism and that Disney was \"not [anti-semitic] in the conventional sense that we think of someone as being an anti-Semite\". Gabler concludes that \"though Walt himself, in my estimation, was not anti-Semitic, nevertheless, he willingly allied himself with people who were anti-Semitic [meaning the Motion Picture Alliance for the Preservation of American Ideals], and that reputation stuck. He was never really able to expunge it throughout his life\". Disney distanced himself from the Motion Picture Alliance in the 1950s.",
