He is just saying that the EU will not cut ties with the U.S. over this one disagreement.\n\nEDIT2: EU President is not a \"real\" office.

Trump believes that all benefits are reached through competition, every interaction is win-lose, and no agreement/cooperation can benefit everyone involved.  Therefore, because America is \"the best\" country, entering into an agreement with other countries can only hurt us: we have nothing to gain from cooperation that we can't just take.\n\nHowever, the more explicit reason he gave: he doesn't like (as other Republicans like Bush have also disliked) the fact that developing countries are allowed to set lower goals for their emissions reductions than the US.  This is because they see it as exerting an \"equalizing\" force to disadvantage the US.  Particularly, he has continued to harp on US coal, and falsely claimed the US will not be able to open new coal plants with the agreement while other countries can, sending US jobs over sees.\n\nAs a personal matter, I suspect Trump likes the idea of distinguishing himself from other world leaders as part of his \"outsider\" perspective, and dislikes signing on to an agreement negotiated by Obama because he has so often said Obama is bad at negotiating, and he is good at negotiating.\n\nFinally, he doesn't personally believe in climate change, and is throwing a boon to republican leaders, who cannot admit to climate change because of their fossil fuel backers and because 1/4 of the American voting public are evangelical Christians, who do not believe in global warming for the same reason they don't believe in evolution: because God made the earth to be perfect and unchanging.",

The court would find the state in violation of the constitution, The court would then set a date by which the state must alter its laws so that it is no longer in violation of the constitution.\n\nAssuming the state outright refuses to comply with the court order even after fines and such are issued for non compliance there's two broad options that i'm aware of 1: If the attorney generals office supports to supreme courts decision and the governor still refuses, said governor would be indicted under state law and relieved of their office. Then the states attorney generals office would work with the acting governor to fix the states laws so they comply with the constitution. Usually by having that states highest court formally recognize the federal court order and thus ruling said laws illegal by a court with direct state authority.\n\n2: If the states attorney generals office sides with the state then the governor is charged with contempt under federal law for failing to comply with the supreme courts order. The US marshals would then be dispatched to arrest the governor.\n\nIn a situation where even after a governor has been arrested and the state still refuses to comply in all likelihood yes military intervention is a viable option to the administration, because at that point its open insurrection as the state is violation of the constitution and refusing to recognize the authority of federal government and the highest court in the country. that the state is acting in its best interests regarding climate change is irrelevant. \n\nIn addition to domestic solutions the federal government would likely issue statements and strongly worded letters to international party and possibly even seek to implement sanctions in an attempt to put an end to the treaties.",
