He confirmed that Putin/Russia was closely tied to the Trump campaign;\n\n\n[You can watch his testimony on CSPAN](https://www.c-span.org/video/?431852-1/william-browder-overturning-magnitsky-act-putins-top-priority). It paints an incredible picture of how the Russian government operates.\n\n[Written transcript from The Atlantic - Bill Browder's Testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/07/bill-browders-testimony-to-the-senate-judiciary-committee/534864/)\n\n\n>Natalia Veselnitskaya, the Russian lawyer who secured a meeting with Donald Trump Jr., Jared Kushner, and Paul Manafort, was engaged in a campaign for the repeal of the Magnitsky Act, and raised the subject of adoptions in that meeting. That\u2019s put the spotlight back on Browder\u2019s long campaign for Kremlin accountability, and against corruption\u2014a campaign whose success has irritated Putin and those around him.\n\nRussian sanctions, and in particular the Magnitsky Act, provides us with a motive. \n\n[The Atlantantic - Why Does the Kremlin Care So Much About the Magnitsky Act?](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2017/07/magnitsky-act-kremlin/535044/) \n\n\nLearning about Papadopoulos provides a timeline that can be confirmed - Trump's campaign knew about the hacked emails before the then candidate's famous joke about releasing the hacked emails. I'd also like to point out that while the indictments did not refer to President Trump, it listed \"others\" implying more are yet to come. The indictment also lists Papadopoulos as a proactive witness. This Atlantic article about Trump Jr. working with Julian Assange further corroborates the notion that the campaign knew of the hacked emails before they were released. \n\n[The Hill - Campaign knew Russia had Clinton emails months before Trump 'joke'](http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/357851-timeline-campaign-knew-russia-had-clinton-emails-months-before-trump)\n\nJared Kushner was in charge of the Trump campaign's digital operation.\n\n[McClatchy - Trump-Russia investigators probe Jared Kushner-run digital operation](http://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/nation-world/national/article160803619.html)\n\n>Investigators at the House and Senate Intelligence committees and the Justice Department are examining whether the Trump campaign\u2019s digital operation \u2013 overseen by Jared Kushner \u2013 helped guide Russia\u2019s sophisticated voter targeting and fake news attacks on Hillary Clinton in 2016.\n\n\n\n\n",

We have an unusual idea,\u201d Wikileaks wrote on October 21, 2016. \u201cLeak us one or more of your father\u2019s tax returns.\u201d Wikileaks then laid out three reasons why this would benefit both the Trumps and Wikileaks. One, The New York Times had already published a fragment of Trump\u2019s tax returns on October 1; two, the rest could come out any time \u201cthrough the most biased source (e.g. NYT/MSNBC).\u201d\n> \n> It is the third reason, though, Wikileaks wrote, that \u201cis the real kicker.\u201d \u201cIf we publish them it will dramatically improve the perception of our impartiality,\u201d Wikileaks explained. \u201cThat means that the vast amount of stuff that we are publishing on Clinton will have much higher impact, **because it won\u2019t be perceived as coming from a \u2018pro-Trump\u2019 \u2018pro-Russia\u2019 source.\u201d** \n\nThis is huge and maybe the most serious thing about these messages. Wikileaks looking out for itself to improve the perception of impartiality, only so their Clinton leaks would have higher impact. \n\nWikileaks is compromised beyond all doubt. There is no impartiality and there has probably never been any. Fuck Assange (who's still escaping law like a coward after he sexually assaulted two women)!\n\nEDIT: Another point, since WL is most likely compromised by GRU, who's to say that that Trump Jr didn't actually communicate with them and not really Assange?\n\nPS: Is this where Trump's talking points about \"It's all rigged!!\" and \"if Clinton wins Trump won't concede\" came from? \n\nPS2: Bannon, Kellyanne Conway, Brad Parscale, Kushner and Hope Hicks all knew about this from Trump Jr. WL had already published stolen DNC documents when this happened. \n \nEDIT 2: \n\n[Seth Abramson:](https://twitter.com/SethAbramson/status/930195369010614272)\n\n> Any time you see in the news that an email about Russia was sent to this person\u2014HOPE HICKS\u2014it means that email was seen by TRUMP. \n> \n> Don Jr., Papadopoulos, Page, and others appear to have used Hicks as an \"email launderer\"\u2014she shows emails to Trump he can later claim he never saw.\n\n> 3/ On February 16, 2017, Trump said he had \"nothing to do with\" WikiLeaks. But it's clear his son sent Hope Hicks secret WikiLeaks messages in September 2016 so she'd show them to ~~her~~ his father\u2014who doesn't use email. So Trump almost certainly lied about this.",

Think about it, the dems had tried to make Trump's refusal to release his tax returns a huge issue in the election.  Imagine if Wikileaks had released the tax returns, and they were clean.  Or even like some expected tax loophole stuff but nothing actionable.\n\nNot only would it, as Assange suggests, give the appearance of impartiality to Wikileaks, it would also torpedo a huge vector of attack from the dems on Trump.\n\nSo why not do it?  Because the tax returns are so incriminating that even being leaked under favorable conditions would still be enough to bring down his candidacy.",
