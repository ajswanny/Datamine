Mr. Trump warmly greeted Mr. Kislyak and three other foreign ambassadors who came to the reception.\n\n> Kislyak, according to multiple contemporaneous news reports, was [seated in the front row](http://www.rferl.org/a/us-trump-foreign-policy-speech-russia/27702091.html). It was an invitation-only event.\n\nThis seems like an important revelation.\n\n> Trump used the speech to call for warmer relations with Russia.\n\nHe has used every speech to do this, though, to be fair.",

Why would Page obfuscate for weeks before eventually admitting to meeting with Kislyak? Why did Trump say he hasn't talked to Russia in a decade yet met with Kislyak last year?\n\nThis is all besides the point that when you delve deeper you find even more reasons to be suspicious, specifically as it pertains to blatant connections between Trump's lackeys and pro-Putin Ukrainian lawmakers/party leaders.

    "body": "I'm not a Trump supporter, but from the article it looks like the Russian ambassador attended a speech and a reception. Are we sure that is a big deal? This is far different from a private meeting, no? Are people asserting that at a reception that presumably included dozens of people, Trump was huddling in a corner whispering with the ambassador? Is it a serious offense to just be in the same room with the guy?\n\nCan someone explain how this even counts as \"contact\" because maybe I'm naive but I don't see it.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I do believe that there are damning ties to Russia someplace with regards to Trump, but at least from my reading of the article, I am very dubious this event qualifies. \n\nEDIT: It should also give us all pause that the NY Times, the ones that originally reported on this, haven't tried to push the narrative that this counts as evidence that Trump lied about contact with the Russians. It's ThinkProgress that's pushing that angle. One has to ask, if this is so damning, why isn't the Times pushing this story?",

Even if we win every seat in the senate we will need 10 republican votes to remove him and we are very unlikely to win every seat up in 2018.\n\nnah the right will try to sweep this under the rug and slowly but surely trump will get rid of people in the IC investigating this shit.\n\ndont forget we have more than enough evidence to show bush litterally lied us into a war that killed thousands of americans and cost us trillions of dollars. We know for a fact his admin wanted to attack iraq before 911. We know for a fact the admin tried to link 911 to iraq. We know for a fact they withheld info from congress. we know for a fact members of the admin outed an active cia agent because they dared showed the yellow cake doc was a bad fake.. and the right said that wasnt the crime.. that the evidence for war was fake..no the crime was a cia agent was married to another cia agent and somehow they had power over the entire cia to send him to find out the document was fake..  as if plame made the fake doc. What happened to them? squat.",

This administration is not going to hold an entire country accountable for a few rogue assholes with computers.\"  \n\nIf Team Trump came out and said something like that, this issue might go away. Just imagine, if Trump didn't commit impeachable act regarding the Russians, how happy he has to be right now. Some of his stooges get shit canned, who cares? Reddit is littered with posts about Trump and Russia, but I've only seen two posts about the pack of shitty bills Republicans just sent to various committees:\n\n1. HR 861 Terminate the Environmental Protection Agency\n2. HR 610 Vouchers for Public Education\n3. HR 899 Terminate the Department of Education\n4. HJR 69 Repeal Rule Protecting Wildlife\n5.

HR 147 Criminalizing Abortion (\u201cPrenatal Nondiscrimination Act\u201d)\n10. HR 808 Sanctions against Iran\n\nI'm absolutely not saying that the Russia business doesn't deserve a  major investigation. All I want to bring up is that, finding enough evidence to prove the Trump Campaign colluded with Russia, linking that to Trump, getting the House to agree to the charges, and getting a 2/3's majority in the Senate to finalize his removal from office; doing all of that is a humongous Hail Mary.\n\nMaybe we should spend a few more minutes a day worrying about the small battles.

And their sense of identification with Hitler, their trust in him, made it easier to widen this gap and reassured those who would otherwise have worried about it.\n\n>\"This separation of government from people, this widening of the gap, took place so gradually and so insensibly, each step disguised (perhaps not even intentionally) as a temporary emergency measure or associated with true patriotic allegiance or with real social purposes. And all the crises and reforms (real reforms, too) so occupied the people that they did not see the slow motion underneath, of the whole process of government growing remoter and remoter. [Source](http://press.uchicago.edu/Misc/Chicago/511928.html)\n\nOkay so I'm a little confused as to why making the Trump-Hitler comparison is considered off topic. We're supposed to learn from history and not repeat it, instead what we have in the US is a nearly identical situation to what this book, written in 1955, is describing. Like this is literally Hitler in the making, it's fucking happening exactly as laid out here. ",

Wikileaks then publishes that string of numbers with the data, info, whatever it is they're publishing at that time, and when you download the same software they originally used and run the document through it on your end, it should generate the same string of numbers. I think Julian Assanges specific personal key makes a difference in how the algorithm that scans the software functions, but that's the gist of it. \n\n\nIf the strings don't match then the data has been altered in some way since when it was originally received/released by Wikileaks. Now the Wikileaks insurance file was announced and the hash (the string of numbers from earlier) was posted publicly on their twitter with the context of \"if things ever go south at Wikileaks then a file is set to go life on this date, use these numbers to verify its the real deal\". When the file was released to the public the hash that end users generated did not match the one originally posted by Wikileaks and therefor the data has to have changed, meaning Wikileaks had been compromised. \n\n\nPlease forgive me for any inaccuracies, I'm not a computer scientist and this is my vague understanding of the subject through work and some hobbying around.
