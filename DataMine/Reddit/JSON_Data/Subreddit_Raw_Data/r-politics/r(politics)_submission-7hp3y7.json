Trump owes the bank about $300m in loans that were extended to him before he became president.\n\n>The Guardian reported in February that the bank had launched a review of Trump\u2019s account earlier this year to gauge whether there were any connections to Russia and had not discovered anything suspicious.\n\n>Ivanka Trump, the president\u2019s daughter and adviser in the White House; her husband, Jared Kushner, who is also a presidential adviser; and Kushner\u2019s mother, Seryl Stadtmauer, are all clients of Deutsche Bank.",

But I think it's also an extremely likely scenario. \n\nWe're clearly rushing toward a showdown between the administration and the Special Counsel, and it's going to come to a head sooner rather than later. Trump is for sure gearing up for a fight, and given Mueller's history (and everything we know about him) he's not going to go down/back down silently. And all of us, and a floundering Congress, are going to be stuck in the crosshairs as we implore our government to do their jobs. \n\nBuckle up. It's going to be one hell of a ride from here. ",

Since Trump has a loooooong history of financial dealings with Russia, that's immediately in scope.\n\nIn the simplest terms, Mueller went to the judge and said, \"I have this bucket of leads from witnesses A - Z and here is their testimony. You can see in their testimony, they give specifics of the records I need as evidence to support their testimony.   Do you approve this subpoena of Duetsche bank for these related financial records?\"\n\nJudge replies, \"Yes.\"\n\nEdit: Crazy Germans and their usage of \"eu\".  I'm keeping it.",

    "body": "There is a proven psychological correlation between showing someone direct evidence that irrefutably contradicts their point of view and that person eventually just rationalizing it in the context of their incorrect opinion, and then doubling down on it. Humans are really good at adapting to the trying circumstances. I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll ever fully flip the die hards but the rest of them are vulnerable, provided you attack their misconceptions in the right way. All of our beliefs are held emotionally first, and factually second. You generally can\u2019t pry the first layer away without some emotional tool. It\u2019s like using a disguise to get into a super deep bunker vs endlessly blasting away at the door. To apply this to the context, this is why you see Republicans suddenly do full 180s on issues as soon as they\u2019re emotionally interacting with them. Someone\u2019s son is gay, someone\u2019s wife would have died without an abortion, someone\u2019s nephew needs Obamacare for his preexisting conditions and bam, all the rhetoric and falsehoods melt away and they change their mind. \n\nWhen you approach someone\u2019s emotional beliefs with factual arguments, the best result that you can hope for is a temporary moment of doubt before they rearrange things to make the belief work again. It just galvanizes their holding because you\u2019ve now inoculated their belief against a valid and true counterargument, defeating any attempt at using it in the future. Further, losing factual debates is often humiliating, which will result in an immediate deterioration of any dialogue. People tend to get angry and resent when they\u2019ve been upset. This new political right has a particular favor \u201ccounterpunching.\u201d An uncivil yelling match is exactly how they can make themselves the victor because they will most certainly shout louder. \n\nTo yank somebody out of this cult, it has to be done emotionally. You need to go to your republican grandparents and explain an issue in a context of how if affects *you*, their *grandchild*, and therefore, how it affects them, your *grandparents*, too. Be really careful though; you\u2019re wearing emotion like a disguise and you need to behave in fashion that doesn\u2019t tingle their \u201clibcuck alert.\u201d Don\u2019t use buzzwords, DO NOT MENTION HILLARY CLINTON, don\u2019t start with the broadside arguments and talking points. Don\u2019t touch abortion. Don\u2019t touch race relations. Anything with an emotional tie that founds the belief is a no go. Purely factual arguments or issues are the best.  Go for offbeat policy issues, like renewable energy or Net neutrality. The Russia thing is a good one to start with, because it has no emotional root with anybody. Get the full story before you approach them. I mean every detail start to finish from Trump back in 2013 when he ran Ms. Universe in Moscow, to right now. Prepare yourself with the basic answers to the right wing talking points. They want to paint this whole thing as an imaginary conspiracy to take them down so even the slightest factual error is devastating. Don\u2019t get frustrated, be patient. Slowly unravel the entire web to them in a nonpartisan fashion. Once you do that, and you\u2019ve got a thread to pull, you can begin to undermine every other argument and position by using that as a seed of doubt. \n\nEdited in the middle bit there",
