The private account was described in former Newsweek reporter Harry Hurt III\u2019s 1993 book, Lost Tycoon. It details the alleged \"violent assault,\" in which Trump pulled out fistfuls of his ex-wife\u2019s hair after receiving a painful operation on his scalp.\n\n\nIvana walked back her allegations against Trump after his lawyers insisted she write the following statement at the beginning of her book, according to The New York Times: \"During a deposition given by me in connection with my matrimonial case, I stated that my husband had raped me. I referred to this as a 'rape,' but I do not want my words to be interpreted in a literal or criminal sense.\"\n\nA former Trump business associate, Jill Harth, claimed in a 1997 lawsuit the New York real estate mogul \u201cattempted rape\u201d and groped her without her consent on various occasions. In the suit, Harth described a violent encounter at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort, in which Trump allegedly threw her against the wall of one of his children\u2019s bedrooms before lifting up her dress.\n\nIt was a shocking thing to have him do this, because he knew I was with George [her partner], he knew they were in the next room,\" she recalled in an October 2016 interview with The Guardian. \"How could he be doing this when I'm there for business?\"\n\nIn the pre-election interview, Harth maintained her allegations against Trump despite having withdrawn her lawsuit against him after he settled a separate suit her partner filed over a business dispute.\n\nMichael Cohen, his former lawyer and top aide, defended him against Ivana Trump\u2019s claims, saying, \"**By the very definition, you can't rape your spouse.**\"\n\nThe president has also been accused of sexual harassment or assault by at least 16 women.\n\n",

There was no second to put a robe on or any sort of clothing or anything. Some girls were topless. Other girls were naked\" \n\nI have arrived, yes it is me, Donald. Thank you, and I was not sure, because, no you don't have to cover yourself up. I was caught in traffic coming from the airport and, let me tell you this, airports just aren't the same as they used to be. My father, he flew a lot, as a kid I remember flying a lot too, and other people they have told me that they too have flown many times over the years. And these airports, these guys, they're just pointing at empty plane roads. I can point, look right now, I'm pointing at you miss who must be cold because you are pointing back at me. And these guys they would not let my diamond crested, and I know I'm a bit late showing up here. But, these guys they were pointing at the plan road and they pointed my diamond crested solid baby teeth jet to the wrong airplane garage. And for 20 , 30 years now, my jet has had no trouble being pointed to the right garage. And my garage at home can fit three planes but, they can't point me to the right, but, my garage at home is just filled with 1,500 donkey kong arcade machines. And they can't point my plane to the right garage. And so, and then on the way here I was really hungry and so we stopped off at this beautiful golden restaraunt, because I am the Donald and, oh that's a very nice bikini bottom, it would look better if you angled your legs around my face. And this restaraunt has a golden M, and not many people know, because this is a secret but, I will tell you girls, I'll tell you this and you can quote me on this because I have said it and these things that I say I say true things. This golden M restaraunt changed it's name to fit my own name as they saw how much I enjoyed their food. This \"Mac Donalds\" and they saw me smiling, I have a beautiful smile, just look at me smiling at your perky breasts, those are lovely. And the french fries were lovely too, these little shoelace, with just the right amount of salt. I don't like too much salt, I am not salty. And they saw me smiling so much, and I said, you know, this meal, this meal here. This golden burger and fries and this pop, if I could have a transformer with this, this would make me happy. This would be Donalds Happy Meal. And you know, I bet because I am so influential and they enjoyed experiencing me and my presence there so much. I bet you that they use that idea and make it their own. But, know this, you, yes you who needs a better waxer, it was I that made the McDonald's Happy Meal, and if my jet had not been late and made me hungry, you would not be able to thank me for this wonderful idea that I thought of all on my own. So you're welcome. Now, are we getting this orgy started or what? I need to go back and see if I can get Bumblebee. ",

Specifically, I categorized those allegations under \"voyeurism\", which is what the alleged activity constitutes.\n\nThe US Justice Department defines sexual assault as \u201cany type of sexual contact or behavior that occurs without the explicit consent of the recipient.\u201d This includes forced sexual intercourse, forcible sodomy, child molestation, incest, fondling, and attempted rape. According to the National Institute of Justice, sexual assault can also include voyeurism, exposure to exhibitionism, and undesired exposure to pornography.\n\nI think the language we use to describe the accusations is really important, and should be consistent with how it might be investigated by law enforcement. ^BP",

I was listening on the radio the other day, they were interviewing local people about Ray Moore. One of the people they interviewed was a female, and she said that (paraphrase) \"she didn't really care if he did anything strange to women because it was a long time ago and if he's truly sorry for it then God will forgive him\"  Sexual misconduct or downright creepiness has no impact on how they feel about candidates. The only thing that matters is that R or D next to their name. 17 woman could testify in court that Donald Trump molested them, and the majority of Republicans would be happy believing that it is just a smear campaign and that every single one of those women is lying.

Dershowitz defended Epstein amid an investigation into his involvement with underage girls more than a decade ago, and it was Acosta\u2014then the U.S. attorney overseeing south Florida\u2014who allowed Epstein\u2019s case to be resolved in state court in 2008.\n\n-\n\n> A Freedom of Information Act request for Secret Service records of visits Clinton may have made to Epstein\u2019s Little St. James Island produced no such evidence. However, Epstein\u2019s own lawyers once sought to capitalize on his ties to the former president, claiming during plea negotiations a decade ago that the financier \u201cwas part of the original group that conceived the Clinton Global Initiative\u201d\u2014a\n\n> **In addition, Clinton and Hollywood guests including Kevin Spacey and Chris Tucker toured AIDS projects in Africa in 2002 aboard a 727 jet Epstein owned.**\n\n> A spokeswoman for Clinton did not respond to a request for comment.\n\n> Clinton\u2019s ties to Epstein became an issue during the recent presidential race. Reince Priebus, then chairman of the Republican National Committee, was among Republicans who demanded a full accounting of the former president\u2019s dealings with Epstein. \u201cWhen you hang out with a guy who has a reputation like Jeffrey Epstein, multiple times, on private jets, on weekends, on trips, on places at least where it\u2019s been reported not very good things happen, it would be good to know what our former president was doing, especially because it appears he\u2019s going to be part of a campaign ticket on the other side of the aisle,\u201d Priebus told Bloomberg in 2015.\n\nAll these rich fucks are pervs and rapists, or their enablers and defenders.

And yet if you talk to Donald Trump, a different Epstein emerges. **\u201cI\u2019ve known Jeff for fifteen years. Terrific guy,\u201d Trump booms from a speakerphone. \u201cHe\u2019s a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it \u2014 Jeffrey enjoys his social life.\u201d**   [Source:  Snopes.](https://www.snopes.com/2016/06/23/donald-trump-rape-lawsuit/).\n\nFor his part, Epstein is a convicted pedophile, billionaire and registered sex offender who has settled *multiple lawsuits.*\n\n>   Epstein has been named in multiple similar lawsuits over the last several years, served 13 months in jail, and is registered as a sex offender for life:\n\n>    Billionaire sex offender Jeffrey Epstein has paid another accuser.\n\n>    **The 56-year-old money manager has quietly settled with Jane Doe 102, an unnamed woman who alleged in federal court in Florida that Epstein had induced her to \u201cserve his every sexual whim\u201d from the time she was 15 until she was 19.** The woman also claimed Epstein had flown her around the world, **paying her \u201cto be sexually exploited by [his friends] \u2026 including royalty, politicians, academicians [and] businessmen.\u201d**\n\n>    Epstein flatly denied those charges. But a source close to the financier confirms \u201cthe matter has been resolved to the satisfaction of both parties.\u201d The woman\u2019s lawyer, Robert Josefsberg, wouldn\u2019t say how much she\u2019s getting. Epstein had in the past offered accusers a minimum of $150,000.\n\n>    **Epstein has settled at least two other civil suits but still faces more than a dozen from women who claim he sexually abused them as minors at his Palm Beach mansion.**\n\n\nThe FACT that they are identified as 'Jane Doe' is standard court procedure when the plaintiff/victim is a MINOR.  It is not indicative that the case has less merit, it is for the protection of the child, to keep the media from destroying their lives.",

Followed with keeping us afraid of \"terrorists\" while spending trillions on war to secure oil and enrich the defense corporations.
