Someone put a lot of a time into it.\n\nBut it wasn't just made recently. Decades ago, he saved up and saved up from his internships and had this beautiful walnut and gold plaque made. Every new job, it followed him.\n\nHe keeps it in a small, locked box in the bottom right drawer of his desk. Every day, at the end of the day, when everyone else has gone home, he opens the drawer, unlocks the box with the key on the chain around his neck -- fittingly, in the perfect shape of a cross, nobody would see the small ridges and valleys along one side of the crucifix unless they looked very closely -- and gently removes the plaque. He smiles, running his hand lovingly across the surface just once before polishing it clean with a soft cloth. He places it back in the box, closes the drawer and goes home for the night, still smiling.\n\nThis week has been different. Every morning, Michael pulls the plaque out from its box and places it into the hidden pocket on the inner breast of his suit -- a custom-made pocket, just for this purpose. All of his suits have one, of course. It rests snugly against his chest, close to his heart.\n\n*Soon,* he thinks. *This your time, Mikey. YOUR TIME!*",

Do the republicans think that covering up a blowjob was more of a risk to national security than a presidential administration possibly working in collusion with a foreign power?",

Too many GOP leaders are hellbent on defending Trump despite the damning evidence building up against him, leads me to believe that they themselves have some interest in killing the investigation other than just protecting Trump. If it were that simple, Trump would have been thrown under the bus by now to save the party's political capital. I suspect we're going to hear about Russia courting John McCain's presidential run at some point, and I do believe that McCain knows far more about what has been going on than he is letting on to, even with his tired, stroke-y contributions to the SIC.",

It suggests Republicans needed to be reassured that Reagan, considered an intellectual lightweight, could do the job. Any such concern is invisible in Trump's rating with Republicans, which started high and has slowly, slightly declined.",

    "body": "It's funny because I think Clinton kind of opened the door for Trump.  Just my thoughts and theory here, I'm sure a lot of people disagree with this. (shrug)\n\n\nPrior to Clinton there was always a quiet dignity to the oval office and specifically the presidency.  It could be said that JFK infringed upon this with his not so subtle affairs and the 'Happy Birthday Mr. President' incident, but that was all largely swept under the rug and forgiven with his assassination.\n\n\nBill Clinton was a different kind of president.  A candidate for president never appeared on an unserious late night show like Arsenio Hall until Bill Clinton played his saxophone.  He did this deliberately to differentiate himself from other candidates but it fundamentally changed how voters related to the president.  It went from more of a 'stuffy all business' relationship to a less formal one.\n\n\nAdd to it Bill Clinton's \"Hound Dog\" behavior and things that became public like blow jobs in the oval office - the previous respect and reverence for the office of the president was seriously injured.  George Bush was not 'presidential' enough to offset Clinton's damage to the office.\n\n\nObama restored much of the dignity to to office of the presidency, but I think was too polarizing a figure for all of America to get behind.\n\n\nThen enter Donald Trump.  Someone who would never have previously been considered a serious candidate because, let's face it - he's the least presidential president we've ever had.  He makes Bill Clinton look like a saint.  But I still maintain the reason a lot of the 'crazy right' even considered Trump was because in their view, after Clinton dignity of the office no longer mattered.\n\n\nAnd therein is part of the witch-hunt against Bill Clinton that was the impeachment.  Conservatives (especially social conservatives) were foaming at the mouth over how Bill Clinton had tarnished the office of the presidency and wanted blood.  He slipped up and lied under oath -  about a very personal subject but he didn't refuse to answer, he lied.  Republican's wanted to make the \"good ole' boy\" pay for wrecking the dignity of the oval office.  He didn't - so now they have their own much exaggerated version of an undignified president in office.\n\n\nBill Clinton opened the door, Donald Trump walked on through.  Had the precedence of an undignified president not been created (at least in the minds of the right) - someone as undignified as Donald Trump would not have been nominated to the republican party.",

Of course he's still a Republican, so there's that, but he's not running for re-election; this is the time when he should be cementing his legacy as a maverick respected by both parties (whether that reputation is deserved or not) and he's blowing it by making himself a Trump stooge which, honestly, doesn't benefit him in the slightest.\n\nTin foil hat time... Perhaps Boy Scout McCain is so disturbed because he himself has been complicit, maybe unknowingly at the time, but now that he realizes the depth of the corruption he's tied himself to he's doing everything in his power to bail himself out, and the stress of the looming consequences is literally causing his mind to deteriorate.\n\nI don't think I've seen anybody try to tie McCain to the Russia scandal with any hard evidence, but really, who better for the Kremlin to twist the screws on than the very last Republican that anybody would expect to be involved?",

If even one person had reservations on it, it would not have happened. The vote was conducted by private ballot, as well, to ensure nobody would feel intimidated on voting to pass this. Now, this was at RIT, in one of their Special Interest Houses (think kind of like a cross between a club and a fraternity, except without a national organization and based around a common interest.). School had a 4:1 male to female ratio while I was there. Not sure if it's gotten better since then or not, but whatever. Anyway, I'm a pretty tiny woman. And we managed to have these co-ed bathrooms without it ever once being a fucking problem in the least bit. Many mornings I'd walk in to take a shower, wearing only a towel, and one of the guys would be at the sink shaving or brushing his teeth or whatever. We'd nod or say hi to one another, then continue going about our business. The showers and toilets had private, lockable stalls.\n  \nIf a bunch of immature fucking nerdy-ass college students could handle co-ed bathrooms without it turning into a rape-fest, what the fuck is these assholes' excuse? And it's not like they're even going that far, anyway! I've got trans friends who are living as the gender they feel themselves to be, not as the one they were born as. They do not resemble people of their previous gender. Why should my FTM friend, a dude with a pretty rocking beard, be forced to use a women's bathroom? Or my MTF friend have to use a men's room? And for fuck's sake, they're not pedophiles, if they're using public bathrooms, it's to use the goddamn bathroom, not to peep at kids. These laws aren't going to stop creeps, it's solely about people having to recognize that people they don't like exist. Fucking assholes.",
