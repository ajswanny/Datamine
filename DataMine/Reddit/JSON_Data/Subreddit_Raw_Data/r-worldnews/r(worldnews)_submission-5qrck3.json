As horrible as this whole executive order is, for there to be no exemption for the people who have gone out of their way to help out our military is unconscionable.  You don't get to give grandiose speeches about how poorly our veterans are treated stateside, and then do this to fuck over the people that worked and bled with them.  Fuck this guy!",

The ones that want to come here love our country just as much as we do and don't take how great it is for granted. \n\nI think it's super important that we evaluate whether our petty differences and obscure, dubious objectives are worth adversely effecting the lives of people who want the same things we do in the end. Also, I wonder how many of those who support this course of action would feel about it if they were the ones at the customs checkpoint having to look in the face of the people who gave everything up for the American dream and tell them no. I'm not saying that there aren't plenty of people who think this is the right thing to do and would go about it without a second thought. I just get the feeling that there are many who don't understand the gravity or implications of this policy and won't because they think it does not directly effect them. It's sad that I get that impression,  but I guess it's the first world we live in. ",

In case there was any doubt about the latter provision\u2019s intent, Trump told Christian Broadcast News that it was intended to **give priority to \u201cChristians\u201d seeking asylum over \u201cMuslims.\u201d**\n\nEdit: People are having a hard time understanding that these countries are literally > 97%, and in some cases even > 99% Islam. So when you throw \"but there's atheists too\"...well I guess you got me. It's not banning Muslims from a country, it's banning 99% of it's citizens who happen to be Muslim, and Bob...the country's lone atheist.\n\nIt's also not about fighting terrorism, but preying on terrorist fears. Literally [zero Americans have been killed in terrorist attacks from these countries](http://i.imgur.com/izOO285.png) (I could bring up the Saudi Arabia conundrum here as well). Rather, this will instead give extremists something to point too as an example of the U.S. waging war against Islam.

I think a country like Iran getting exempted after 90 days is probable, while a country like Yemen could see an extension. \n\nEdit 2: ~~I want to point that if we like the executive order or not it is very likely not unconstitutional~~. The order discriminates against region, not by religion. You can read the full order here: http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/28/politics/text-of-trump-executive-order-nation-ban-refugees/index.html\nRemember no matter how you feel about this event, remember it come midterm. \n\nEdit 3: Just checking and Section 5 paragraph b actually *could* put this on the chopping block for constitutional infringement. What can be said in defense of Sec.5 Par(b) is if someone is being persecuted for a religion that they share with 75% (example) of the population, they are not as in danger. It also doesn't say that any religions are excluded. So a Trump administration could say \"we just want to help prioritize who is in the most danger and get those people out first, but continue to help everyone we can\". ",

So if you are not here yet, you're not getting here.  \n\nThis specific court action is a petition of habeas corpus for two specific immigrants being held, arguably illegally.  In layman's terms, this action affords them a hearing to determine whether their detention is lawful or not.  If it is not, they will be released.  The broader question is where they will be released, which this action does not specifically address.  \n\nAs far as I know, a habeas corpus does not supersede immigration policy.  So there is technically nothing stopping the federal govt. from releasing them from detention (if the judge orders it) and putting them on the next flight out of the country.  So I'm not sure what this accomplishes, aside from the cost of a one way plane ticket and a speedier process.\n\nIt does not apply to anyone else who is planning on traveling to the US (with or without a green card already obtained).  They are all still banned from entry.  And will now be stopped at their departure point rather than here at customs.  \n\nThe title of this post is absurdly misleading.  Trump's ban is still very much legal and in effect.  At least for the time being.  ",

Instead we have:\n\n* Republicans come up with the concept of the individual mandate in 1989 and propose it in 1993, later in the 1990s, and again in 2007.  Then they decide when Obama institutes it that it is unconstitutional all of a sudden\n* Republicans think Obama is stupid for not believing Russia is US enemy number one.  When Russia hacks the US to interfere with our election, all of a sudden they are A-OK.\n* Republicans want to invade Iraq because Saddam has \"WMDs\".  Assad uses chemical weapons on his own citizens in Syria and the Republicans refuse to give Obama authority to intervene with the military.\n* GWB, Rove et al use a secret RNC server to hide government communications, and then delete 22 million e-mails instead of turning them over.  E-mails relating to the early stages of the Iraq War as well as e-mails about the politically-motivated firing of US attorneys.  But it's fine!  Hillary Clinton has a private e-mail server - LOCK HER UP LOCK HER UP\n* Colin Powell uses private e-mail and recommends Hillary does as well. Hillary does so - LOCK HER UP\n* Scalia dies with almost a year left in Obama's term.  Republicans refuse to even *meet with* the centrist moderate Obama nominates.\n* Mitch McConnell asks that all of Obama's cabinet members go through full FBI background checks and ethics reviews before they are voted on, delaying Obama's appointments for weeks and months.  Great idea!  Democrats want Trump's cabinet of billionaire's with no government experience to be vetted - \"Democrats are being obstructionist\"\n* Obama and Congressional Dems propose infrastructure spending during the depths of the Great Recession.  \"Nope can't afford it!\"  Trump et al want infrastructure spending when the nation is near full employment?  \"Great idea!\"\n* Bush reaches the debt ceiling 17 times during his eight years? No big deal, Republicans raise the debt ceiling every single time.  Obama reaches the debt ceiling? Let's shut down the government and lecture everyone about government spending\n* Bush starts two wars, passes a massive tax cut, and passes Medicare Part D, with no offsetting tax increases or spending decreases?  Business as usual.  Democrats propose any bill at all?  Republicans now refuse to support it unless there are equal spending cuts\n* Obama is president?  The debt and deficit are all that matter.  Trump is president? GOP proposes a budget that will raise the debt by $10T over ten years.  \n* Hillary gives speeches to Goldman? She's in the pocket of bankers!  Trump puts five GS people at the upper echelons of his administration?  They're just the best people!\n* The Clinton Foundation, a charity, receives money from Saudi Arabia? She's in the pocket of the Saudis!  Trump refuses to put Saudi Arabia (or any Middle East nation he has business in) in his immigration ban, despite a long history of Saudi terrorism?  Nevermind!\n* Hillary Clinton runs a charitable foundation that pays her no salary while Secretary of State?  Unfit to be president.  Donald Trump runs a for-profit business while president?  He's a businessman!\n* Every presidential candidate releases their tax returns for transparency?  Good practice - Obama better show his college records and birth certificate too.  Trump refuses to show his tax returns?  \"Will of the people, the people don't care, blah blah blah\"\n* The Bush White House fires eight US attorneys for political reasons?  Just sweep it under the rug.  The IRS allegedly is politically-motivated in its investigation of conservative groups?  Burn it all down, huge conspiracy.\n* Online trolls make up a conspiracy about pizza and sex rings and Democrats?  Seems legit.  A well-known, respected ex-MI6 agent comes out with intel detailing possible collusion between Russia and Trump?  Sounds bullshit\n* Duplicate e-mails of Hillary Clinton's are found on a laptop days before an election?  Comey better break protocol and talk about a potential investigation before he even has a goddamn warrant.  Trump's campaign staff are being actively investigated for their ties to Russia, as in the FBI is asking for FISA warrants?  \"I can't mention anything, it would tarnish the electoral process\"\n* Kerry flip flops on the Iraq War, which the Bush administration actively lied about to get approval?  He's terrible!  Pence, Ryan et al flip flop on everything Trump is doing?  Not a whisper.\n\nCan you understand how one side would get tired of the hypocrisy?",

The most powerful members of congress are in districts that are \"safe\" - if they are doing things you don't like, by all means, vote them out. But in districts where the incumbent is doing the right thing, you want a person with political experience to challenge the more powerful people who are not. Congress is not easy to navigate and it is very hard for a new member to get into a position where they can make much difference. Simply throwing out old people and putting in new ones can actually have the opposite effect you are going for by solidifying the power of people who stay in.\n\nThe second part of your advice is good, and I agree with it. I'd add as well that it is very important to vote in primaries - lack of participation in primaries is one of the contributing factors to the increased polarization in our country, because to win, politicians need to appeal to more and more extreme factions in their respective parties. If you are not extreme, voting in the primaries can counteract that.",

All the Latinos doing the gritty nitty hardworking jobs packed their bags and NO ONE was left to fill the void. \n\nThen when many farmers (example) found people to work these jobs...they later found the Americans to be lazy, unreliable, disrespectful, and ended up having to fire them or they wouldn't show up, and quit. The policy ended up fucking them big time. I think they reversed the decision now. But it was a big deal down there.\n\nAny Alabama people back this up with personal relation/confirmation?\n\nEdit: This was called \"HB-56\" -- also I remember on a Vice documentary, they also tried having prisoners from jail come out and work these farms. Lasted about a week before the inmates just said fuck this, I dont wanna actually work hard!",
