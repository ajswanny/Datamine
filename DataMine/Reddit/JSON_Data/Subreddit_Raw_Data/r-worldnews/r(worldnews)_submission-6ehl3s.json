During the winter they got tons of publicity, including front-page reddit posts (shocker!), after they announced residents in blizzard-hit cities could sign up to [\"get plowed\"](http://www.bostonmagazine.com/news/blog/2017/03/13/pornhub-snow-plow-boston/) out for free by PornHub-branded trucks.\n\nWith all the pre-storm publicity, surely at least one person grabbed a photo of a PornHub-branded truck plowing people out? Nope. Perhaps a single person can verify they were the recipient of a free plowing? Nope. The entire thing appears to be staged, as thus far [there is no evidence it actually happened.](http://www.bostonmagazine.com/news/blog/2017/03/29/pornhub-plow-boston-hoax-fake/)\n\nAnd then there's the paid PR person who posts on reddit all the time, accused of doing scummy things like trying to buy PornHub ads on sex and masturbation-addiction subreddit.s ",

These girls answer ads on craigslist or other such sites, from guys who act like their boyfriends, sometimes. Who contract out work from bigger publishers. And there's just a giant cycle churn thing going on where it's a new girl every week. Usually he gets a space large enough for like 2-3 rooms of ladies so they'll cycle between like 4 or 5 at a time, making a bunch of videos to see if the publishers are interested.\n\nIt surprised me because the people I know in the sex industry make their own ads, get their own clients, set their own rules, worked with a local company if any and their services are publicly advertised in some way. That's why I've always been wildly in support of legalizing sex work. I wasn't aware just how much of parts of the sex industry had become flying teenagers to videographers with hard dicks in either Florida or California who can trick the vulnerable youngsters into staying with him for a few months while they make 1/10th the amount of cash they could make on their own. These ladies have dropped out of high school, put stress on their family life, Adults are allowed to do this, but they were swept up in the industry buzz, and probably the good sex too. And while sure, 18 year olds are allowed to fuck up their own life in this way, this wouldn't happen in such an irresponsible manner if the industry was regulated. If the environment in which they had to make these films was unionized newer ladies like this wouldn't be so easily taken advantage of.\n\nWe could do better, but we can't do anything if sex work is on the \"black market\". Nothing good happens in the black market.",

Here is a recent quote to explain:\n> \u201cIt is our corporate responsibility as part of the global tech community to promote ethical and responsible behavior. We firmly believe that parents are best placed to police their children\u2019s online activity using the plethora of tools already available in modern operating systems. The law has the potential to send a message to parents that they no longer need to monitor their children\u2019s online activity, so it is therefore essential that the Act is robustly enforced.\n\n>Despite the law, those seeking adult content can still circumvent age verification using simple proxy/VPN services. Consequently the intent of the legislation is to only protect children who stumble across adult content in an un-protected environment. There are over 4 million domains containing adult content, and unless sites are enforced against equally, stumbling across adult content will be no harder than at present. If the regulator pursues a \u201cproportionate\u201d approach we may only see the \u201cTop 50\u201d sites being effected \u2013 this is wholly unacceptable as the law will then be completely ineffective, and simply discriminate against compliant sites. We are therefore informing, and closely monitoring the development of the regulations, to be published later this year, to see if they achieve the intended goals of the Act.\u201d",
