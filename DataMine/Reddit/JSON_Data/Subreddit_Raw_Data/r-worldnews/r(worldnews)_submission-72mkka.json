    "body": "[Here is a NYT article with some more details](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/26/world/middleeast/saudi-arabia-women-drive.html?smid=tw-nytimes&smtyp=cur)\n\nSaudi Arabia announced on Tuesday that it would allow women to drive, ending a longstanding policy that has become a global symbol of the repression of women in the ultraconservative kingdom.\n\nThe change, which will take effect in June of next year, was announced on state television and in a simultaneous media event in Washington. The decision highlights the damage that the no-driving policy has done to the kingdom\u2019s international reputation and its hopes for a public relations benefit from the reform.\n\nSaudi Arabia, the birthplace of Islam, is a Muslim monarchy ruled according to Shariah law. Saudi officials and clerics have provided numerous explanations for the ban over the years.\n\nSome said that it was inappropriate in Saudi culture for women to drive, or that male drivers would not know how to handle women in cars next to them. Others argued that allowing women to drive would lead to promiscuity and the collapse of the Saudi family. One cleric claimed \u2014 with no evidence \u2014 that driving harmed women\u2019s ovaries.\n\nRights groups have long campaigned for the ban to be overturned, and some women have been arrested and jailed for defying the prohibition and taking the wheel.\n\nBut the momentum to change the policy has picked up in recent years with the rise of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, a 32-year-old son of the king who has laid out a far-reaching plan to overhaul the kingdom\u2019s economy and society.\n\nBeyond the effects it could have on Saudi Arabia\u2019s image abroad, letting women drive could help the Saudi economy.\n\nLow oil prices have limited the government jobs that many Saudis have long relied on, and the kingdom is trying to push more citizens, including women, into gainful employment. But some working Saudi women say hiring private drivers to get them to and from work eats up much of their pay, diminishing the incentive to work.\n\nIn recent years, many women have come to rely on ride-sharing apps like Uber and Careem to gain some freedom of movement.\n\nDespite the announcement, women will not be able to drive immediately. The kingdom has no infrastructure for women to learn to drive or to obtain drivers licenses. The police will need to be trained to interact with women in a way that they rarely do in a society where men and women who are not related rarely interact.\n\nBut many of the kingdom\u2019s professionals and young people will welcome the change, viewing it as a step to making life in the country a bit more like life elsewhere.",

I personally done like saudi arabia but i like the direction they\u2019re heading, not a lot of people understand this but saudi has been progressing (baby steps) these past two years all thanks to mohammed bin salman, i don\u2019t know what his situation is with Yemen but he\u2019s been doing wonders for saudi\u2019s progressives.

Women can only be examined by women (obvious in Saudi Arabia). Now just add a stipulation that all examiners must be born Saudi citizens and you've got a perfect Catch 22.

Siraj-ud-daula (Nawab of Bengal ) It was a test match with 2 innings. In first inning Siraj ud Daula gave a big lead but in the second \r\ninning British came very strongly and won the match. Outcome : Battle of Plassey established British as a strong power and it provided them a constant source of income from the richest state of India, Bengal.\n\nBattle of Buxar : It is basically an extension of Battle of Plassey. At the end of Battle of Plassey, Siraj was chased and later apparently killed by his own people and Mir Jafar was made a puppet Nawab. British East India company got loads of gift from the Nawab and a farman to carry on \r\ntax free trade. Despite Mir Jafar\u2019s gifts and rewards, British were not satisfied with him and replaced him by \r\nMir Qasim. Mir Qasim was an able administrator and tried to free himself from the clutches of the Englishmen. This behavior was disliked by the British and the conflict led to three battles.Mir Qasim was defeated and he fled to Awadh to take help of Nawab of Awadh, Shuja ud Daula. \r\nNawab of Bengal and Nawab of Awadh got into an alliance with the Mughal emperor Shah Alam \r\nII, who despite the deteriorating Mughal empire was perceived as the central authority of India.These combined forces met with British force at Buxar. Result : As expected, the combined army of the three was no match for the disciplined English \r\narmy which comprehensively won. Outcome : It was a morale booster for British and it established British as the super power.British got the Diwani of Bengal from the Mughal emperor. i.e. now they got the right of administration and taxation. This battle practically started the British rule in India.",

There is no such thing as \"secular and modernist factions\" in KSA, they simply don't exist, or if they do, it's the government that's already there, at least when compared to the alternative (ISIS). \n\nAlso bare in mind, there is a massive and global propaganda war taking place between Iran and KSA, so much of the narrative that KSA funds Wahhabism terrorism comes as a result of that propaganda war.
