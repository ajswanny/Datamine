    "body": "Cant people do math here? These accusations are ridiculous. The numbers don't add up. The \"millions of liters per day\" is actually only 1.08 million liters which is around 1000 cubic meters a day. That is ridiculously little when we are talking about factory. \n\nJust for an explanation, this amount of water would be able to irrigate maybe around 25 acre of field. Which is an area of around 300x300 meters.  Interestingly enough, since Chiapas area has rainfall of around 120 inches a year 25 acres is also an area that would cover yearly water needs of Coca-Cola plant. In other words the area of the factory will probably have more rainfall in water than it cosumes.   \n\nOr if you need a different metric, then look at [this list of rivers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_rivers_by_discharge) for water discharge per second. Even river number 139 has a discharge of over 2000 cubic meters per second. In fact even Usumacinta river that flows within Chiapas region as a flow of 900 cubic meters per second. So Coca-Cola plant needs would be satisfied by just one second of that discharge.\n\nOr another metric - an average per capita water consumption for household purposes is arond 100 galons a day. Which means that those 1000 cubic meters would be probably consumed by employees of the factory for their own household purposes.\n\nBut please do not let facts \"rain on the parade\" of mob hating on greedy evil corporations. I strongly doubt that Coca-Cola factory can be a sole reason for wells to go dry. Not unless the numbers in the article are off by several orders of magnitude.\n\nEDIT: I just googled that the city of San Crist\u00f3bal de las Casas which lies 3 miles from the Coca-Cola factory has a population of  around 186,000 as of 2010. Which means that water consumptions of that city alone will be two orders of magnitude larger that those mentioned in the article. Also I found this passage in wiki article for the city\n\n\"The natural vegetation of the area is a forest of pine and oak trees.[1] However, most of the surrounding hills have lost their native trees, with deforestation rates at 80%, losing 15,000 hectares just since 1980.[3][21] Reasons for this include cutting for firewood, urban development, poor resource management, fires and agriculture.[3][21] The deforestation has led to erosion problems blocking rivers and streams and affecting underground recharge of the area's freshwater springs\"\n\nMystery solved. But I guess it is easier for local politicians to blame the problems on greedy american corporation. Definitely easier solution then to convince local population to commit to responsible environmental management. Also forcing one of the local factories away will be great for municipal budget which will be then forced to face those problems down the road anyways. ",

The plant consumed over 1.08 million liters of water per day in 2016.\n\nThere's 2.5 million liters of water in an Olympic sized swimming pool. So, the bottling plant is using approximately 158 Olympic sized pools worth of water per year, which really isn't all that much. Or to put it another way, that's equivalent to the total water usage of about 2,900 Americans put together per year. If the wells are drying up, there's probably bigger factors at play here.",

His austerity plan cut wages by 50% and *diversos medios han hecho hincapi\u00e9 en su inexperiencia y en la poca atenci\u00f3n prestada a los problemas sociales en su estado*. (Many sources have drawn attention to his inexperience and lack of attention to the many social problems in his state.) He is accused of having spent *un escandaloso gasto publicitario de su imagen personal* a scandalous amount on personal publicity in the Mexican press, estimated at over 100 million pesos (over half a million dollars). He needs a public win, ideally socially-oriented and \"eco\".\n\nThe campaign to which this headline refers is intended to block the application for a renewal of the concession of Coca Cola. The water use issue is less important than the parallel health campaign, the main accusation of which is that CC sells their drink to campesinos at a 30% discount. This is alleged to make them fat, rot their teeth and in general damage el pueblo. ",

Coca-Cola does not bottle coke to ship all over the world, they produce a highly concentrated syrup that they then ship to restaurants and bottling plants that add water to serve their local market. So when a region in Mexico has a bottling plant that doesn't mean a corporation is stealing the water of some poor Mexicans to make coke, it means those Mexicans are buying so much coke that a local bottling plant was needed to meet their demand.",

Then there are states (like TX I believe) where it's a free for all. This results in the water going to whomever has the ability to get it.

    "body": "Comprehensive list of books detailing studies of real like anarchism, I have *** the most relevant:\n\n**James Scott** -- \n\n*** *The Art of Not Being Governed* is a study of upland southeast asian tribes who explicitly resist the state, \n\n*Two Cheers for Anarchism* is a cute polemical book written by a person whose whole life has been as a political anthropologist\n\nHe's a professor in the Poli Sci & Anthro departments at Yale and very well known for his work on peasant resistance, southeast asia & so on. \n\n**David Graeber** -- \n\n*** *Direct Action* is an ethnography of horizontalist movements in the global north & the dynamics of anarchism in every day action\n\n*Debt* is a history of debt, which dovetails with his anarchist work.\n\nMost of his other works--The Democracy Project, The Utopia of Rules, Toward an Anthropological Theory of Value, Revolutions in Reverse--and so on, mix both academic, anthropological research and his anarchist praxis.  Many of them are free.  All of them are good. He was at Yale, then went to Goldsmiths & is now at LSE, so he isn't some nobody. \n\n**Knapp, Ayboga, Flach**--\n\n*** *Revolution in Rojava* is a collection of pieces by and about the Kurdish revolutionary group the YPG & YPJ, based in the ideas of Bookchin & the Zapatistas, they are the main group fighting ISIS, in a feminist, demoratic, decentralized manner. \n\n**Hugh Thomas** - \n\n*The Spanish Civil War* is certainly NOT a pro-left wing book and the author is a british conservative, but it is the best history of the Spanish Civil War in terms of comprehensiveness.  And even he, Tory aside, has to admit the civil war was a successful social revolution & the West abandoned the Democratic Spain to the Fascists. \n\n**George Orwell** -- \n\n*Homage to Catalonia* is the reverse, as it is very pro-Spanish Republic, BUT it is by Orwell & is therefore a memoir, not a history.  \n\n**Pierre Clastres** -- \n\n*Society Against the State* initiated the anthropological project of documenting counter-state societies.  It focusses on Amazonia, and is quite dated, but fun nonetheless. \n\n**Peter Gelderloss** -- \n\n*** *Anarchy Works* is an analysis of a lot of previous works on the successes of anarchism, including many of the above.  Written by a committed activist, it is not an academic work, but it does cite & provide a way point into many of these studies. \n\n**Colin Ward** -- \n\n*Anarchy in Action* is a classic book on anarchism in every day life.  Again, dated, but fun. \n\n**Tom Malleson** -- \n\n*After Occupy* is not directly related but details the empirical research on the Occupy/Indignado/Reclaimers economic model, namely worker ownership, democratic control & horizontal living.  Suffice it to say, the evidence is in cooperatives favor, especially for smaller businesses, though for larger too. \n\n**Michael Schmidt** -- \n\n*Cartography of Revolutionary Anarchism* is an analysis of anarchism being developed outside of the world core.  The author has a dubious past, because as an investigative journalist writing about Nazis, he took his character a bit too far. That said, the history here is brief and good. \n\n**Craib & Maxwell** -- \n\n*** *No Gods, No Masters, No Peripheries* is a collection of essays about anarchism in the global south, in Africa, in Asia, in Latin America, in India & so on.  As far as getting a good scope of these discussions, this is a good source. \n\n\n**Peter Marshall** -- \n\n*Demanding the Impossible* is a classic history of anarchist ideas, primarily, but also practices.  He takes a very broad approach to anarchism, which allows for individualist anarchists, nihilists, primitivists & ancaps to be included in the definition, this is \"small a anarchism\"\n\n**Schmidt & Van Der Walt** -- \n\n*Black Flame*, by contrast, is a purist view of anarchism, viewing it as necessarily communist, but with insurrectionary & mass anarchism as two tactics, not two philosophies.  It is a counter to the above, but, involves the author with a dubious past. \n\n",

Gotta hand it to 'em though, they're experts at destroying the credibility of all leftists.\n\nMy dude Murray Bookchin on tankies (from his essay, [_Listen, Marxist!_](https://www.marxists.org/archive/bookchin/1969/listen-marxist.htm)):\n\n> When the hell are we finally going to create a movement that looks to the future instead of to the past? When will we begin to learn from what is being born instead of what is dying? \n\n> . . . the revolution of our own day can do nothing better than parody, in turn, the October Revolution of 1917 and the civil war of 1918-1920, with its \"class line,\" its Bolshevik Party, its \"proletarian dictatorship,\" its puritanical morality, and even its slogan, \"soviet power.\" The complete, all-sided revolution of our own day that can finally resolve the historic \"social question,\" born of scarcity, domination and hierarchy, follows the tradition of the partial, the incomplete, the one-sided revolutions of the past, which merely changed the form of the \"social question,\" replacing one system of domination and hierarchy by another. At a time when bourgeois society itself is in the process of disintegrating all the social classes that once gave it stability, we hear the hollow demands for a \"class line.\" At a time when all the political institutions of hierarchical society are entering a period of profound decay, we hear the hollow demands for a \"political party\" and a \"workers' state.\" At a time when hierarchy as such is being brought into question, we hear the hollow demands for \"cadres,\" \"vanguards\" and \"leaders.\" At a time when centralization and the state have been brought to the most explosive point of historical negativity, we hear the hollow demands for a \"centralized movement\" and a \"proletarian dictatorship.\"\n\n> This pursuit of security in the past, this attempt to find a haven in a fixed dogma and an organizational hierarchy as substitutes for creative thought and praxis is bitter evidence of how little many revolutionaries are capable of \"revolutionizing themselves and things,\" much less of revolutionizing society as a whole. The deep-rooted conservatism of the PLP[1*] \"revolutionaries\" is almost painfully evident; the authoritarian leader and hierarchy replace the patriarch and the school bureaucracy; the discipline of the Movement replaces the discipline of bourgeois society; the authoritarian code of political obedience replaces the state; the credo of \"proletarian morality\" replaces the mores of puritanism and the work ethic. The old substance of exploitative society reappears in new forms, draped in a red flag, decorated by portraits of Mao (or Castro or Che) and adorned with the little \"Red Book\" and other sacred litanies.\n",
