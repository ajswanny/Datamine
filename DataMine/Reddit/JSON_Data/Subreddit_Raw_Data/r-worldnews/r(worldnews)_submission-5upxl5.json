    "body": "Sorry but this isn't enough - **bigger questions** need to be addressed. Why do big companies behave as they do? WHY do they push for outsourcing, special visas, deregulation, etc? The answer is pretty obvious - share price and shareholders, and **the law** says put shareholders first.\n\nIt's often called \"shareholder pre-eminence\" and it's in the [Companies Act](https://books.google.com.au/books?id=jzWTCgAAQBAJ&pg=PT184&lpg=PT184&dq=shareholder+preeminence&source=bl&ots=Aqp0Z0kfPS&sig=W3TMC02G3QBCSKYkVoqkyoVmUak&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwih-qOezZjSAhVEV7wKHfWTDJQQ6AEIHDAC#v=onepage&q=shareholder%20preeminence&f=false). There has been an awareness of the [inherent](https://hbr.org/2009/07/shareholders-first-not-so-fast) [problems](https://books.google.com.au/books?id=-kVbli9u1KUC&lpg=PP1&pg=PP1#v=onepage&q&f=false) of this model for quite some time, but it is *so big, so entrenched* in how markets around the world operate, nobody knows how to change it.\n\nThe initial theory was that shareholding was good, because \"wisdom of the markets\" will prevail over companies behaving irresponsibly. This is a decent theory if you *assume shareholders are actually interested in the company*. But for a long time, they have not been, because *shares themselves* are traded for *profit* - which means if a company wants capital investment from shareholders, they have to ensure their share price **keeps going up**. And **that** is one of the major causes of these problems.\n\nWhere is the logic in asking CEOs to \"step up\", when their board will simply vote them out if they don't do what is best for the almighty share price? CEOs can lose their jobs if they \"step up\", so why should they?\n\nSo companies are forced to behave in exactly the way we did not want them to, basically because shareholders aren't \"invested\" - personally - in companies any more. Shareholders just want their share to go up so they can trade them and make a profit. This is profit motive gone too far - and it's **the law** that this is the case. If leaders like Trudeau want companies to change their behaviour, they all need to get together and **change the rules** so that shareholders once again become invested in the actual reason a company exists, not just because it makes for a good share trade.\n\n(ed: This is kind of how crowd-funding works - you buy \"a share\" of the project, so it gains capital to kick off, then you get something back for it, and everyone's happy. You don't go and *trade your investment* when the project becomes popular, **because the price of a share never changes**. However, if that does come about, mark my words; a \"crowd-funding share market\" will emerge and will incentivise the same behaviours in crowd-funded projects we're blaming CEOs and companies for now.)\n\nSo there has been no \"wisdom of the market\" for a long time now, due mainly to the \"industrialising\" of share trading - which was [once restricted](http://www.tradingacademy.com/resources/financial-education-center/history-of-trading.aspx) to small, individual players, but is now an industrialised enterprise in itself, which has basically turned the market \"neurotic\" and hangs like a sword of Damocles over CEOs and corporate behaviour - keep increasing profits aka share price, or capital investment (and your board) will go find someone else who will.",

To quote the American humorist Kin Hubbard, 'It ain\u2019t no disgrace to be poor, but it might as well be.' It is in fact a crime for an American to be poor, even though America is a nation of poor. Every other nation has folk traditions of men who were poor but extremely wise and virtuous, and therefore more estimable than anyone with power and gold. No such tales are told by the American poor. They mock themselves and glorify their betters. The meanest eating or drinking establishment, owned by a man who is himself poor, is very likely to have a sign on its wall asking this cruel question: 'if you\u2019re so smart, why ain\u2019t you rich?' There will also be an American flag no larger than a child\u2019s hand \u2013 glued to a lollipop stick and flying from the cash register.\n\nAmericans, like human beings everywhere, believe many things that are obviously untrue. Their most destructive untruth is that it is very easy for any American to make money. They will not acknowledge how in fact hard money is to come by, and, therefore, those who have no money blame and blame and blame themselves. This inward blame has been a treasure for the rich and powerful, who have had to do less for their poor, publicly and privately, than any other ruling class since, say Napoleonic times. Many novelties have come from America. The most startling of these, a thing without precedent, is a mass of undignified poor. They do not love one another because they do not love themselves.\u201d\n\n-Kurt Vonnegut, Slaughterhouse 5\n\nJust thought I'd leave this here...\n\nedit: First reddit gold woot, and I didn't even have to work for it!",

There was a much less adversarial relationship between employers and employees because rationing, round the clock shift work, and the draft applied to everybody. \n\n(b) Most of the men returning from the war were just really happy to be alive and we tend to underestimate the impact of that on their professional lives. He described his thought process as something like: \"Too bad Jim got that promotion instead of me, but fuck it, I'm not dead in France.\" He noticed his veteran colleagues tending to get along really well with each other and management because of that attitude. \n\nWith that in mind, he noticed a real change with the boomers (my parents generation) as they came of age. He felt that lack of shared sacrifice and appreciation for life contributed to the culture of runaway corporate greed he saw in the 1980's. \n\nI'm hopeful that my generation (the millenials) will help swing the pendulum back closer to the experience of my grandfather, due in part to our shared hardship in the ridiculously fucked up crushing student loan/unpaid internship/short-term contract oriented economy. \n\nSpeaking personally, I know that if I started a business I would lean towards a lot of decisions that would benefit my employees because I would want to do the opposite of what I've experienced so far.

Originally I was just going to denounce these stingy fucks, but then I did some research.\n\n\nAccording to the St. Louis Fed: https://www.stlouisfed.org/Publications/Regional-Economist/January-2013/Why-Are-Corporations-Holding-So-Much-Cash\n\nThe interesting thing about that article and other research, is that firms that engage in more R&D hold onto more cash.  Also interesting to note, repatriation taxes are **not** responsible for significant corporate cash holding in the US.\n\nI though maybe lax patent law in China would show that R&D's relation to cash holding was a result of over-reaching value formed by patent monopolies in the west.  But when I searched for that, I found that Chinese firms also increase cash holdings when they're more R&D focused: http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.688.3576&rep=rep1&type=pdf\n\n\nSo I'm sorry to say there's no good answer.  R&D is risky but a successful moonshot can grow profits exponentially.  But in order to make a moonshot, you need the cash to pay for it.  Hence, R&D firms are holding too much cash and more firms are focused on R&D these days.\n\nThe best I can say is that the financial sector is failing here.  If it was easier to finance R&D investments, there would be less incentive to hoard cash.  There's no corporate bond equivalent to Y-Combinator for large firms, and that's a shame.",

They rely on government aid to make ends meet (food, housing, etc). This allows Walmart to post high profits while keeping prices low. \n\nOn the other hand, if Americans chose to say that full time work should cover the basics, then we would have a different situation.  There is more nuance to this too, by the government subsidizing Wal-Mart like this, it also allows many people access to that store because it is so cheap. Essentially we'd have to have a major cultural shift to value human life more than corporate profit, and at the same time, be prepared to walk away from Walmart if they look to price gouge their customers because we cut then off the government dole.

People don't understand that high literacy, education, accessible and affordable healthcare, living wages, community...it all adds up to the societal bottom line.  It's rough to get there but if you want to build a knowledge economy (which we need to, it's the future - resources are a finite means of economic prosperity) we as a country need to commit to fostering policies that get there.  Living wages is central to this. A huge middle class (or rather a generally prosperous class) gives children the best opportunities to grow to their potentials.\n\nThe government needs to rethink resource economics as a stop gap to building a long term economy.  Oil will go away at some point.\n\nAgriculture needs innovation. Technology is where things are headed and I don't just mean computer programming.  We need biologists and physicists.  We need workers who voice ideas and learn to implement them.

It looks like the working rich who drove the upsurge in income concentration in the 1980s and 1990s are either retiring to live off their capital income or passing their fortunes onto heirs.\nhttp://equitablegrowth.org/research-analysis/economic-growth-in-the-united-states-a-tale-of-two-countries/\n>the share of incomes going to the top 1 percent surged from 10.7 percent in 1980 to 20.2 percent in 2014.7\u00a0As shown in Figure 2, these two income groups basically switched their income shares, with about 8 points of national income transferred from the bottom 50 percent to the top 1 percent. The gains made by the 1 percent would be large enough to fully compensate for the loss of the bottom 50 percent, a group 50 times larger.",

(They take the money for granted due to inexperience in the workforce and the difficulties of finding good work with good pay)\n\n2. They get bored over time of the same job, leading to apathy.

Ultra-low-latency microwave (not optical fibre!) Links are used to fight for the lowest possibly latency. Why? They do this because if you can refresh the current state of the market before someone else, you can cheat the stock market. Companies make billions off of creating these microsecond shorts and surges, relying on obviously unfair nanosecond advantages in speed. This is what is meant in that HFT can have nothing whatsoever to do with the fundamentals of a company. This trading has absolutely nothing to do with the assets or quality of a company. All that is required is activity in the market, no real investment is ever made. To me, this is lunacy and I don't understand why stock exchanges haven't been universally changed to a \"tick-based\" system, where everyone views the same information for 50ms or even 1-5 second intervals. These microsecond transactions are completely against the spirit and intent of the stock market in my opinion. I don't really see the advantage of allowing up-to-the-micro-second updates - this will only ever benefit the biggest cheaters, the ones who have paid billions to create ultra low latency connections into stock exchanges.\n\nIf anyone knows more about this, feel free to jump in.

I'd take out trash. I'd be right beside them doing the \"shit work\". I understand not every job has such demonstrable \"shit work\" but if you have people under you slaving and working hard, it would behoove you to not even give the appearance that you're fucking off or not working just as hard. \n\nAlso, verbal affirmation goes a long way. Thank your people after every day. \"Thank you for your hard work today\" to everyone means a lot. There are more rewards than just monetary ones, feeling like their effort is seen and appreciated goes a long way towards people's job satisfaction.\n\nThe other chefs never got why my line bent the fuck over backwards for me. I told them it's simple, I treated my line like a bunch of human beings and worked my ass off as much as I asked them to work theirs, and then thanked them sincerely for what they did. \n\nEdit to add: You will have to delegate. Do so based on logic, not emotion. Sure, forcing the lazy asshole on my line that I couldn't wait to fire to wash dishes may have felt like sweet revenge but not having enough dishes when we needed them would have made everyone suffer. My most talented line cook was the one I always had go do dishes if I couldn't, and I told her up front why: she's incredibly talented and efficient, so her absence forces everyone else to perform at their best, and because she was the only one I trusted to make sure we got the right clean dishes when we needed them, she was who I sent. She went on to graduate from Johnson and Wales and got a job as a sous chef at a michelin starred restaurant in NYC and frankly, she's a better natural cook than I could ever hope to be even well trained. It's been years since I switched careers into finance and I got an email from her last year telling me about her advancement and how her early start helped prepare her for the hardships of culinary school, internship, etc. \n\nBut this translates to every profession-- when you have to delegate out the shit work, don't do so punitively and don't do it without extra praise, etc. ",

    "body": "What America lacks is education and an interest in politics. Seriously. People don't turn out for local elections, so the mayor is often some idiot that knew some people around town. For presidential elections, the turnout is greater, but it still sucks overall and many groups don't turnout well. African Americans came out and voted for Obama and they did not to that extent for Hillary Clinton or Trump.\n\nIt's a bit complicated, for many reasons, why the US has ended up in the situation it's in. Anyone can say they're a journalist now and be heard, so what is spread is what is popular and interesting, not what is factual. Journalists are not held to a standard any longer and the truth no longer matters like it once did because newspapers are not the primary source of information these days. People want to be entertained and so they'll turn to the form of media that coincides with their own personal beliefs that is entertaining to them.\n\nRepublicans and democrats believe they want different things, but they don't. The average republican and the average democrat don't want tax money squandered, they want good paying jobs, and they want to feel safe and be safe. In fact, I believe most people would agree that tax loopholes should be cut, welfare programs reformed to prevent waste/abuse, etc. They believe they want different things now because politicians tell them the opposite party is going to take things away from them.\n\nQuality of life in the US is getting worse and worse. CEOs are making more and more whereas the wage disparity keeps climbing. Competition is heavily restricted and that's leading to outrageous costs for healthcare, internet, phones, and much else plus the quality of what they receive is poor.",

And with my brief dip into those worlds, I made sure I did well in school, got a scholarship and went on to make my own business. And in my business, everyone got profit shares. Cook, office staff, everyone contributed to making the company a success. \n\nWhen we got bought out I was given a $250,000 bonus and I turned it down and gave it to my employees, split even based on 1 human, 1 part of the bonus. Enjoy. \n\nI did that because I saw unions and I saw exploitation. To my company a programmer is worth more than a chef so the programmer has to be paid more or else I can't retain him. But I didn't have to give the chef bonuses and profit shares (bonus is based on how YOU did, the profit share is based on how the COMPANY did) and before we got bought out I issued stock in the company to everyone. \n\nSo the cook cashed out with $120k and so did the secretary. \n\nMy body took a beating in the factories and my feet still hurt from it. All my life they will. I had shit jobs. But I am glad I was there.\n\nEvery old timer kept saying, finish your education, get a degree, you will have an open world to do something else. \n\nThe unions though did make sure those guys got good pay and got a 10 minute break every hour. The plants were always productive. No problems with management and employees and everyone tried to work as much as possible. Grab an extra shift meant you could make time and a half or double time. If the plant is doing well then this means a lot of workers are getting double hours, then on the extra hours you're making double rate so it's tripling your salary. \n\nUnion protected them into that.\n\nMy company didn't need a union because there was no need. We were small enough that it was a family and I saw both the good and bad sides of huge corps and how employees were treated. \n\nNow a lot of companies will not want unionization but they give an environment that you want to work in.\n\nWhen Unions started my grandfather was an \"agitator\" and Ford Motor Corp. send thugs around to break up the meetings. With baseball bats. So you had to be looking over your shoulder or those guys might kill you. You would show up to work and maybe you didn't work that day because they say your job is not there. Or you need to bribe the foreman to work.\n\nAnd the machines, fuck, the stamping machines in an auto factory need multiple people and they all press two buttons each. These are just so that your hands are known to be away from the press when it hits. So you don't get a hand in there. A loose hand means the press cannot operate. Smart.\n\nThe companies would not give a shit if you lost a hand before unions, they'd find someone to fill your place. Unions forced them to accept safety standards and you could feel better about not coming home with one less hand and now never have your life fucked up forever. And with worker's comp you could now be paid for that kind of horrific injury to help you.\n\nAll from unions. \n\nIf you get rid of all unions, who knows what we go back to. \n\nThe people who want rid of unions though are the corps. They remember the golden days.\n\nBut *you* don't.\n\n ",

The estimates for the cost seem to go up every time I hear them from Trump, and as anyone that deals with contracting knows, the cost will be even more than the final estimate. Also there are maintenance costs. It won't be reaching $100B upon construction, sure, but it is a very expensive wall, and will almost certainly cost more then the stated $22B.\n\nAs for being chump change, 22B$ is 0.5% of the annual budget, or 1/200th the annual budget. That is **NOT** chump change! I know T and B are different numbers, but *trillion* and *billion* are not as different as you are making them out to be. That is more than NASA's budget. That is more than we federally spend on Food and Agriculture. That is a third what we spend federally on Education, and a third what we spend on Veteran's Benefits. That is FIFTY times what is spend on public broadcasting, and ONE-HUNDRED AND FIFTY times what was spent on the National Endowment for the Arts.

    "body": "It's arbitrary naming of a generation.  \"Generation X\", \"Baby Boomers\", etc.  We're \"Millennials\" because we're a generation born around the turn of the millennia.  That's the current major event of our lives, the first digit of the year changed from a 1 to a 2 near the earlier part of our life.\n\nWhy the broad strokes though?  Generalisations are easy.  Everyone in my city is a terrible driver.  Like, 30 over the limit (in a 50km/h zone sometimes!), turning right from a left turn lane, swerving across two lanes around someone you were behind and cutting them off to make a left turn 1 second faster, etc.  It's figurative though, not *everyone* is a bad driver.  If I got a dime for each person I could report for a traffic infraction though, I wouldn't have to work anymore.\n\nAs to why \"Millennials don't believe in anything\" is a valid stroke is because we're a better educated generation (in spite of remarks to the contrary).  A lot of us have seen our parents complaining about something unfair and working hard but getting nowhere while we grew up, and we know better than them.  We're also taught about some magical time when governments were out to help (or at least, govern) the average person and did a decent job of it all through our schooling.  The US more so than Canada I believe, like the founding fathers are amazing people or something for founding a great nation (a debate for another thread).  But then we see all the things our governments *aren't* doing by contrast, and it's easy to lose faith in the system.  A time when the government stood up for the common person and made ground breaking advancements in rules governing new systems?  Madness!  Neither of our governments have come up with a proposal for genetic experimentation or proper rules governing the internet.  Not that they could, the internet is a global thing and would require *every* nation to agree on a set of rules, which is about as likely as counting all of the sand on all of the beaches in the world.\n\nRather than the previous generations saying, \"If I work hard enough, I'll be rich some day\", I hear more millennials saying things like, \"if only people would listen to me\" or \"if only I had the power to change stuff\".  I, personally, think I'd do a better job than most politicians who only seem to be in office to get paid.  I hold no delusions that I'll actually be prime minister some day and finally weed out political corruption, but it's a thing I'd love to happen.  And I feel a lot of millennials are in the same boat.  They'd like to make change happen for the better, but they all know that as long as the previous generations are in charge, nothing will ever change.  Justin Trudeau is popular in part because he straddles that generation line between the older generations who \"remember the day\" and the new generation where everything is twice as expensive and information is global.  It's promising because he's kind of a herald for coming days where the old farts will disperse and people actually relevant to our current world will be brought in and be left to do what they think is best, rather than listening to the advice of a now antiquated way of life.",

But for heavens sake, don't form an opinion until you've talked to both parties and weighed the evidence!\n\nHave your supervisors' backs: you hired them for a reason. But if you hear complaints, check it out immediately.  Nobody's perfect. Trust the people you hire to do their job, but hold them accountable if they screw up or goof off. That shows so much respect, and it should hopefully garner their respect as well. If you are clear on your expectations and how you will respond, life is soooooo much simpler.\n\nAlso, if you screw up, admit fault and take the blame. Acknowledge it immediately: if you're this ready to accept responsibility for something you did, they cannot point at your behaviour to excuse themselves.\n\nI've been treated very poorly in past jobs; this comes from experience as an entry-level underling as well as a tenured supervisor.

His popularity was so great that it was dubbed 'Trudeaumania.' Look at [this picture](https://i.cbc.ca/1.2250567.1382679447!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/220-trudeau-greycup-cp1970.jpg) of him straight up pimpin',  or [this one](http://i.imgur.com/X2PfgVq.jpg) for more shenanigans. \n\nWhen he heard Richard Nixon had referred to him as an asshole, he famously replied 'I've been called worse things by better people.' \n\nWhen asked how far he would go to stop the violence of a Quebecois seperatist group responsible for kidnapping a British trade consul, and the Quebec Minister of Labour (who was later found dead in the trunk of a car), he infamously replied [\"Just watch me.\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeTsQQ22Uwc&ab_channel=MattTrecartin)\n\nJohn Lennon called him 'a beautiful person,' and went on to say \"if all politicians were like Pierre Trudeau, there would be world peace.\" Fidel Castro attended his funeral. Justin Trudeau's election in 2015 was the first time the child of a prime minister has been elected to that office. \n\nFor other notable recent Prime ministers, Jean Chretien once put a protester in a choke-hold,  coining the phrase ['Shawinigan Handshake.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shawinigan_Handshake), and comes in 5th for time in office at just over 10 years. Edit bonus: [Narduwar vs. Chretien](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWf2LLaHkM0&ab_channel=NardwuarServiette)\n\nStephen Harper comes in 6th at 9 years, 271 days, was the first PM from Western Canada who lasted more than 5 months, and spent most of that time leading a minority government due to the Left vote being split between the Liberals, New Democratic Party, Bloc Quebecois, and the Green party who finally managed to win a single seat in parliament in 2011. Parliamentary democracy with first past the post has its problems. In the 2015 election, Bloc Quebecois received 821,144 votes, and the Green Party got 602,944 votes. In parliament this translates to 10 seats for the Bloc, and 1 for Green, because the Bloc had enough localized support to win ridings. One of Justin's election promises was voting reform, though he has since abandoned this promise, to the disappointment of many. \n\nKim Campbell is notable for being our first and only female Prime Minister. Though she was in office for less than 5 months (in 1993), it adds to the list of things we've been ahead of the US on, along with legal gay marriage (2005), and nation-wide legalization of Marijuana, the legislation for which should be introduced this spring, and is an election promise Justin cannot afford to back off on. \n\nIf you read this wall of text, hopefully you learned a little about Canadian politics. Things can get interesting and heated inside the Parliamentary Igloo.\n\nEdit: Kim Campbell is from BC, thanks /u/VanhamCanuckspurs, though I choose to consider Western Canada as everything from Manitoba, across the endless plains, through the oil-sands, to the Rockies, and not that pretty, magical Hippie-land they got a bit further west. On another note, is anyone else occasionally surprised when they remember that we have a territory called Yukon? \n\nEdit2: Thanks very much for the gold, added a link for 'Just watch me,' because it's a lot better in context.

And we'd be much less religious.\n\nWith a young population base, we could re-fund and re-tool social security.

Then it'd be interesting to see what happens as that group ages out. \n\nAbortion, contraception, family planning, sex education... lower std rates, fewer unwanted pregnancies. \n\nTaking the populations of all the big cities means we get the economic output but also will deal with the crime plaguing urban areas. With higher taxes and education funding potentially no longer linked to local property taxes, we could see if that actually turns things around. \n\nWe would take most if not all of the billionaires who have committed to donating at least half their wealth before or upon their deaths.

However, *some* unions in the US have deviated from those basic principles.\n\nFor instance, the US has MANY public sector unions, like police unions and teachers unions.  These unions do not push for shares of profits (because there are no profits) but instead simply serve to shore up political power for the benefit of public servants, often at the expense of the public.  Police and teacher's unions use their power to remove accountability for police and teachers.\n\nEven with some unions of for-profit employees, their aims spread beyond the boundaries of their mission, sometimes even putting the companies they work for out of business.  In other examples, unions zealously defending their members create extremely unfair and unequal treatment of workers.  For instance, many auto unions in the US agreed to have new employees make only $13/hr in order to preserve $60/hr salaries for existing employees.  ",

It put him in a whole new light for me. I was less likely to attack him even though my beliefs were very different.",

    "body": "There was a time in humanity's life where we worked 4 hours a day harvesting, hunting, or building tools.  The rest of the day was ours to do with what we pleased.  We started trading things to others because we wanted things others had, which prompted us to make more of the things we had to trade away and still have some of that thing (like shoes.  People like shoes).  We invented money in various forms so we didn't have to carry around cartloads of stuff to barter for other stuff.  Imagine trading a budget computer and two sets of clothing for a week's worth of groceries and a luxury dinner tonight.\n\nMy belief though is when we get replicator technology (or at least, when things can be made without human involvement on demand), the need for money will fall by the wayside.  We'll instead return to the idea of just working out of necessity to fuel survival.  Farmers farm because they like farming, not because it's profitable.  Programmers (the good ones) program because they like solving problems through software.  There will always be people who will do a thing because they like doing that thing.  I'd be an educator if it didn't mean having shit pay, obscene hours, a convoluted schooling track, and no job security.  We'll definitely have people interested in piloting and fixing mining robots.  And I hear about engineers the world over who are excited about their jobs in power management (and thoroughly disappointed by the bureaucracy hampering their work).  So there's plenty of evidence (admittedly anecdotal) that if money wasn't a thing, we'd still get by.  Without the need for money to survive, we'll set our focus on improving our lives more directly and on a more broad and global scale, rather than selfishly wondering whether you'll be earning enough to make rent this month.  It might even see the creation of a global government in that far flung future that's genuinely interested in assisting *everyone* on the planet, rather than just the people in one arbitrary region some people centuries beforehand drew up on a map and claimed was independent of the other places.",

If I recall correctly, the Liberals said they wanted IRV, and they could have put it through without a referendum from my understanding. However, since the NDP and Greens wanted PR or STV, and the (bullshit) mydemocracy.ca survey showed that the people wanted a more PR system, he decided to abandon it instead of push through his own preference against the opposition's wishes. The other option was a referendum, but imo now is not the time for a referendum. The Conservative race, refugees, Quebec City shootings, and the Trump rhetoric has increased devisiveness in our country right now, and with the failure of the Brexit referendum, plus the allegations of foreign hackers and fake news artists influencing elections around the globe, I don't think it's a good time to have a referendum. That's just my opinion though, and I completely understand that people are rightly pissed about his decision. Hell, even I'm pissed that he didn't at least put ranked voting as a temporary measure, since it's a simple upgrade in every way to the current system.",

    "body": "We have a GST of 5% on most goods that keeps the coffers filled enough. We still pay a decent amount of tax too, 35% or so. I think it comes down to the core values that matter. What are doing with that money? When a good portion isn't going to military you can spend it on the people. So we had no major complaints really. Like many Canadians I thought it was wrong that so many cuts were made to Veteran's Affairs, Trudeau put everything back in place, reopened the offices. It's important to take care of those that have gotten injured for their country. Weirdly Harper had more militaristic leanings so that is why he flag was symbolic. Plus we had a 150th Anniversary to prepare for. He made me nervous as he was not open, it made me wonder what is he hiding? Plus I want my own Member of Parliament to be able to speak freely for the people they represent, Harper had them all on lock down. The press were only allowed one question total at the Hill a day. They would get together to try and figure out what it would be and it might not get answered. As an open society, the press should have free reign to ask any and all questions. We are actually the ones in charge, we want to be informed. I want to trust my leader even if I don't like what he says. \n\nAs far as disdain, I bet it was because we looked at Obama as a good leader and all we heard was criticisms of him. We could not get why someone (who quite frankly IS a good person) trying to do the right things for his country would be so harshly spoken of. I guess we are a sad that he didn't get to accomplish everything he wanted to, which would have made a better society for you. Canadian Conservatives are more like middle of the road in your politics. So most conservative people here would seem somewhat liberal in their leanings to you. As an example gay marriage was passed many years ago and hasn't harmed our society one bit. Obama was quite Canadian in his thought process. Much like Trudeau really. When we talk about our politics here it isn't with hatred of the person, more like dislike of certain decisions they have made. I have noticed that if we like a decision our government has made we will cheer it on despite our party leanings. We don't mean to sound immodest, instead we just feel blessed. We are lucky. I feel like our government really cares about all of us as people and recognizes the awesome responsibility they have to and for us. ",
