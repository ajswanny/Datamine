    "body": "I was once a FedEx delivery driver, so I don't know how it is for Amazon, but I would imagine it's similar? \n\nAt FedEx we got paid per package delivered, which means the faster you deliver your packages, the more you are technically getting paid per hour. In addition to this, you'd get a daily bonus for delivering the packages fast. We could take our lunches whenever, nobody cared as long as the packages got delivered. However, very few people ever stopped to eat their lunch. Most people would eat and drive. If there was a bathroom on your route, that's cool, but otherwise you are peeing in a bottle because you aren't trying to waste time searching for a bathroom when you could potentially deliver 4 or 5 packages in that time. All of this holds especially true at this time of the year, when guys are getting ran 6 days a week, with 200+ packages per day, and with the sun going down an hour earlier (night time delivering slows you way the fuck down). \n\nWell what happens when you deliver so slow that you're making less than minimum wage? I don't know about Amazon, but at FedEx if you were so slow that you made less than minimum wage with your per package deliveries, you were simply paid minimum wage for that day's work. \n\nAnyways, there are a lot of shitty jobs to have during the Christmas season but, in my opinion, this is the worst one of them all. The pay isn't bad if you have your route down; but goddamn you can't even enjoy the damn holidays because you're always on \"go\" mode. \n\nEdit: As someone pointed out, this applies to FedEx home delivery and not FedEx Ground. FedEx ground gets paid salary and has benefits, and often has a partner too.\n\nEdit2: So sorry, also worth noting that FedEx Express is a completely different story because unlike Ground and Home Delivery, these guys are actually working directly for FedEx.\n\nEdit3: Upon reading the comments, this is not the *worst* job to have in the holidays. It's pretty bad though.",

That's just a little under two items per minute. So, if you had an unlucky path that your scanner gun sent to you on, you could be going from Isle one to Isle 200 over and over. And they would not adjust for travel time.  You still have to pick 100 items per hour.  At the very end of my stay there, they lowered it to 80 items per hour.  Definitely easier to achieve, but barely.\n\nOh, and to avoid being fired for low numbers, I constantly ran.  I didn't speed walk.  I flat out ran.

They said, \"Sorry, we aren't hiring anyone part time, only full time.\"  She said, \"No, thanks,\" and left and went home.\n\nA week later Amazon called and complained that she was a week into her training and hadn't still shown up, and if she didn't show up soon, she would be fired.  She explained that she wasn't actually working for them because she only wanted to work part-time, like the jobs they'd advertised when she'd applied but which hadn't actually had. They said, \"No, no, you can work for us part time, just show up before we fire you, because you haven't shown up for training all week.\"\n\nSo, she showed up to work.  Both she and her supervisor spent the entire first day getting her added to the payroll system, which it turned out was especially difficult to do because according to the Amazon computer she'd already been working for them for a week, albeit a week during which she'd been entirely absent.\n\nShe ended up developing a bad back in only few months of working for them, basically because she was a weak little girl and had never been capable of doing the heavy lifting the job they hired her for required in the first place.  The working conditions were abysmal, too. So, she ended up quitting, with proper notice, because she still had her old day care job available, which paid less, but was much more pleasant than doing heavy lifting all day with a bad back.\n\nAfter she left, Amazon kept calling her for months, complaining the she still wasn't showing up for work.",

    "body": "As someone who worked in one of these distribution facilities in the US, perhaps I can shed some light on how this system works for the US with Amazon drivers. Firstly, the drivers operate their own vehicles and use their smartphones as the technology to scan and load packages into their vehicles (read: packages are assigned to drivers and checked by someone like me before leaving). Then depending on the distance between locations and number of packages, the route was either a 2, 3, 3.5, or 4 hr route. All of these routes paid minimum $18/hr with it sometimes going up to $22/hr on bad weather days or when not enough drivers showed up for the given time (routes are added to this available list that is visible on peoples' phone apps and they choose to accept routes). This higher pay accounted for fuel/car expenses (which is the idea), but drivers choose to accept these routes. The conditions and expectations for success was competitive, but there were many drivers who had near perfect delivery success rates who finished almost all of their routes in under 75% of the estimated time, even with a 65 pkg, 4 hr route. It seems to be a little different with these uk drivers having to rent a van, but in the US, this model works better as the average car is significantly larger. Amazon's business model is efficiency, so if they cut corners where traditional businesses don't, it shouldn't be a surprise, but they should be held accountable if they are forcing bad conditions on their drivers. In the US I don't think this is the case from what I saw. This also helps with the 'peeing in a bottle' issue. Because drivers accept the routes they want, it's on them to take a break to eat/ go to the restroom by not accepting back to back slots. Or just finish early and use that time. The drivers who had a system of organizing packages and looking over there route were probably taking home $150-$180 a day with time to eat and use restrooms. ",

I\u2019ve called Amazon multiple times to complain about their drivers and have told them they should leave package delivery to the professionals (UPS, USPS, FedEx). They just aren\u2019t good at doing this themselves.\n\nI\u2019ve seen or heard about the following with Amazon\u2019s drivers:\n\n* Leaving packages at the main trance to an apartment complex, on the sidewalk, outside of the leasing office, for anyone to take.\n\n* Leaving packages inside an apartment complex in a common walkway no where close to the intended apartment. A neighbor was kind enough to walk that one over to me.\n\n* Delivering a package after hours to a business and leaving it in a gazebo used by smokers in the company\u2019s parking lot. It sat there all night. An employee was honest enough to bring it to the mailroom the next morning.\n\n* Same building as above, package left sitting on the ground outside the doors to the building.\n\n* Same building as above, package thrown inside the door as someone was leaving (card key access, so the delivery person has to buzz the mailroom, but that takes a minute or two, so they don\u2019t like doing it).\n\n* Same building as above, driver complaining on her cell phone that she\u2019s sick and tired of having to deliver to companies where she has to buzz the mailrooms, loud enough for everyone standing around smoking to hear her.\n\n* Package logged as \u201cattempted delivery\u201d when no delivery attempt had been made. I assume this was because the driver simply didn\u2019t feel like delivering the package that day.\n\nWhenever I see \u201cAMZN\u201d as part of the tracking ID on a package I order from Amazon, I *expect* problems. It\u2019s that bad.\n\nHaving read this article, I can see that the drivers are under a great deal of stress, and are underpaid, and I can understand their attitude a little better now. Amazon needs to get its act together. I do most of my shopping there, and I don\u2019t want to buy from a company that treats employees\u2014contractors or not\u2014this way. It\u2019s bad for business, it\u2019s bad for the customer, and it\u2019s just plain disgusting.

When we call customers at apartments or when we can't find houses, we are expected to say \"this is me, calling from Amazon blah blah blah\", although we are not considered Amazon employees.\n\nAmazon also does not provide us with any reflective vests or branding stating we are Amazon employees or work for Amazon, and this causes lots of issues this time of year since it gets dark at 5pm and a random unmarked car is stopping in front of houses and going to the doors. I have been chased by dogs, given looks by homeowners and their neighbors, I have been followed by homeowners cars as I made all my stops in a neighborhood, I have had the police called on me, you name it....\n\nAlso, when packages are stolen from customers doors, or customers lie and say they did not receive a package, we are marked off, and fired after 5 packages are reported not delivered. On top of this, we are expected to complete our route even if it takes much longer than the time we were paid for. Flex drivers are unable t9 provide any proof to get  these hits against them removed, it is always the same computerized response \"we have taken your response into consideration, but our hit against you still stands. We are also marked off if we do not delivery all the packages from the route and decide to go return the remaining packages to the warehouse at the end of our paid time.\n\nOver all, a 4 hour shift has about 80-100 packages, and we are **not** paid by the package. Amazon is paying us $18/hour as contractors, meaning they are paying us $72 for 4 hours, and they are paying under $1/package if you look at it that way.\n\nWe have to use our own car, own gas, and are not paid anything per mile by Amazon.\n\nThe shifts usually range around 100-140 miles from beginning to end here in the Midwest. The warehouse employees treat us like garbage and file reports against us if we do not follow \"Amazon rules\" to get us terminated, although we are not \"Amazon employees\".\n\nOn top of that, Amazon embarrass by sending emails saying \"since it is the holidays, we will pick 10 winners across the US every week to win an Amazon dot for those that work\". Seriously? You have over 10,000 Flex employees across the US, and you're going to give 10 of them an Amazon dot weekly in the month of December, instead of paying more. Wow! Such incentive to work!

The senior QA supervisors all had gout after the years of being on the floor it took to get up to that level.  Making it worse, they had the attitude of \"well i went through it and so should you\" so they keep passing on the disease inducing expectation instead of teaming up and informing the boss of this ongoing problem.

The blocks are first come first serve and it is very competitive in terms of getting them- you also get a offer for \"reserve blocks\" via email and can accept or decline.\n\n4) Depending on volume of packages you may get a little (like 1 package for 3 hours) or a lot (like 80 for 3 hours). This is the busy season so yes people are going to get a lot of packages, but there are a lot of blocks available and a lot of drivers, there have been slow times where the location ran out of delivery and I was paid $54 for showing up.\n\nFlex drivers make more than the fulltime white van contractors, generally I can complete a 3 hour block in an hour and a half, its all about organizing your packages and being efficient.\n\nI read the article and feel bad for the UK drivers-that dosent happen at my location, if the white van contractors dont finish the route, they take the packages back and it is re assigned to a flex driver. \n\nFeel free to ask questions.",

Amazon wanted to push more packages to them, but FedEx as a company did not want Amazon to be more than a certain % of all total packages (then they're reliant on Amazon, who can negotiate pricing etc....)\n\nSeems more like the best interests of UPS/FedEx to limit Amazon's percentages, had led Amazon to rely on 3rd parties and increase their own logistics infrastructure (purchasing Whole Foods). I know they've had issues using USPS for their \"Amazon Fresh\" deliveries. \n",

I never saw it and it was never clear when or where the steaming happened. I do know that it definitely didn't happen between Pakistan and the bag the pickers'd pull.\n\nSo then things go in a bin on a shelf. Out of style? Collecting dust. Eventually ordered? Into the tote they go, down to packing. No gloves. No dusting. Probably sneezed and coughed on countless times, in addition to falling on the floor. Again. Moreso if you're ordering from a smaller retailer with fewer fancy robots to go up to higher levels to grab stuff.\n\nThen packing doesn't wear gloves, and when the courier takes it, you've got _this_ to deal with.

Trump says the same shit and they all get away with it.\n\nI've repeatedly had companies throughout my life tell me they can't properly refund me for damages they caused but the moment I even miss a minor payment on something out comes the collections agency.

    "body": "I was an Amazon delivery guy for 6 months and it was horrible. The company I worked for wasn't Amazon, it was a contractor. Amazon paid the contractor per package delivered, and we were paid a fixed amount by finishing a route that day. You started the day with an \"amazon phone\" and a route with somewhere between 160-200 packages. The problem was that these routes ALWAYS took longer than the \"expected time\". So if you finished your route in the time they say you should, you would technically be paid a little more than minimum wage. The problem is that various things would happen on each route that would cause you to take HOURS longer than expected. They essentially assumed each package involved you walking out of your van with the package ready to go, walk a few feet to a doorstep, and set the package down. And there are a million reasons why that's completely absurd. Common things that extended your time were people not being home and you having to call the customer, or not being able to locate the apartment/house, not having access to an apartment building, or even just rain or snow. Most days we would start at the warehouse at 6:45am and not arrive to the warehouse till 7 or 8pm. And I'm not a slacker, I RAN my routes the entire time. Didn't eat lunch. Strained my bladder waiting till I had a package at a building where I could use the restroom. I did every trick I knew while following all of Amazon's guidelines and it just couldn't be done in the time they expected. It was impossible. And what is there excuse when we told them their routes were too hard? \"GO faster!\", \"Call the customer while walking to the door!\", and my favorite, \"Have your truck organized so that you have the package right when your get to the stop!\".\n\nWhat really makes me hate that last bit of advice is the fact that we were timed in the morning as we loaded our trucks. We were supposed to pull in all our trucks in this cramped warehouse and take 20 minutes to load our trucks with all the bins full of packages on our sheets. That never happened. Again, Amazon asking us to do the impossible while they shout at us to hurry up and GO GO GO! Moving large racks around, past each other, picking up over a hundred pound bins of packages and shoving them in my truck that I have to bend over to stand in almost destroyed my back, and actually did ruin my friends back who had to quit because of it. Good thing we get those health care benefits...Oh right, we don't because we are \"contractors\".\n\nThey treated us like dogs. Most of the people there were from the ghetto and were black and I guarantee there was some racist bullshit going on. I only met the owner of the company once and it was when he was essentially forced to come and talk to us after they lowered our wages, told us our checks were lower \"because of a glitch\", and then told us, \"Oh no we just lowered your wages and didn't tell you\". THATS FUCKING ILLEGAL. The owner came in and was the sketchiest guy in the world. He sounded like a greasy snake-oil salesman. I told him it would be nice to have an email or some way to contact our boss besides text, so that if the sorters are backed up you could tell all the workers to come in a little later. He tells me he doesn't like email because it \"causes barriers\". NO, you just don't want a paper trail of all the ridiculous crap you put your workers through.\n\nThat place was getting worse and worse before I left. They were paying less money per route than when I started, while at the same time package amounts were INCREASING. There were other contractor companies there that completely fell apart because too many people would quit and they would have no one to cover the routes. It's absolutely ridiculous what Amazon's contractors do to there workers and it should be illegal if it isn't already.",

I worked there for 5 years and they call it The Golden Handcuffs because once you're there for a little while it's very hard to leave. \n\nPay and benefits aren't everything. They work you HARD. REALLY REALLY HARD. It's a very physical job. You're either loading or unloading semi trailers full of boxes or all sizes and weights, loading or unloading ups trucks full of packages of all sizes and weights, doing international shipping stuff (idk what they do, never was down in that part), sorting packages as they pass by you very fast on a belt and pulling them off to chuck into your trailer or truck. OR, your sorry ass had my job which was smalls. \n\nI was in a group of 3 that sorted, scanned and bagged small envelopes and packages to 60+ locations around the state and another 20 or so to the rest of the country. How many zip codes can you memorize and how fast can you work? My job was relatively cushy because it was more mental than physical until we got a \"special\" which was extra.volume from one of our customers. Our DNR shipped through our facility along with the state Bar organization and at least 1 insurance company.  So hunting/fishing updates, yearly and quarterly insurance/lawyery shit...fml man. \n\nIt's such a stressful job. Unless you're lucky and have a great building manager, you only get feedback when you're doing something wrong. You're never moving fast enough to have good numbers (unless smalls got an early special and called us in early to work on it, which was fine with me) and it's hard physical labor. And the hours suck, too. Morning shift is like 5-9am, evening shift is 5-9pm. Ish. Warehouse have no heat, no ac, no fans. Our location was next to a swamp which was great for mosquitos. \n\nI loved my union but I hated ups and I hated the work. Took me 2 weeks to unwind after I left and a few years to shake the \"my day ends at 5pm\" thing because I was so used to needing to get everything done by then so I could go to work. ",

    "body": "I'm in the US, but it's the same way here. One \"4 hour\" route is typically 50-100 miles, so you use a lot of gas. Also, 4 hours is only the time Amazon claims it should take. If you still have packages to deliver after 4 hours, you have to deliver them anyway or you get fired. They don't pay extra when this happens.\n\nFor example, on Friday I worked two 4 hour blocks. The first one actually took 4 hours, but the second one took 7 hours because of traffic, delays at the warehouse, the route being horribly organized, and them giving me far too many packages. I worked 11 hours, only got paid for 8, and also have the expenses of driving 200 miles. That whole time I was speeding 10-15 over the limit, because if I don't, I get fired. I didn't have a bathroom break the whole day, and I didn't eat anything the whole day. Subtracting gas, I effectively made 10.18 an hour, and that's before expenses like insurance and maintenance, and this kind of frequent stop driving is very rough on vehicles.\n\nAmazon doesn't account for things like huge apartment complexes that don't have vehicle access near the actual buildings. That day I walked/ran 8.5 miles, most of it running to save time. There's a hard cutoff for completing the route, and if you have more than a few packages that don't make it, or even just one or two packages on multiple days, you get fired. I only had 8 minutes to spare before the cutoff.\n\nIf I had a single package after the cutoff, I would have been fired because of a previous incident, that wasn't my fault, that messed up my ratings. A few weeks ago I had a drunk customer threaten to assault me, and when I called in to report it, they said to return the rest of my route because making an incident report would take a while. They said it wouldn't count against my ratings. They lied, and they did count those undelivered package against my ratings, they refuse to correct it.\n\nAmazon doesn't give us handcarts, and even if they did, they fill our vehicles to the absolute maximum with packages so there so there isn't room for handcarts anyway. I'm still sore from carrying countless 40 pound boxes into apartment buildings that don't have elevators and don't have vehicle access anywhere near the actual apartments.\n\nAmazon knows what they're doing, and they don't care.",
