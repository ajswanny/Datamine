I remember watching the Sound of Music and the [Baroness wore one](https://princesspincurls.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/max-baroness-schraeder-car-scene-bow-tie-sound-of-music-von-trapp2.png) at one point in the movie. I imagine that it would be hard to wear one now without having the religious stigma attached to it. ",

In Iraq after the invasion, religious backwards clergy took over the power and started forcing men and women to be overly conservative. Women were forced to put on hijab and create a doctrine similar to that of Iran and Saudi Arabia. Men were tortured and killed if caught wearing shorts, it was received with a huge backlash but because of the lack of law and order and fear women started to just loosely put a scarf on and they would take it off when reached schools or work. It was perceived as influential power moved by the regimes from the two religious fanatic countries surrounding Iraq and no one was happy about it since it was started to be forced on our Christian population as well. Lots of girls I went to college with had to hide their crosses and put on the scarf and then take it off the minute they are inside campus and the same goes to Muslim girls. It actually created a juxtaposition because girls started to wear more liberating clothes underneath that the administration had to bring the uniform back since the university turned into a runway lol. Things are much much better now than 05-07 and many girls are wearing pants and form fitting clothes but they couldn't get rid of hijab and it's scary because it started to become the norm just like how Iran is.

    "body": "Ok actually he is confusing burka with niqab which is also a foreign concept. The difference between the two that niqab is a separate headpiece with the mask (think of Aladdin harem but a thicker black ninja-like piece, trying to paint a picture for the west here) but lots of people refer to that as niqab and I even myself was talking about that tbh. I have never seen an actual woman wearing the burka not even in Saudi Arabia, I only seen them on tv for afghani women during Alqaida era). Niqab is a modernized streamlined version of burka since its consists of the head piece attached to a mask piece and an abaya which is a cape-like garment that put on the head and just flow down just like how you would be doing when you wrap yourself in a blanket on a cold movie night. Men actually also wear abaya but instead of draping it from the head you instead draping it from the shoulders. If you notice, Arab and Muslims are actually equally modest since men wear a head piece and multi-layered dress (think Lawrence of Arabia garb). All stems from protection of the sun and air-born dirt and it goes back to the old days of Moses and Jesus frankly. It's a cultural thing more than religious. Europe just updated the whole thing by wearing wigs and coat then moving to hats while the Middle East kept it light and preserved the tradition. ",

There was a good article I read about a women's only squat in Spain that made the step to keep men out most of the time because they felt men just couldn't fully embrace accepting their equality and often they experienced the talking over phenomenon when they had group discussions about their needs and so on.\n\nThey of course still have monthly meet ups with men I believe, invite them over so its not some radical lesbian feminist thing. It just sometimes turns out men are insensitive to what women actually experience and reading a lot of comments here... I think they're right.

Public places are... public. They belong to society. To us, the people. Then why should i feel like i can hide my true intentions and body language while enjoying the fruits of this public location? Especially considering the fact im making the job impossible for the people we, as society, put in charge to safeguard said locations (police officers).\n\nWhen im walking in a city centre i shouldnt only think what my rights are when confronting hundres of others individuals. I should also consider what their rights are when hundreds of individuals encounter me.\n\nWe shouldnt want a society where even in public places people demand \"personal space\" before the well being of the public as a whole.",

Faces are how recognize and differentiate identies- if you take as a reasonable assumption that religious text is written by men thousands of years ago the. It's worthy of investigating why someone would be motivated to create these rules and enforce them through the power of religion. The only motivation that seems plausible to me is that it keeps women from acting as individuals, they're identity and expression and desires is subverted by these customs. In modern western societies our government has claimed authority that used to be held by families and religion- sometimes these legacy power-structures conflict with secular norms and the state and people who's wellbeing it represents wins. America and Europe would never tolerate honor killings for instance. We don't let men beat their wives. These are behaviors you could justify with religious texts. As a society we've collectively determined your individual right to practice religion doesn't trump the health and safety of others. That's a positive thing in my view. And protecting the basic human-experiences that come from face to face interaction is no different. ",
