    "body": "I work in Emergency Management. I Have some insight into what's going on here. I'm not \"victim blaming\" or blindly support Trump here but, this is a problem with both Puerto Rico, and Federal law.\n\nAn \"Incident\" (blanket term for both Natural and, Man-made disasters) is managed at the lowest possible level. So, If this was a disaster in your county, your county government would manage it, and ask your state government for help. Your state would then ask FEMA for help if it needed additional resources and funding. This is how the Law deams it to work and, how it usually works out best.\n\nIt's part of the changes that came about after Katrina. It used to be that once the state asked for help, FEMA took a bigger leadership role. The main problem with that model is, FEMA personnel from other parts of the country are clueless about your community. They don't know what resources you have, their capabilities or, have working relationships with them. FEMA personnel also face a huge learning curve when dealing with the makeup of the the residents and the potential dangers of the local industries. \n\nIt's the local cops, firefighters and emergency managers that know the critical needs of their communities and it's why that shift in leadership was made.\n\nhttp://www.cnn.com/2017/10/16/health/puerto-rico-hospital-ship/index.html\n\n>According to the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the official protocol is for patients in need to go to their nearest medical facility. If that facility is unable to provide care, a doctor there should contact the medical coordinating center in San Juan.\n\n>Someone there will then determine whether a patient needs to be transferred to a hospital on the island and which one. In some cases, a determination will be made to transfer a patient to the US Army Combat Support Hospital in Humacao, which has 44 beds and has been operational since Sunday. The remaining option is for patients to be transferred to the Comfort.\n\n>\"Only patients with critical needs requiring specialized care will be transferred to USNS Comfort,\" said Coast Guard Lt. David Connor in an email. He is working at the FEMA Joint Information Center in San Juan. \n\n>\"The disconnect or the apparent disconnect was in the communications flow,\" Rossell\u00f3 said.\n\n>He acknowledged that the system must get better.\n\n>\"I asked for a complete revision of that so that we can now start sending more patients over there,\" Rossell\u00f3 said.\n\nPuerto Rico, just as every other state and territory of the U.S., is required to have an Emergency Management agency or, task an existing agency (Dept. of Health, State Police equivalent, etc...) with the authority and the responsability, to plan for and be able to function in a disaster such as this. It looks like PR's government is failing it's people as much as the Feds are.\n\n**TL;DR: The U.S. response could has been quicker, Americans are suffering but, Puerto Rico's government has dropped the ball it this case and, it's illegal for FEMA to come in and take over.**\n\nEdit: Thanks for the Gold!\n\nEdit 2: Wow guys, Thanks for the Gildings and great response to my comment.

    "body": "Thought about it and I'm going to bring some facts and educated some people about PR and politics. PR is largely composed of 3 main political parties. At their cores what separates these parties is their beliefs in what PR's status should be. You have the PPD that wants PR to continued being a common wealth (BTW, the UN classifies PR as a [colony.](https://nacla.org/article/puerto-rico-united-nations)  )Then you have the PIP who want PR to become independent, they only have about 5% or so of the votes. Then you have the PNP who want PR to become a state. Now historically the PNP has aligned itself with the Republican party and the PPD with the Democratic party, but this is not exclusive. There are leaders of the PNP who have registered as Democrats and leaders of the PPD who have registered as Republican. Now the former governor who tweeted the pic is from the PPD and a Democrat. The tweet was not done to get more help but as a political maneuver. The current governor is from the PNP party and praised Trump for his support and leadership several times. The PPD is dying a slow death, the mayor from San Juan that everyone loves is from the PPD and likely will run next election for governor. All this is posture, it doesn't help anyone get actual help. The ex Governor whom is in part responsible for the infrastructure power grid problem that PR faced before the hurricane is being a tool. He's trying to show how he too is critical of Trump and tie Trump to the current governor. BTW, Ricardo Rosello is the current governor of PR and will win the re-election in a landslide the man has been relentless in the process of restoring PR. \n\nBut here are more facts, two years ago PR went through a major power outage through the entire island cause the power grid sucks. The ex-Governor held a press conference to announce that the problem had been resolved, power goes out in that conference. Then you add the fact that a major hurricane unlike anything PR had seen in a century destroys all the electric poles and add that PR is an island, well that's a recipe for being without power for a while. Based on the people that I have talked to FEMA, Coast Guards, Army and everyone else the federal government has sent have done an excellent job. The response unlike the news will tell you was quick and yes, Trump can take credit in that part, like it or not. But the problem is enormous and is not as simple as just flipping a light switch. Far from it, airport was destroyed too, roads were destroyed and so were ports. Is a massive uphill battle for recovery. So, if you are up voting this article cause, \"Fuck Trump\" then put your money where mouth is and donated to unitedforpuertorico.com if not shut up cause you don't care about PR except to be a political ploy to bash Trump.\n\nEDIT: I wanted to add that the ex-governor who made that tweet was so unpopular that he didn't even run for re-election cause he knew he would be trounced. And no, it wasn't cause he wanted to spend more time with his family or anything else, this was a career politician that was hated cause he sucked at his job and still being a tool.",

This included time in PR.\n\nProbably the single greatest impression I took away of government in Latin America was its systemic corruption and inefficiency.  Every bureaucrat at every level wants their cut.\n\nIt's agonizing to witness when you see how the citizenry suffer as a result of it.  It's been this way since the Spanish left and I doubt it's changed that much in the 20 years since I lived and worked there.\n\nAlthough I despise Trump and detest everything he represents, the fact is PR (outside of San Juan) was - at best - a Second World country before the hurricane hit.  It looks like it's been knocked back a century or two.  \n\nTrump's baggage and history of bigotry make him the last person someone like me would listen to, but what he says about the limits of working in PR are true.

The \"local government\" whoever it is, cops fire, whatever, they contact FEMA and they say: \"We can't do anything because we can't use the roads, we can't contact our staff, the people don't have water or power and they can't travel on the roads. We need you FEMA to coordinate bringing water to all the people.\"\n\nManagement of emergency response requires people to actually do something, so if the individual people can't do it, then someone else has to do it. That's the responsibility of the federal government. If PR is failing to handle the response, that's why we have a federal government. Trump needed to say: \"The government of PR can't do their jobs because the situation is to severe, I'm sending in the National Guard to take over the management of the response.\"",

Today in particular the power didn't go out once. the current generators are meant to keep most of the essential equipment turned on but they don't have the power to fully stabilize the whole grid long term .  outages in that hospital were pretty rare and at it's worse were hours longs instead of daily like it's been this month. i think people here are giving the wrong impression by implying that the current situation in that hospital is the norm there when it very much isn't. it's a specific issue with the grid that gives power to the hospital and many other high consuming areas in the capital. other hospitals with power have not been dealing with this issue\n\nI don't think trump's response has been a ten like he said a few days ago (far from it, especially when you leave the metropolitan area) but as much as many of media critical of him wants it to be he didn't create the crappy electrical grid in PR. People have been working hard to get it working but yeah some areas were pretty badly hit and a lot of it will have to be rebuilt from scratch.\n\nif you have any more questions i'm happy to answer :)",

First, the question itself was bait as the reporter specifically asked him to grade the response from scale of 1 to 10. There's really no right way to answer that and he should have just deflected the question but even if he gave it a 7 or 8, that would generate headlines like \"Trump not trying his best on PR rescue efforts.\" Also, the answer was in context of the whole rescue effort and the rescuers doing their best despite enormous challenges so the answer of 10 isn't so ridiculous.

Flooding is a primary failure mode for underground lines  \n2. Puerto Rico is a small island surround by sea and thus more susceptible to storm surge, tidal waves and (unlikely) tsunamis\n3. Puerto Rico is directly in the path of one of the busiest cyclone (hurricane) highways in the world\n4. Even when not inundated with yearly torrential downpours in the form of tropical depressions, tropical storms, hurricanes, and regular ol' thunderstorms, Puerto Rico (again, as a small island sitting in the great big ocean) has a higher than average water table",

Puerto Rico not only got federal funds, but also enjoyed a tax exemption that incentivized plenty of companies to move there.\n\nIn fact, many of those companies are still operating over there even after then tax incentive was phased out.  But the local government never came up with a development plan to take advantage of the help they were getting.  \n\nBack in the 80s and early 90s when light manufacturing started closing plants and moving to the Dominican Republic or Central America all the local government thought of asking was protection from the Feds, which never came.\n\nTourism was another wasted opportunity; back when Puerto Rico was competitive I did a paper on the local tourism market and find out that about half the tourists were Puerto Rican from the mainland staying with relatives.  The island couldn\u2019t compete on price with the other island in the Caribbean, but it could develop a strategy to attract high end tourism.  They didn\u2019t, and now you see high end tourist going to Punta Cana in the D.R.\n\nThe last good shot they had was the development of the southern city of Ponce as a logistical hub for the Caribbean; that would taken advantage of Puerto Rico location in the Caribbean (what made it a target of English and Dutch attacks during the colonial period).  But infighting between the governor and the mayor of Ponce led to the project cancellation.\n\nGuess what happened? The Caucedo terminal in the Dominican Republic now has that market.  By the way, I and hundred of thousands like me finally threw the towel and moved to the mainland.\n\nDon\u2019t blame the Feds... they did their part, but the local government didn\u2019t.",

He just seemed to bumble from one thing to the next, and his bumbling hit a high point during the Iran Hostage crisis.  The Iranians specifically wanted to stick it to Carter because he gave the Shah asylum.  Now the Shah had cancer, so in Carter's mind he was just being a good humanitarian, but the Iranians didn't take it that way, since they had just overthrown the Shah.  Carter's \"high mindedness\" created an international incident that lasted 444 days.  The Shah meant absolutely nothing to us.  We could *easily* have just said \"Hey, dude, cancer sucks and all, but push off.  Try Canada.\"  Carter's handling of stagflation was a disaster as well.  Mortgages were at like 15% APR -- crazy.\n\nNow Reagan was no angel by any stretch of the imagination, but he *projected* competence, especially in his first term, and he surrounded himself with people who were pretty competent in their spheres.  The contrast was stark.  He had most of Carter's \"do gooder\" attitude, but he backed it up with action.

In short, it's only fair that Puerto Rico fall behind the 50 states in terms of federal aid priority due to the limited taxes they pay.

The declaration allocated federal funds to aid the affected citizens.[11] The state Department of Education decided to close all schools on Kaua\u02bbi indefinitely.[10]\n\n>>The thousands of residents without power celebrated Thanksgiving by cooking turkeys on outdoor grills or smokers. Army and Air Force planes delivered 20,000 Thanksgiving rations to the thousands left in temporary shelters. The United States military also airlifted generators to Kaua\u02bbi due to several days of power outages.[13] By three weeks after the hurricane, utility crews restored power to nearly all major areas in O\u02bbahu, while 5,000 remained without power in Kaua\u02bbi.[10] By around a month after the hurricane passed the island, utilities were restored to most of the entire island. All roads and highways were cleared, as well.[9] One 25th Infantry Division soldier at Schofield Barracks died while cleaning up after the hurricane.[1] Two people died in a traffic accident due to malfunctioning traffic lights.[14] Following the storm, significant redevelopment occurred in Poipu, where the hurricane flooded areas several hundred feet inland.",

    "body": "Considering I live in PR - I'll give you an answer. I'd say ... not really .. -ish. Although Trump hasn't handled PR well, she's not being honest about what's going on in PR. There are a lot of supplies at the ports in San Juan, so it's not an issue about FEMA not bringing supplies, it's distribution. FEMA is supposed to help local officials in the event of a disaster, not run the show. The fact that PR was so ill prepared, in terms of coordination, for a hurricane is not Trump's nor FEMA's fault - that is entirely PR's problem. This is the result of a lot of political fighting in PR over the last 30 years. Nothing ever gets done in PR. \n\n\nSo no, she's not being sincere. She knows there is a lot supplies stuck at the ports, she knows the the USS Comfort is at San Juan - they just can't even coordinate a list of patients to transfer to the damn ship and half the damn ship is empty. None of the is Trump's fault, or FEMA's fault or what have you. That is all a lack of local officials of developing a plan.\n\nFEMA is dealing with 3 hurricanes across 4 or 5 states and territories, plus Cali and Oregon fires and the Mexico quake. FEMA hasn't been hit this hard in forever. They are stretched thin. Combine that with the fact that PR is completely disorganized politically, and you get human suffering, which is definitely happening on the island. \n\nNow, the mayor wants to run for governor in 2020 - so part of what she does and says is political calculus. She knows that for the situation to improve drastically in the short term, governor Rosello would have to ask FEMA to assume control of the relief effort, instead of him being in charge. Since Rosello knows the mayor wants to challenge him, he doesn't want to look weak, because he knows she will attack him with regards to how he managed the crisis come 2020. If he gives FEMA control, she gets to call him unqualified to be governor. \n\nShe is somewhat playing to her base - which is generally young college students and pro-independence and status-quo supporters when she makes waves in the media. In all honesty, she should be more critical of the local officials who never bothered to establish a plan and make the necessary investments to ensure that the capital had communication with the islands mayors and emergency response officials. They were incommunicado for a week after the hurricane hit. \n\nThis is also the mayor, btw, who said she didn't need the federal government meddling in the island just a few years ago. \n\n\nThe situation on the ground is harsh, especially in the center of the island. But there is A LOT of local blame.",

If he gives FEMA control, she gets to call him unqualified to be governor.\n\nDoesn't make sense to me, it seems like damned if you do, damned if you dont. If I was her I'd attack him either way. If he gives up control, II say he is unfit to lead. If he retains control, I just say \"Remember how bad it was?FEMA couldve helped but Rosello didn't let them,because he wanted the credit for the recovery. Well? Credit him with prolonging your suffering just so he could look good. He is vain and unfit to lead.\"\n\nRosello should just do what's best for the people.",
