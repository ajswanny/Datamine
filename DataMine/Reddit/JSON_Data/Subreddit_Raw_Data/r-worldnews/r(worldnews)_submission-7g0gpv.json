Here in Minnesota there is place called the north west angle which is not connect to the mainland of the United States at all, you have to either take a boat across a lake or go through Canada. But when driving from the north west angle into Canada and back into the United States there are no police or border patrol to stop you. You need to get out of your vehicle, and enter a small phone booth where you basically ring Canada and say \u201ceh I\u2019m coming through okay?\u201d And they\u2019ll say \u201coh okie dokie enjoy your 45 minute stay\u201d. I\u2019ll try to link a video about it if I can find it.\n\nEdit: [here\u2019s the video](https://youtu.be/SkbuZfC06d8) \n\nEdit 2: lol the video I linked is blocked... in Canada. I apologize to my friends in the north! But a nice fellow posted a mirror with that you can watch below!",

Also now that more than a few states have legalised it as well its not as big a deal as it would have been a few years ago.  Canada wanted to do this about 15 years ago but our big brother down south threatened us with all kinds of shit so we never went through with it. Its ironic that some states down there did it first after bullying us not to do it a few years ago.",

Weed has been descriminalized for over 10 years. Under 30 grams and the police will let you walk on a solo offence. This legislation is taxation at work and as a Canuck I am grateful as I have benefitted from things like free health care, safe roads, and snow plows that work harder than anyone I know.

Sure, conservatism wins out to be the most popular form of government in some regions (i.e. the middle east), but progressivism has been slowly advancing since the beginning of time and taking the world with it.

    "body": "The main issue with politics in North America is that the parties\u2019 values are misaligned with their economic policies.\n\nConservatism of culture, tradition, values, and religion is waaaay easier under socialized circumstances. Conversely, pure capitalism drives rampant change in lifestyles, jobs, demographics, culture, etc.\n\nTrue \u201cconservative\u201d people will never be happy under \u201cright wing\u201d economics. \n\nAs I understand it, Japan\u2019s \u201cright wing\u201d party provides a lot of \u201csocialized\u201d support to farmers that use traditional agricultural practices, etc. As far as globalization, comparative advantages, and opportunity costs are concerned, Japan definitely shouldn\u2019t use so much of its limited land on agriculture, right? Yet why do things like Kobe beef and many other \u201cbest in class because they\u2019re made in Japan\u201d type foods and produce exist? Wouldn\u2019t modernized techniques or outright importing food make more sense? It\u2019s because to CONSERVE their tradition and culture, the country uses tax dollars to keep the old ways viable instead of letting free market forces drive rampant change and erase their preexisting culture.\n\nMeanwhile \u201cconservatives\u201d in North America support letting the free market forces ravage their existing lifestyle. It\u2019s mind-boggling that this makes sense to so many people. Capitalism forces them small local stores and businesses to close down in favour of the likes of Walmarts and McDonalds. Good service and hospitality are disappearing and being replaced by call centers in India. Manufacturing jobs are going to China. Even local jobs, low paying AND respectable are going to hungry immigrants. All because of market forces in raw capitalism. All because at some point the republican party pulled hoods over the true conservatives and have been leading them to the slaughterhouse generation after generation.\n\nI\u2019m not conservative in my political views but I truly feel for conservatives because they are always fighting a losing war. Even when they win, they lose. When you boil the topics down to guns and abortions, the worse overall choice for you becomes the only viable choice.\n\nMeanwhile \u201csocialists\u201d in parts of Europe can keep their small businesses open, work their crafts and trades that their families have done for centuries, preserve their religious values, and let other countries like America handle the \u201cprogressiveness\u201d at the cost of destroying their its own culture. But oh who am I kidding, they\u2019re crazy liberal commies and we\u2019re traditional in our pursuit of rampant change!",

However they are appointed which could be less than ideal. Also I found out a little while ago that there was a senate seat up for grabs, and you can submit yourself for application, however one of the requirements for eligibility was that you own property(which I believe in this context meant real estate) over a certain value.

I didn't step foot out of the car because I was ordered not to but they wanted to rummage through my trunk which had a lot of camping gear and clothing.

She's travelled to the States quite a bit for work over the years (actually lived in Arizona, of all places for work for 2 years), but clearly not someone who (outside of random checks, which are fair) could be seen to be much of an obvious red flag for entry to the country.\n\nThe last two times she went to the states, she was questioned, searched, was repeatedly yelled to answer \"Where she is from\", because the border guards in both cases didn't like the answer \"Canada\", and was generally treated like shit. Her friends that she was travelling with, white, weren't questioned more than the standard 2 questions and a bored glance at the passport.\n\nSince those experiences, and since Trump's election, I've vowed not to visit the US again if at all possible. \n\nOf course, you're a sovereign nation, and you have every right to set the terms (as a nation) for who is allowed to enter your country. I'm not arguing that you shouldn't. \n\nHowever, I think that if this is the direction you as a nation want your country to move (mistreating allies, having draconian entry requirements that suggests nothing but the bald abuse of power [border guards now have the right to demand access to my facebook account, didn't I hear that a while back?], then you need to accept that plenty of people will choose to cut ties with you.\n\nIt makes me really sad.

Lunatic.\n\n4/5 What kind of fork are you using for this? Or do you just use a spoon?\n\nWho eats cereal with a fork, how are you supposed to scoop up mouthfuls of the delicious syrup with each waffle without the use of a spoon?\n\n6 Where do you put the whipped cream if you're doing it this way?\n\nThere are generally two school of thought for this one, each being equally valid. For those who believe that whipped cream is essential, it is often held in a small bowl next to your meal and you add some to your spoon prior to scooping a waffle. The other school of thought believes that space taken up in your mouth by the whipped cream could be filled with glorious sticky tree juice.\n\nOn a side note, other waffle accoutrements that aren't subject to deflation/mixing such as berries can just be added to the main bowl.\n\n7 Are you talking like eggo waffles or are you making ~~belgium~~ Belgian waffles, which makes this easier?\n\nRefer to 1.\n\nI hope I have adequately answered all your questions.\n\nEdit: phone spelling hard\n\nEdit2: phone formatting harder\n\nEdit3: my gold-ginity goes to a comment about waffle-maple soup that I wrote at 2 am while procrastinating math...my parents will be so proud of me!
