Outside of the mainstream, there are websites that outright lie, although their reach has been largely hindered after tech companies went after them.\n\nAs somebody with more conservative views, I like some of Trump's policies. Curbing illegal immigration would be good for America, and it isn't wrong to claim that women are raped in staggering numbers in various migrant camps in Mexico. Stretching this claim to infer that Trump claimed all Mexicans are rapists is misleading the public.\n\nIn regards to the travel ban, I think it's important to make sure there are enough safeguards put in place to ensure that nobody with malicious intend ends up in the US. The middle east and select areas in east Asia are hotbeds for extremist activity, and these groups have explicitly said that they are going to pretend to be refugees.  There's no doubt that innocent people will be inconvenienced by this policy, but the President's number one priority is keeping American's safe.\n\nThen there's the whole Russia story. Even if there was collaboration between Trump and the Russians, it's not like Hillary's emails were made up. Getting mad at Russia for exposing Hillary's emails is like getting mad at somebody for telling your girlfriend that you're cheating on her. If you didn't cheat in the first place, you wouldn't have that problem.\n\nThe media should criticize the legitimate things wrong with Trump. His anti-environmentalism, his attitude towards other foreign leaders and his moronic social media presence. There is a lot of material there, you don't need to misrepresent anything about him to criticize him. The only problem is, media organizations need to make money, and hyperbolic journalism gets the clicks.",

There's the way the our base human instincts wish to react and there's us putting in the effort, not being lazy, and going to ensure the refs are operating the public's interests fairly.   \n\nWe've been doing human progress for thousands of years now, and we've come a long way. There's been some save points we've had to fall back on, but we are developing some useful wonders in our journey.  Our vision of a future to believe in is a guiding star. We spend time thinking it's possible and soon we know it is because our thoughts intertwine with our actions. Connect with others who think so and figure out how to make it happen. America is the wealthiest country in history, come together and wield that influence.   \n\nWe can be proactive, we can reason out what's in our best interest and lean into producing it. Be a part of that. Selfish altruism, if you know you can make a difference, help out, enjoy however you wish. Be driven by emotion & aim with reason. As long as we avoid the same greed manifest in the masses that we detest in the few, apathy.    \n\nYou are who we need. Exercise your voice, grow in power, lean into it, join together, make progress.  \n\n>Our job is to educate, to organize, to mobilize, to demand... \n\n-Bernie, [edit: Dec 6^th](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8VEQ0NUSp-M&feature=youtu.be&t=1522)\n\n",
