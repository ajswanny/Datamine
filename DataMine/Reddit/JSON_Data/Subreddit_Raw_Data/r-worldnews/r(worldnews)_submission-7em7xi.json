You don't know however what it contains beforehand.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\"The combination of money and addiction is gambling\", ruled the gambling committee. VTM News brought the news and a few days later EA withdrew the function from the game, partially because Disney complained, which has the rights to the Star Wars merchandise.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nGeens now wants to prevent that these kinds of functions will be in any games going forward. \"But that takes time, because we'll have to make a proposal to the EU. We will definitely try to ban it.\"\n\n&nbsp;\n\nEdit: changed some wording for clarification and accuracy.\n\nEdit: Thank you random stranger for my first Reddit Gold! I am glad I was able to help you and so many other people  with my translation so much that you gifted me Gold. It is greatly appreciated and I hope you have a great day like I will now have.

    "body": "My 2 cents on whether it's \"gambling\" in New Zealand (I'm a newbie lawyer, but not in this area, and haven't looked up any cases, just the legislation) - \n\nAccording to NZ's Gambling Act 2006 - \"Gambling means **paying or staking consideration**, directly or indirectly, on the outcome of something **seeking to win money when the outcome depends wholly or partly on chance**\".\n\nIf it isn't already outlawed, the key issue is whether the person is \"seeking to win money\" or simply paying for an item that is selected at random.  I ***firmly*** believe that the only reason this is uncertain at all is because the law hasn't kept up.  If made aware, its more than likely that legislators would specifically cover loot box systems in the Act.\n\nWhat is ***fucking outrageous***:  I know *for a fact* that winnings from loot boxes are **technically** taxable under the Income Tax Act, in rare and specific circumstances.  This would only be the case if you:\n\n1. sold the prizes for a profit; AND\n2. had a \"system\" to reliably make a profit (as opposed to simply having a lucky streak).\n\nThis also means that losses (buying duds) would be tax deductible.\n\nHow can something like this be caught by tax laws but not by gambling laws?\n\nI emailed the New Zealand Gambling Commission last week, and will call if I don't get a response soon.  I will be notifying the incumbent government too and see if we can't get some legislative clarity.\n\nI think everyone should do the same for their countries (contact the gambling authority and the legislators).  If you're American, I wouldn't bother - your system is way too corrupt and it is a waste of time.",

    "body": "Finally. This took a while to get from gaming forums to public domain but it was inevitable. In 2011 I gladly payed a couple dollars on launch day for a pink weapon skin in Gears of War 3. I knew exactly what I was paying for and was able to support my favourite franchise. Last October was my first experience with convoluted loot crates and an ultimatum of absurd grinding for content or monetary acceleration. Watching developers defend such infrastructure and dodge concerns has been insulting. Micro transactions aren't necessarily evil. I just want to pay for a desired item, not a chance at the item. \n\nI'm secretly glad EA gets to bear the brunt of it, Star Wars could be such a fun and accessible IP, it feels like the developers haven't even played the original Battlefront 2 (do young gamers even know that this is a severely-restricted reboot?). Twelve years ago at launch I popped in a disc and was able to play on countless maps as over a dozen heroes, space battles included such technological feats as barrel-rolls and docking in enemy frigates to fight on foot. Nothing was locked behind in-game currency or random chance rewards and this game still held my attention for years and years on good gameplay alone. The corruption of modern AAA gaming needs more exposure. Gamers aren't making the video games anymore. ",

In fact, since there seems to be a precise calculation for it, he essentially is.

I would say Reddit to the rescue once again, but I sort of have to agree with the judge on this. Even though it's not likely, it may be a welcome change.

Would they still make enough to fully support the game at the level they do currently?\n\nI also wonder how a season pass model would work. I would be perfectly fine with a $20 annual pass, but how many others would? \n\nMy unfortunate assumption is that the majority of players benefit most from the current system at the expense of those minority \u201cwhales\u201d and those who spend an irresponsible amount on loot boxes. \n\nSo the question is, if loot boxes are removed, what could possibly take their place that would provide Blizzard with enough post-sale revenue to maintain overwatch at the current level?\n\n(Keep in mind that all these thoughts relate strictly to overwatch\u2019s micro transaction model, none of that EA p2w garbage.)",

That's why they have to intentionally obfuscate the cost to trick the more vulnerable among us to pay way more then they were intending. The whole system is set up to hide the real cost of these items, which by any standard is immoral and predatory. \n\nThey don't care though, because 1 idiot spending 2k on loot boxes is worth 1000 purchases at a reasonable price.",

At least not directly. But I can see it being regulated:  \nIf your game has a function that requires money and is a game of chance (lootboxes) your game must be rated for Mature audiences. Game/service must also validate the customers age (like casinos).  \nBasically, casino regulations on games with lootbox mechanics.  \nGames with direct microtransations will be fine (maps, skins, etc).

It's just as bad as the Battlefront nonsense  \n  \nI only half agree with you I think microtransactions are bad but they actually toned it down a lot since FIFA 17 they gave players opportunities to get Packs and quite a lot of coins by simply playing the game. Plenty of people have spent nothing and still have good teams with great players.  \n  \nThe community is actually trying to boycott Black Friday right now because of the state of the game, basically EA sell the most in microtransactions during black friday ( Huge flash promos ) Sadly most of the FIFA community are casual gamers, sports fans so a lot are not aware of this. We don't even ask for much, just undo the patch and fix glitches, and make Week-end League ( Comptition happening from Friday to Monday where you have to play 40 games to win rawards ) 4 days instead of 3 or lower the game to 30-32 instead of 40.  \n  \nI really hope the community can find a way for them to do something, but I highly doubt it.  What I don't udnerstand is why they killed the game with the first patch, why fuck over a community like this, everybody loved it. Now most hate it, players who have been playing since the early FUT days are now quitting, pro players and streamers dislike the game aswell.  \n",

They spend 10+ years writing their first album, basically creating songs slowly over time since they learned how to play guitar. Then they get picked up by a label and have to write a new album in one year. It\u2019s pretty rare to find a band who can do a good second album as a follow up. \n\nI\u2019m in no way defending EA, I just think that a lot of game companies would probably fail on their second masterpiece regardless of EA\u2019s involvement. That being said, EA has also ruined dynasties, so they are definitely a common denominator in this equation. ",

    "body": "Yes.\n\nBecause if you take away the virtual item veil, it can be easily translated to: Input $1.00 for a potential of $1,000.00 (or more). \n\n\nI know this isn't how LoL works exactly, but let me try to lay it out using that as an example: Lets say you get a bunch of loot boxes & keys on your account - you spent a total of $100.00. You unlock all your boxes and !!! woah! You got a super rare discontinued Jax skin that only 10 other people have. You look up how much your account is worth now - !!! woah! Now it's worth $3,000.00. Or...let's assume you didn't get anything. But you are soooo sure that you can get that rare skin so you spend $100's and $100's of dollars on it, you start becoming obsessed with getting that skin because surely if you just could get that skin you could stop spending so much money and you could just quit and be happy with the game and then one day - YES! You did it! $15,000 later, ruined friendships, lost time, and it turns out you get extremely depressed because that skin that was worth $3,000 is now only worth $5 because the creators of the game flooded the market to discourage the black market.\n\nedit: Like I said, LoL was a bad example, but the general idea is that this sort of thing can cause people (children especially) to learn extremely dangerous spending habits. \n\nedit 2: Everyone is bringing up the idea that your account will be banned if you trade it. I have bought and sold accounts from many games in the past, never had them banned. That doesn't happen often. Virtual item sales are a huge market. \n\nedit 3: This has created quite a large discussion, of which many people have made great points. The main question was simply : Are games that offer loot chest (like CS:GO, LoL, etc) also participating in gambling? Of which I replied Yes. **of course** there is the loophole that allows it to happen because everyone technically gets something, and people are also making the case that it is similar to trading card games - I totally agree. However I also believe that it's (as I put it earlier) Gambling-lite\u00ae. Conditioning kids to love that dopamine hit from getting pack after pack after pack and then FINALLY YES A CHARIZARD. Now I must get 1,000 MORE packs because I hit that 1:1000 chance of getting it. Same shit with OSRS. People spend days and days grinding that game just to HOPEFULLY hit that RNGJesus. \n\nedit 4: The main issue I have with this is that yes - if you are an adult and you want to spend $15,000 on anything, that's your prerogative. The issue comes in the form of children who play these games who may not know the value of a dollar and blow their parents/their own money on it, which can lead to issues with budgeting in the future. \n\nfinal edit: I do not really believe that loot crates are an issue. I enjoy earning little boxes of goodies from playing, and I enjoy what I get out of them. My only concern is that you can pay real money to get them, and that adds an entirely different angle to the entire thing. Loot boxes are harmless - you get rewards for playing - but when you tie them to money...it's a new beast. ",

My dad's this guy probably around 6'5\", I'm a little dude comin' in at 5'7\".\n\nObviously I was terrified, but my dad sat me down and talked to me about the importance of working and the importance of money. He wasn't screaming, wasn't mad, he was understanding and really gentle about it because he knew I was just a kid who made a dumb mistake, but he let it be known to not let it happen again.\n\nI learned a great lesson from it.\n\nI love my dad.",

    "body": "Okay, so as a magic player and investor, I'll say that hearthstone is pretty much equal to magic in how close it is to gambling. Take it as you will.\n\nSo while there are certainly cards that are worth something due to being rare, especially older cards, most of them have high prices due to the competitive nature of them. Generally expensive cards are seen in powerful decks in big tournaments like the pro-tour or Grand Prix, and that creates a chain reaction. Even people that play the investment game do the same thing. They know x card will be powerful or x set will be competitive and buy while it's cheap.\n\nIf Wizards decides to fuck everything up, let's say can all sanction tournaments (from the pro-tour to friday night magic) and stop making sets, the whole market will immediately tank. Local gaming stores will no longer want to carry it, and cards that aren't physically hard to come by (aka most valued cards) will be worth about the cardboard they're printed on, which can be considered \"worth nothing notable.\" While you may have something physical compared to hearthstone, you did just lose a ton of money.\nThis kinda translates into loot boxes. Is a kid buying a booster pack, hoping he will get a foiled tarmagoyf in a modern masters box not the same as a kid hoping he can get the ability card or whatever in Battlefront 2? Odds are they're not going to get what they wanted and are probably willing to try again. Especially if it's not their own money, and like I said it's the same thing with hearthstone.\n\nWhile I think loot boxes are terrible, I can't not see the gleaming hypocrisy we face while dealing with other genres of games. Especially with hearthstone vs magic, because in a face-to-face value, hearthstone has the better options than magic does.\n\nedit: For transparency's sake and so I don't have to repeat myself: I don't like or play hearthstone. Constant's in gambling doesn't mean it's not gambling. Just because the magic booster pack system is \"familiar\" doesn't make it not gambling, just because you know what you can potentially get, doesn't make it not gambling. ",

Before you couldn't see it but now there is an indicator showing you which players he is controlling himself, this made defending manually incredibly hard as you can see whch player he is controlling to trying to intercept or tackle you.  \n  \nAll they had to do after release was to slightly nerf shooting, slightly upgrade the goalkeepers and nerf the longshots. And do something about players hitting the post way too often  \n  \nBasically the game went from a game rewarding the player who was the better, to absolute random.

If Dad wants to let little Susie use his credit card to unlock a couple loot boxes, now his card is on file for the next 100 loot boxes that Susie unlocks. Even though it was an adult who initiated the first purchase, it was on behalf of the minor and was unrestricted for the minor to continue making purchases. The game companies specifically help facilitate this process, so that they can get as much money out of Susie as they can before Dad gets wise and cuts off the card. And even if children aren't the \"intended audience\" they are most certainly unregulated collateral damage.\n\nThis doesn't compare to card packs. If Dad wants to buy Susie some MTG cards, he makes the purchase with his card or cash, and that is that. If Susie has an allowance and goes and buys more cards with her cash, then she is forced to stop when her allowance is out. \n\nAnd psychological studies have shown time after time that in-person cash purchases \"hurt\", and we are more likely to control spending behavior when we are handing over physical bills in trade for goods/services. So the addiction cycle is much harder to snowball in cash (or even with credit-swipe-every-time) than it is on a one-click digital purchase.\n\nAll this to say, I think that trading card manufacturers would be able to make a pretty good argument to differentiate themselves from loot boxes.\n\n(Side note: in my state, minors aren't even allowed to play those crane-grabs-the-stuffed-animal games without an adult present, because it is seen as a form of light gambling)",

I doubt even EA would dare make it worse.\n\nDisney has been known in the past to pull games from devs and develop them in house or elsewhere (NES days for instance) so EA should be worried right now. its not so much they will lose stock or rep, its more the fact that they are about to lose a MASSIVE contract (starwars + disney) and thats a hell of a lot of money.",

    "body": "I couldn't pinpoint where it started specifically, everyone has a different opinion on that but the cosmetics as an idea I believe came about because of PC modding. The fact that you could swap models/textures early on and shit like that was a big factor between buying a game on pc or buying it on console. \n\nConsoles had the market cornered on being able to sell what was essentially a mod in a PC game. You look at what Valve did with PC games where they put in Cvars on public servers that prevented you from model swapping under the guise of it being used to cheat in various ways, and this was true. I remember in the early days of CS:Source being able to mod out walls, or make heads bigger and so forth, so they battled that for a long time, creating limitations in model size, what could be texture swapped and so forth. The side effect of that going into Tf2 was that modding decent weapons and things became extremely difficult, so they introduced new weapons and things like that and eventually now colloquial \"Hats\". \n\nThat's probably where it really took off, the biggest blow back early on was when they tried to sell the infamous horse armor in Oblivion which was already being heavily modded on PC and so it was sort of a slap in the face. Modding is what made certain games popular, and in the case of already popular games, it's what gave them Longevity, see Skyrim. Years later, having seemingly learned nothing from that PR disaster they introduced paid mods on Steam, and that went over famously, hilariously bad and there are tons of articles about that fiasco online.\n\nMaps were really to me the first big change and EA was at the forefront of this with the Battlefield series. Maps gave FPS games infinite life so long as the fundamentals of the game were sound; See Counter Strike. Battlefield 2 had a map editor but it was notoriously difficult to use and harder still to get a community going around said map. So come Bad Company 2 which was I think the next game release on PC of that series, they removed the editor and there was a massive outcry about it. People believed that EA's plan was to sell map packs instead, many people said this would never happen, no one would pay for what used to be a free mod, it made sense on the consoles with CoD people would say, arguing that someone had to pay for server costs, certification and whatever else, but PC? Not necessary, total cash grab. I don't recall them actually selling maps from Bad Company, I know they released a couple, and they had a DLC for it which was actually great, but they certainly went this route once Battle Field 3 shipped out.\n\n\nBasically it's been a long journey by developers to cash in on the Modding communities they see the hundreds of thousands of Downloads on things like the Nexus and think man if only we could get paid for this. Hindsight is interesting, Blizzard has said that they take into account what skins people use most when it comes to design decisions. Look at some of the most popular armor and weapons mods in Fallout New Vegas and you'll see a great deal of them influenced the designs in Fallout 4. Even when they can't directly take someones mod they'll certainly use the communities to dictate game design for them and give them nothing in return.\n\nModding has made some game studios far more money, and far more popularity than most developers will ever give credit to, since as well as we're often told, we think we want things but they have the research to prove otherwise.",
