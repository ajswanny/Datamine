FIDE is concerned exclusively with chess activities. FIDE is democratically established and bases itself on the principles of equal rights of its members. FIDE is a non-profit making organisation. **It rejects discriminatory treatment for national, political, racial, social or religious reasons or on account of gender.** It observes strict neutrality in the internal affairs of the national chess federations.\n\n> a. FIDE events (competitions, congresses, meetings) may be hosted only by Federations where **free access is generally assured to representatives of all Federations**.\n\n> b. The General Assembly may take exceptions for reasons of state of war or severe violence between countries, only on a three quarter majority vote.\n\nCorrupt bastards.",

I don't have any stats to back it up but I'd confidently infer it has one of the lowest profit to input ratios of just about any discipline. Including being a fast food worker. \n\nProfessional chess players are consumed utterly by the game from extremely young ages in order to compete at the top level - they eat and breath it just about every moment of their days. If you, as a major governing chess body, want to sustain an ever growing competitive scene that will continually attract new players who are prepared to put in that amount of dedication then you need to take every single dollar you can get.\n\nAmerica doesn't give a shit about chess - the money is in baseball and basketball and football. Tournament chess relies heavily on individually wealthy contributors and patrons that have an interest in the game, because it is not enough to rely on advertising revenue or corporate sponsorship for what is a relatively small scene. Unfortunately, Saudi Arabia happens to be one of those countries with a large pool of very wealthy and very bored individuals looking for things to put their name on.",

Women are labeled as mentally ill for wanting to wear what they want or having full control of what happens to their own bodies or having a say in who they marry.

    "body": "This is a really complicated question. One would think that unlike athletics, where no obvious genetic factors prevent men and women competing on a level playing field, it wouldn't be necessary. But in practice, there has only ever been one woman (Judit Polgar) in the world top 10, and she's a huge anomaly. To give a glimpse of how much, there are 42 chess players currently rated [over 2700](https://2700chess.com/), and not one of them is female. (The rating system is based purely on strength calculated by results against other players).\n\nThere has been much controversy about why this is, with maybe the most popular explanation being pressure from gender roles/misogynistic culture driving girls away from the sport at a young age (and an early start is crucial). Others claim an innate aptitude difference between men and women, although this is a more and more marginal view.\n\nRegardless, it's still controversial whether the separation of titles is a good thing for women in chess or not. Judit Polgar was not in favour of it. I can see why it could be seen as patronizing (being based on the premise that women can't compete with men). But at the very least it gives women a chance to compete for cash prizes and recognition without having to beat the most elite male players (which currently there is little chance of), which should motivate more women to make a serious go of it.\n\n**Edit:** It's also worth noting that there are no 'men only' tournaments. Women can and do compete in the main chess events and compete for the overall World Champion title, they just have an additional Women's World Champion title that is obviously female only. ",

    "body": ">I GOT MY FIRST GLIMPSE OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ON Feb. 10, 1996, at 4:45 p.m. EST, when in the first game of my match with Deep Blue, the computer nudged a pawn forward to a square where it could easily be captured. It was a wonderful and extremely human move. If I had been playing White, I might have offered this pawn sacrifice. It fractured Black's pawn structure and opened up the board. Although there did not appear to be a forced line of play that would allow recovery of the pawn, my instincts told me that with so many \"loose\" Black pawns and a somewhat exposed Black king, White could probably recover the material, with a better overall position to boot.\n\n>But a computer, I thought, would never make such a move. A computer can't \"see\" the long-term consequences of structural changes in the position or understand how changes in pawn formations may be good or bad.\n\nHe might've been a sore loser but when he wrote for TIME in '96 he was self-aware and appreciative.\n\nninja edit: link http://content.time.com/time/subscriber/article/0,33009,984305-1,00.html",

But it\u2019s what we want of those people because they have an enormous amount of attention and praise lavished upon them. Our better selves want that praise given to people we feel are deserving of it. How awful to think that some selfish jerk is getting all of it, right? \n\nSo we want them to use their spotlight to shine it on other things, like being a good example, bringing attention to worthy causes, and basically **helping us feel less guilt** for loving someone who essentially has a meaningless skill but is given the world for performing well. \n\nIt\u2019s not about what they are or what we honestly believe they are by default but what we wish them to be.
