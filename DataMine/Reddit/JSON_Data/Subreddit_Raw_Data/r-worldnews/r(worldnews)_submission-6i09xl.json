    "body": "As an American who's lived in London a long time, I can tell you witnessing my first hooligan fight outbreak was an ordeal. \n\nI can recall it as though it were yesterday: Brighton train station, the main one by the beach. Was trying to get back to London after a Gay Pride related event, and it turns out a sporting event was scheduled along the same section of beach there not far from the pier (a huge live watching event along the shore of an important match, not sure which teams as I am not a sports fan in general and wasn't really paying attention as I had been dancing for roughly 12 straight hours at that point and had ingested enough glitter to kill a small animal, which is a stereotype but very much true in this case) and something kicked off around the ticket booths as we were walking past them. \n\nA large bald white man in a sea of large white men with minor variations (scars, weird eyebrows, surprisingly good looking but drunk in public at 2 PM, etc.) decided to fight still another large white man (wearing a flat cap but it was not a jaunty tweed one, just a plain black one, which arguably is much more fitting anyway) wearing a slightly differently coloured (yet similarly patterned) scarf. \n\nApparently, these scarves are essentially tribal markings. They congeal together into massive groups by these colours, as otherwise, even the individuals who are not bald or white may be confused in the sea of drunken, drunken, extremely drunken people, and wind up in the wrong tribe. Which is Super Bad. Do Not Do That.\n\nI also need to make this very clear: Cheap cider is to them what Spinach is to Popeye. This is not an exaggeration. \n\nThey gain X-MEN like powers, akin to the Juggernaut. Nothing can harm them except someone suggesting the police may be attempting to start kettling the crowd, and even then, in an enraged state, they may begin to actively attack police, in a mindless Hulk fury.\n\nHowever, many of the twiggier hooligans, similar to the X-MEN Cyclops, are sort of actually mostly total weenies. They hang out in gaggles of fellow weenies in order to appear louder and more intimidating. They may make up for their lack of individual strength in terms of sheer number, so be wary. Also, they too are drunk. \n\nIn fact, everyone is drunk. Everyone in the immediate vicinity almost becomes drunk via proximity drunkness. You feel less able to drive purely by looking at them, even if you don't have a driver's license to begin with. You pat yourself down to hand off keys that you don't own, automatically. \n\nIf you are in the area, there is a good chance that you too are drunk, I mean like to begin with, even if you have absolutely no connection to sports whatsoever. \n\nI was there for gay pride, and I ended up in a train station loaded with striped angry people and explaining to a police officer that no, I am not here to assault anyone with this Absolutely Fabulous themed gift bag, and that yes I am drunk but on my way home, not on my way to a beach sporting event in these shoes. Jesus Goddddd. (Again, stereotypical, but it was Gay Pride and I was drunk and I'm being faithful to the memory, here. I think I actually said exactly those words, but it was for sure along those lines, anyway. They laughed and let me go. Good cops! Thanks Brighton. Although I guess they had way worse shit to deal with...)\n\nHooliganism seems to just occur to those of us who aren't aware of sports schedules. I go for a pint, halfway through, there's suddenly ten thousand striped people. Always with stripes. Why always the stripes on the scarves for the thing you're doing? It's blinding me. I'm already confused by so much white and so much bald. \n\n(Why do the fighters always tend to be white and bald? I've noticed this trend, and don't want to immediately jump to white supremacy bullshit as I don't know anything about hooliganism actually, or what issues lie around/within UK sports culture. But that seems likely, to me. Not sure, just basing it off of the fights I've seen kick off and the type of shit people are shouting etc. as it goes on. I always leave though, so I don't know what the MO is, if any other than cider and sports. I've heard of connections, and it seems legit to me, but I really don't think about sports or hooliganism much or know much about that side of it.) \n\nAnyway, yes, this is the best I can do as an American to maybe explain a little to fellow Americans what the experience is like, a little. (It's also 2 AM and I had a long day, so I'm sorry if this is incoherent or goes nowhere. I tried to contribute something, lmao.)\n\nEdit: A Word.\n\nEdit 2: Added more \"d\"s to \"Jesus God\" for what I like to call gay emphasis. ",
