This woman has rubella (German measles), but her favorite film star is in town, so she goes out, anyway, so she can see her. Unbeknownst to the fan, the actress is pregnant. She ends up giving birth to a baby with mental retardation, who's put in an institution. The doctors tell her that the child's condition is caused by exposure to rubella during pregnancy. \n\nShe never has another biological child. Her life is miserable and ruined. Then one day, she runs across the fan, who tells her the story of going to see her, not realizing that in doing so, she's telling her that she's the one who exposed her to rubella and hurt her unborn baby. The actress poisons her drink in revenge.\n\nThat story is why I fear rubella more than the other childhood diseases. It's also something I think about when I hear about people who *don't* vaccinate their children. It's not just about your kid. It's not just about you. Yes, there's a chance that your child will develop pneumonia and die, but that's your funeral expense, not mine. My concern (and most other people's) is that that sick child will expose other people to it, and that's not someone else's fucking right to do. It's practically manslaughter. \n\nAt the barest minimum, if you don't vaccinate and your child gets sick, that child had better stay home for weeks and weeks (easily done if he's not allowed in school, I guess). And not just home from school--home from everything. Sports, the grocery store, playing with his friends, everything. And everyone in his family, too, since adults often get milder versions of these diseases and could spread it. Do a full [Eyam-scale quarantine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eyam) on that shit. ",

I'm not anti vaxx in the slightest, but I had a bad reaction as a baby to pertussis and couldn't continue the 3 shot schedule with it. \n\nMy middle brother was the same way, so the doctor recommended not even trying it on my youngest brother. In fact the doctor said if my mother had had another 10 kids he wouldn't have given them the vaccine either. Is there any kind of provision for something like that? I'm in the US so it doesn't effect me but I'm just curious. \n\nPart of the reason I'm a huge proponent for vaccines is because of the fact that I couldn't be properly vaccinated for pertussis. I'm genuinely fearful of contracting it because of all of the people who are choosing not to vaccinate. It's making a come back in the US.\n\nEdit: Thank you for all the replies. I'm not trying to make this an issue and certainly not trying to \"fuel antivaxxers\" I just wanted to know at who's discretion it was for cases like this. I now know it is doctor discretion.

I haven't been able to find a reputable study either conclusively proving or disproving this correlation. A [research paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4266455/) from 2014 that indicates that it *may* be caused by the vaccine (causal relation) and that more research is needed using information from French health insurance data - but as we know, correlation doesn't automatically mean causation. It would be very interesting to see the results of a study performed with the additional information.\n\nWhile I don't believe that our current vaccines are harmful in any way and I'm 100% pro vaccines (and will continue to try to talk sense into anti vaxxers), this could explain the widespread skepticism in France about vaccines. Then again, most of those people are pro-homeopathy too and I don't think many of them even have heard of the Hep B vaccine thing (I've only ever heard it referenced by my mother), so it's probably just widespread gullibility/idiocy.",

Asperger's was included as a form of Autism in the fifth addition of the DSM (the manual for mental disorders) and this has resulted in a higher diagnosis level of Autism. There's also an argument that some misdiagnosis is happening - as Asperger's is a milder form of autism, it's possible that some kids are being diagnosed as having Asperger's Syndrome when really they're just a bit eccentric. The former editor of the DSM (sorry, can't remember his name) expresses this concern in Jon Ronson's book 'The Psychopath Test' ",

It could be that there were less autistic people back then, but then it also hit me: Autistic people were not integrated into the education system back then, and probably went into special needs schools, or didn't go to schools at all (at least in my country), and there was probably a certain social stigma attached. That, along with higher diagnosis rates, might have to do with the perception that autism was less prevalent before... but who knows.",

Just like that.\") Of course it's not identification/diagnosis/awareness alone. I also think that as each generation is exposed to more and more chemicals we will continue seeing autism numbers rise. There are also genetic studies going on that are attempting to map the indicators of autism. On mobile - no link, but I can find some later if needed. \n\nI'm glad my Aspie husband was vaccinated.

However, more than 60% of these cases (14,697) were in a single year, 2011. Since then the cases have dropped to under 900 in 2012 and under 400 in every following year, with just 63 last year. This excludes cases from vaccines and imported cases. \n\nthis certainly argues against the idea that \"outbreaks are increasingly common across Europe\", but when you look at Europe as a whole, the number of measles cases in dropping. From a high of almost 30,000 in 2010 and 2011 they have plummeted to ~4000 for the last two years. ",
