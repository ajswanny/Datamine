A quick read through of certain passages and exposure to the first Muslim group that justifies their emotional hatred can lead them to think that this extremist group is on the right Islamic path. Family & Friends of the Paris attackers talked about how they weren't religious, didn't go to the mosque and had a variety of past crimes before committing suicide. The 9/11 hijackers were reported to have visited Las Vegas, gambled, drank, visited strip club. Plenty of isis new recruits are new to the faith, [ordering books like 'Islam for Dummies'](https://newrepublic.com/article/119182/jihadists-buy-islam-dummies-amazon) before they join the group. In 2008, a classified briefing note on radicalisation, prepared by MI5\u2019s behavioural science unit revealed that *\"far from being religious zealots, a large number of those involved in terrorism do not practise their faith regularly. Many lack religious literacy and could ... be regarded as religious novices.\u201d* The analysts concluded that *\"a well-established religious identity actually protects against violent radicalisation\"*.",

Daesh will probably will never be able to strike Italy, not that they don't try.\n\n The reason is that traditional police work in Italy, HUMINT is considered more important than SIGINT. Terrorist attacks are foiled not by *collecting intelligence* but instead by *applying intelligence*.\n\nItaly has a long history of domestic terrorist, either political or from the Mafia. The experience of the Italian Police, Carabinieri and SISMI in counter terrorism is greater than any other western country. They don't collect massive amount of data, they instead operate around the concept that these attacks are politically motivated and they focus their attention in those areas. \n\n'Islamic' extremists are not going to rise from the local church youth group. The police will not waste resources with the surveillance of millions of targets that will not radicalise. This allows the most underfunded police force in Europe (relative to population and area) to foil every terrorist plan. \n\nI suggest you to check what happened in Venezia recently, in regards to the arrest of 3 terrorists that were about to hit Rialto in a similar way to the tragedy of Manchester. There lays the diffence in approach and the solution to terrorism.",

This is because they are no longer exposed to more moderate, mainstream ideology.\n\nA similar example I can think of that Americans can relate to is Malcolm X. He was initially a member of the Nation of Islam and believed their teachings, that black and white people couldn't coexist. He went on the holy pilgrimage of Hajj to Mecca and saw another version of Islam that taught something different. He came back with a different belief, that all men were equal and could live together. He rejected the extremism of the Nation of Islam for a more moderate version of Islam.\n\nWhat I'm trying to get at is that if you ban people with extremist views from the mosque, they never get the chance to accept a more moderate version of Islam.

When there is a conspiracy, some of the people slip up, or the plot is sophisticated and an alarm gets set off somewhere: the police roll everybody up. After 9/11 it became a priority for police and intelligence agencies to stop terror networks, and they do this quite well.\n\nWhat is more difficult to stop is \"inspired\" terrorism, or lone wolf attacks, where the attacker had only minimal (or no direct contact) with a known terrorist group. It's also difficult to profile these people... vaguely, they tend to be maladjusted young men with some history of petty crime or violence, who became radicalized rather quickly, but that's not alot to go off of. Stopping these people is similar to stopping a school shooter, or spree killer: you have to have good community policing and local resources to pick up on breadcrumbs, or tips, or small behaviours, before the plot is realized. Because these incidents are not supported by a network, they tend to be rather simple, with what the attacker can get their hands on in terms of weapons. Detecting these people is difficult... the Berlin truck attacker for example, was watched by German intelligence, but they deemed him not to be a threat. \n\nNow, Manchester though is being investigated as a network-supported terror event; few people have the know-how to make bombs, so generally that indicates some network, but also as we've seen in the news there have been arrests in the UK and in Libya. If it turns out that a terror-network existed in the UK, that will be very concerning for British police... I'm sure they're reviewing the decision now that classified the Manchester attacker as \"low threat\" to see how it was made. ",

The easiest way overall to catch terrorists to catch several all working on a conspiracy together as the chatter leaves them open to being caught. Lone wolves, or small clusters like this one, are especially tricky to find because you don't have the resources to monitor everyone all the time.

It's also difficult to profile these people... vaguely, they tend to be maladjusted young men with some history of petty crime or violence, who became radicalized rather quickly, but that's not alot to go off of. Stopping these people is similar to stopping a school shooter, or spree killer: you have to have good community policing and local resources to pick up on breadcrumbs, or tips, or small behaviours, before the plot is realized. Because these incidents are not supported by a network, they tend to be rather simple, with what the attacker can get their hands on in terms of weapons. Detecting these people is difficult... the Berlin truck attacker for example, was watched by German intelligence, but they deemed him not to be a threat.\n\nRight, but [leaders in society keep blaming the communities for not reporting the terrorists in their midst](http://nypost.com/2017/05/21/trump-urges-muslim-leaders-to-drive-out-terrorists/). The blame therefore needs to fall back on the leadership, if communities are doing their part to say: \"this guy is a problem, he's gonna do something bad,\" then the investigative agencies need to do their part.",

He himself only knew that Kumnick was a member of CSA. After the sting, the ATF and FBI had no intent to press charges, but only use him to spy on Kumnick. When he refused, they pressed charges, arrested him and he was bailed out, gave him the wrong court date, issued a bench warrant when he did not show up to court a month early, charged him in absentee and attempted to arrest him.\nThe FBI sent overwatch teams to the woods who harrassed the family, then fired first shot and killed Weaver's son and dog in the woods instead of confronting them. They then issued highly controversial shoot on sight orders for Harris and Randy Weaver, eventually shooting Weaver and killing his wife when they were unarmed and running. The whole operation was a cluster fuck and Weaver and Harris ended up acquitted of all charges, but with a now dead family and no compensation. Over an unnecessary weapons charge.\n\nEdit: he was compensated, but is a few million dollars really worth the lives of your son and wife, and the trauma that your while family had to endure from being hunted unjustly? From having your mother's head splattered on your children?",

I don't disagree that some people may think this way, but it's kind of like someone looking for a reason to act on their feelings. So they instigate and hope someone defends themselves (\"they started it!\") to feel justified. \n\nLike a bully getting all up in the face of someone very aggressively, yelling \"i dare you to touch me\" and the victim shoves the bully to just get him off his chest, then the bully bunches him in the face. \n\nI would not look at the bully as justified in his actions; he was asking for it and looking for someone to lay a finger on him. If this victim doesn't shove him away, he'll keep going around until someone does. Maybe he won't even wait for someone to shove him, because really he just has this anger and wants to take it out on people. \n\n\nI don't know, it's a very tricky situation and dependent on the details. But i think pledging allegiance to ISIS is very serious. That means supporting all the terrorist attacks previously. If we know this about them, do we let them go on and hope someone or something doesn't trigger them? What do we do with kids who made a comment about bringing a gun to school and shooting it up?\n\nAgain i'm not saying a potential terrorist won't react that way and become an actual terrorist. Plus, we probably can't incarcerate them forever.  \n",

    "body": "I get what you mean. The word itself is derived from the arabic \"juhd\" which means effort. Jihaad itself, within the sphere of Islam means any effort to progress Islam in the world, and like I said, it can mean improving your own self as well as contributing positively to society. The most common meaning, of course, is the one you know: Holy War, Jihaad-bis-Saif, or Jihaad of the Sword. It *is* considered to be the greatest form of Jihaad, but it is governed by some very strict rules, including the fact that it can only be declared by the leader of a nation. The rest is concerned with ethics (don't hurt women, children or elders, don't ravage the land, poison the waters etc. It's fairly comprehensive). \n\nNowadays the term has mostly just been co-opted for the sake of political manipulation, since people are so easily motivated by religious sentiment. In Pakistan the last time the term Jihaad was enthusiastically thrown around was during the Soviet War in Afghanistan, and we aided the US Proxy War there by arming the *Mujahideen* (that word, as you may have guessed, does mean someone engaging in Jihaad). It was then used for Kashmiri seperatists fighting in the disputed state, and most recently, for our military fighting those same Mujahideen from Afghanistan, who are now terrorists. Terrorist organizations similarly use the term by taking liberties with the definition of the \"nation\" whose leaders must declare said Jihaad or refusing to recognize said states. Heck, Religion-centric political parties declare Jihaad against shit like corruption if they aren't getting enough votes. \n\nSorry I went on for a while there, but I hoped that helped you understand better.
