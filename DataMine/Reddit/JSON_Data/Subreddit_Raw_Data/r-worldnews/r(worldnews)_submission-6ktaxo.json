I managed to plant a sycamore and a beech tree at the top of my garden, where there's plenty of room, but i keep finding tiny saplings growing among the pots that already have larger saplings and treelings in them.\n\nYesterday i took a horse chestnut, a sycamore and a pear tree that i'd been growing for three years, and planted them in the local woodland. The woodland is cultivated, and there's a patch that was planted about twenty years ago, over an old filled-in sand quarry. I tried digging with a trowel, and after the first four inches of soil there were just rocks and rocks and roots, all the way down to pure sand and eventually, i assume, a turtle.\n\nIt was a chore planting those three trees, between fairly established trees, among all those tiny sandstone rocks. But boy was it worth it! (Except, i went to check on them today and water them in, and half the leaves have been eaten already by deer...)\n\nI would *love* to have a local area of arable land where i could just keep planting trees. That would suit me perfectly. :)",

It had a section on India and I explicitly remember one of the problems was that logging and construction companies backed by the corrupt government came in and basically ruined the environment and part of the way they \"fixed\" it was they replanted the trees. But they replanted pine trees because they were the cheapest, not the native walnut trees and such thus ultimately causing greater ecological damage.\n\nMy point is planting the proper trees is as important as planting them at all.

Old-time villages used to have a tree in the middle of the village under which the \"panchayat\" -- the local governing body -- met. Even education was imparted under a certain tree. You were no guru if you had no tree to sit under, so to speak. All this is good news for the future, especially when combined with large-scale initiatives in China.

Very few trees that are planted (an even smaller proportion if they naturally seeded) will make it past the five year mark due to things like being poorly planted, eaten by animals, not enough rain, too much rain, trampling, insect damage, competition from other plant species, and disease. I've worked in reforestation and urban habitat restoration for a few years now, and the fact of the matter is that you need to plant an enormous number of trees to ensure that a small number of them actually make it to maturity. The only way to get a good survival rate is to have frequent maintenance of your planting sites, and with 66 million trees, that's just not viable. Nevertheless, it's a very commendable initiative, but 66 million trees planted is not going to work out to 66 million mature trees down the road. ",

Also countries like Indonesia are poor and palm oil is an easy way to create jobs because the palm oil is easy to export.\n\nWhen you have a country that is filled with many poor people they don't care about getting rid of the rain forest, especially when the \"save the rainforest\" comments are coming from rich western countries.\n\nIndonesia is the top deforestation country and based on current rates the vast majority of Indonesia's rain forests will be gone within a decade. Also just to show how fast the rate of deforestation is. From 1990 to 2000, Indonesia lost a whopping 20% of their forest lands and the rate of deforestation since then has actually increased even further.\n\nShowtime made a pretty significant documentary on the [topic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vzl7kVNbLe0) which pretty much showed that Inodensia's rain forests are pretty much screwed.

As a consequence of the mass influx of factories and shit, pollution went way up too(which also had very bad effects for various resident of both India and China).\n\nIn a nutshell, India and China started polluting a lot, while America was trying to tighten the environmental laws and this lead to Indians and Chinese getting jobs that were supposed to be for American workers.

But what about before though. The west(west in a very strict sense) on their way to development polluted the shit out of OUR planet and now they say 'pls stahp no more'. I stress 'our' planet because i know it doesnt matter who does the act, we are all on the receiving end of this.\n\nAnyway , what I meant to say was that people are angry in our country about the fact that west refuses to take responsibility for their centuries of polluting and right when a massive percentage of our population could finally eat meal 3 times a day due to the development and industrialisation, they are saying we have to stop. People find this difficult to digest even though they know that we are all part of this destruction process.\n\nAs of right now i guess its not fair from the US to not accept differential responsibilties on the climate front. From what I know and see around me, India knows there is a problem and we are working hard to tackle it within our limits.

And again, its the long term plan.  We should have had cisterns and a desalinization project done first, *then* planted trees.  But we made a mistake, and our efforts were lost (not to mention valuable dollars that were wasted and will have to be spent  again.\n\nI know I am speaking anecdotally, but I have seen 3rd world living conditions up close, and I know that most families do not have extra water or time to tend a tree. \n\nAgain, not to be a downer.  I am really hoping that the program is successful.  And certainly the Monsoon is a big boost.  Let's hope that they are able to sustain the trees and it becomes a seen benefit for the WHOLE community.  If you can get village elders to share the importance, and then the community rallies behind it, the long term benefits of the program have a much better chance.",
