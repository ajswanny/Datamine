(I'm a bot)\n*****\n> Instead of paying Irish corporation tax of 12.5%, or the US rate of 35%, Apple&#039;s avoidance structure helped it reduce its tax rate on profits outside of the US to the extent that its foreign tax payments rarely amounted to more than 5% of its foreign profits, and in some years dipped below 2%. The European Commission calculated the rate of tax for one of Apple&#039;s Irish companies for one year had been just 0.005%. Apple came under pressure in 2013 in the US Senate, when CEO Tim Cook was forced to defend its tax system.\n\n> In order to keep its tax rates low, Apple needed to find an offshore financial centre that would serve as the tax residency for its Irish subsidiaries.\n\n> Apple chose Jersey, a UK Crown dependency that makes its own tax laws and which has a 0% corporate tax rate for foreign companies.\n\n\n*****\n[**Extended Summary**](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/7b7n6b/apple_the_worlds_most_profitable_firm_has_a/) | [FAQ](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/31b9fm/faq_autotldr_bot/ \"Version 1.65, ~241557 tl;drs so far.\") | [Feedback](http://np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23autotldr \"PM's and comments are monitored, constructive feedback is welcome.\") | *Top* *keywords*: **Apple**^#1 **tax**^#2 **Ireland**^#3 **Irish**^#4 **company**^#5",

Using subsidiaries, foreign shell companies, or anything else like that to hold money overseas should be considered hiding assets and tax evasion.  Apple claims to be headquartered in the US.  They need to be treated like US citizens.  They need to pay taxes based on their income.  They can subtract foreign tax paid, but if they hide the cash in a 0% tax haven, well, then that amount is taxed at the full rate in the US.  If the cash is earned in a 4% tax nation and their rate in the US is 35%, then they write off the 4% and pay 31% here.\n\nIf they don't like that, they can abandon the US entirely.  Some other company will produce phones and tablets and computers and pay the taxes while Apple sees their share price plummet without access to the US market.\n\nAnd I don't just mean Apple.  Any company that tries to evade their rightful payments and stick us peons with the increased bill can suck it. \n\nedit:  I accidentally a word",

On the face of it, that seems like they are not acting in the best interests of their shareholders.\n\nThen I realized: if they brought that money home, had it taxed, and then distributed it to their shareholders (where it gets taxed again), their shareholders receive less value than if the company just holds the cash and its stock price goes up by an equivalent amount. Then the shareholders only have to pay capital gains tax on the higher value of their shares, rather than the corporate tax plus personal income tax on the dividend. As a bonus, the money gets to sit there to shield the corporation against a rainy day.\n\nIf we taxed capital gains on securities above the combined rate of the corporate tax and the individual income tax that would be paid, this situation would probably resolve itself.\n\nEven lowering the corporate tax rate to 20% won't resolve this, because the combined corporate tax + individual income tax will still be higher. Even if we lowered the corporate tax to zero, it would be higher.\n\nI don't think this money is coming home unless we find another way to convince them.\n\nEdit: dammit autocorrect.",

Those who don't, don't.\n\nSo if you're making $30k a year and have a kid or two, you're probably paying zero income tax or actually getting tax welfare. \n\nIf you're making $80k a year, your tax bill goes up quite a bit.\n\nBut here's the crucial point... a natural person (a human being) earns income, pays tax, and has the rest to spend. An artificial person (a corporation) earns income, spends whatever, and pays tax on what is left over.\n\nThat little change makes for an enormous difference.\n\nSo when Apple sells a bazillion iPhone X's, it earns a lot of income. But then Apple has to pay all of its overhead, including technology licensing fees to other companies (also Apple, but foreign Apple). So US-based Apple has no income left over to pay income taxes on.\n\nA lot of people justifiably see this as unfair, and I agree. But the answer is not to make corporations pay tax on gross income.

A tripped detector removes any legal right for you to get your phone fixed. Their sensors were also much more sensitive than other brands, you didn't have to drop it in water or get rain into it, since they were on the outside just simply sweating on it would be enough.\n\nConsumers that had issues with their phones (vibration not working properly etc) were then told that the warranty didn't apply because the detector had gone off, and since Apple (at least back then) didn't repair any phones, only replaced them, they left their customers hanging even though they had a legal right to warranty. The article then said that a lot of people had contacted the journalists with similar stories.\n\nThat's when I decided that a company that treats their customers that way, deliberately creating a system so they could get away with not repairing phones that weren't broken by the consumer to begin with, that company don't deserve any of my money. I'm not going to sponsor that behavior.\n\nIf you're Swedish and want to read the article you can google \"Apple iPhone fuktdetektor garanti\", the article is on G\u00f6teborgspostens website and it's from 2010. I can't tab out or this page will reload. Google translate might work for non-english people. It's old news though but it's there.",

The income flows through and gets taxed on the business owners' individual returns.\n\nSometimes small businesses are structured as a C Corporation though, the kind of entity that pays taxes at both the corporate level and individual level via dividends. (Yes, that is double taxation, and that is why a lot of people, myself included, think corporate level taxes are silly and redundant.)\n\nI do year end tax planning for all of my clients, including these C Corporations that might owe corporate level tax on income during the year. I look at their net taxable income and make sure the owner expenses all of that extra taxable income via bonuses for the shareholders or employees before the year end. Voila, zero taxable income at the corporate level. (It is picked up as income on the individuals' side and taxed there - but double taxation is avoided though.)\n\nSo what we have here is a system where large global megacorps avoid taxes and funnel their income to low tax countries and wait for a tax holiday to repatriate their income to the USA. And small companies avoid paying corporate taxes by a pretty simple and standard tax trick: expensing all of the taxable corporate income via payroll. \n\nTherefore, pretty much no company pays top level tax rates. So again, corporate taxes are kind of stupid because A - it is double taxation, B - you can and should just tax all income at the individual level, and C - no companies pay all these taxes anyway so it's just kind of stupid.\n\nComments welcome.",

It applies to any Japanese subsidiary in a low tax jurisdiction with a tax rate of 20% or less. Under this law, the Japanese parent is taxed on the undistributed earnings of these foreign subsidiaries. \n\nIn this way, Japanese companies cannot set up subsidiary companies to hold copyrights, patents, leases, etc, in tax haven countries that then lease these back to the parant company for a fee and thereby lower their taxable profits in Japan. \n\nJapan also has the concept of \"Economic Logic\" which is often used to deny special treatment to companies in tax havens. Under this concept, if the businesses could reasonably be carried on in Japan, the 'economic logic' of them being offshore is lacking, and is hence denied. \n\nThere are a few exceptions made. For example, where the subsidiary is in a country where the tax rate is more than 20%, the earnings can be excluded from current taxation only if: \n\n(i) the company has staff, assets, and premises to conduct the business, \n\n(ii) the management, control, and governance is carried out in that country, and \n\n(iii) the transactions with related parties are less than 50% of all transactions. \n\nThis approach effectively prohibits shell companies while allowing corporations to still set up legitimate businesses even in countries with lower corporate tax rates.\n\nJapanese multinational corporations are prevented quite effectively from the use of tax havens by having a very simple law which was first enacted in the late 70's. Yet Japanese companies are able to compete globally. China treats its multinational corporations in a similar way. \n\nSo why can't Europe and America?",

Companies like Apple would win out huge because they sell very high margin products, and they can do that because their products are pretty much always new and sought after by people willing to pay a premium.  Then on the other end of the spectrum is something like a paper company.  They may sell a lot of paper, but since no one is willing to pay much of a premium for any one brand of paper their margins are low.  Simplifying the tax code just opens more loopholes for companies to take advantage of.  It might work okay for the average person who has a simple job and a simple life from a financial standpoint, but shredding all the corporate tax laws in favor of some one size fits all measure would lead to way more tax avoidance.",

They care about how clean the streets are in Japan. They care about how healthy the food is in Japan. They care about buying Japanese and providing jobs to Japanese and keeping Japanese educated and making sure Japanese can get to work on time and that Japanese receive health care.\n\nThis mutual understanding extends to almost all Japanese people in Japan, who make returns on the expectations of one another, and thus avoid most kinds of criminal behavior, causing discomfort to each other in certain small ways, working harder for their companies. Some of it becomes absolutely inane, like refusing to take sick days or being willing to drink yourself half to death every night of the week and show up to work at 6 am the next day, or refusing to divorce your cheating spouse because of how your family would look in the eyes of others. It is an almost authoritarian culture, what North Korea would look like if it were less totalitarian and more liberal.\n\nJapanese also do not care for non-Japanese. It's not hatred, but it is a certain kind of weariness. Japanese know that Japanese understand the Japanese code--it's been perpetuated through an education system that is unified throughout the entire nation and established by a ministry run by an administration that has essentially been in power since the 1930s, if not the 1860s. But they don't know what non-Japanese do or do not know. They don't know what Korean or Chinese heritage Japanese know, or what new migrants know. You can become a citizen, only through proving extensive loyalty to the system by holding jobs for years and never having a run-in with the police.\n\nYou can have these extremely effective economic controls because there is a force much greater than profit driving these profit masters, and that is culture and cultural obligation.\n\nWestern executives mostly just want to make money.",

They also freely admit that they have an iphone, they just don't update it every year the way Apple would like them to.\n\nIf that's the minuscule level of outrage we're dealing with then any dreams of these huge corporations being humbled by us 'voting with our wallets' are doomed before they start.",
