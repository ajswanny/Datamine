Hopefully next election cycle we see some people who want to make some more ~~radical~~ dramatic changes for the good, and not some guy who makes simple and low risk changes to earn PR brownie points. \n\nI don't hate the guy and I voted for him, but he's definitely not my favourite pick for PM. He was just the safest pick. Harper was doing some weird stuff that should have been illegal but wasn't due to our Charter of Rights and Freedoms being vague about what supercedes it. \n\nAfterthoughts: I wrote radical because it's a powerful word. I chose it because what I think that needs to change requires ALOT of effort. Its not just political, its cultural. We as a society have this mentality that one's worth is directly tied to our career. While many other Western cultures define one's worth by how they enrich their community through their work, actions, and inactions. To me, our culture is fundamentally flawed in how we treat one another. \n\nA banker is respected, regardless of how terrible they are here. Even if they made money off of people literally losing their homes, they still get access to a VIP lifestyle and their voice is worth more than ours, because they have money. The greatest teachers in our lives go unappreciated by the larger culture, because they don't have these connections and cash. In fact, we complain about their benefits, wages and how they get summers off, yet the banker who took your house gets a \"Fuck that guy\" and then everyone just kind of forgets, in favour of attacking welfare recipients, firefighters, teachers, tradesmen, wearhouse workers, factory workers... \n\n I know this goes deeper, and I know that much of it has to do with the rich and connected, but we can't blame everything on the other. We are all responsible. Like I said, even our inactions can enrich or hurt our communities. So, I would like to see a PM who understands that. Who actually pushes for real change, and doesn't just ride the wave that was made by people who have sacrificed so much, many of whom will go unnamed and unknown to history. I voted for Trudeau because he wouldn't break the wave, but I'm not naive. He doesn't make waves, and I would like to see someone who can utilise the social changes we are seeing to their fullest, not just ride them out into a second term. But that's just me.

We'd need a president to sign off on it, which likely means 2021 at the earliest, and it's also likely that ISPs can't fuck over the internet as bad as our worst nightmares until *after* the 2020 elections.\n\nThe short of it: vote for dems in 2018, and encourage your friends to do the same. In the primaries, vote for as progressive and pro-net neutrality dems as you can. In 2020, we crush the GOP in both branches of government, and take back our internet.\n\nThe interim will be very scary, but we'll be okay for the couple years we'll need to make this happen.

If you spend too much time there you start to smell like dank basement and hardened cumsock.\n\nEdit: For those who don't know the story of the takeover of r/Canada, u/Jade_Shift sums it up nicely [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/7ebtma/comment/dq4t8gw):\n\n>The creator of the subreddit was an American who immediately grabbed a huge number of subreddit names when subreddits were created, hes an infamously inactive mod who is the top mod of a large number of subreddits. At some point he went completely MIA and the main mods are two /r/metacanada mods/posters, they later trimmed their accounts that mod /r/canada so that you can't see that they were /r/metacanada mods and changed the accounts that they mod /r/metacanada with to distance the two accounts, but at the time there were a number of posts on various subreddits outlining the situation.\n\n>/r/metacanada is a /r/the_donald type quasi troll subreddit that focuses heavily on hating muslims and similar stuff.\n\n>The moderators themselves say that they are simply overwhelmed with the amount of posting and that they try to act fairly, but in my and others experience they have a bias in terms of temp banning and removal, inflammatory, racist, xenophobic or otherwise extreme right wing comments are treated with less scrutiny than those who get into arguments with them.\n\n>While this went on the subreddits content became way way more focused on xenophobic/transphobic articles and things like that, posts about islam or immigration became very common, as well as posts that sparked tensions between west/east/french Canada. while the normal posts from the subreddit declined, in general articles were more inflammatory and less informative and there was a drop in overall light hearted content, some suggest this was do to intentional interference by mods in some way, I myself noticed that posting became more difficult, and there has also been a lot more botvoting in the new queue (instant downvoting on posts)\n\n>Trudeau hate became more common likely as a result of leftwing users of the subreddit leaving because they don't like what the sub had become. Not that I'm super happy with Trudeau's leadership so far, but he's certainly not the worst thing ever. He's treated basically how Harper used to be treated which is to say somewhat unfairly and I think that's indicitive of demographics shifts on the subreddit as leftwing users got sick of the content and/or got banned for getting in argument with metacanada trolls.\n\n>That's my take on it at any rate. I honestly believe that there is a targeted effort to create divisiveness going on in terms of the new queue, while I think the mods are just rightwing biased, and I'm not happy with what the subreddit shows of Canada, sometimes.\n\n>It may have improved since I haven't come here as much lately, and I only vaguely followed the situation.\n\n>E: Looking at the top of the sub right now: You have a beaverton article mocking Trudeau (fair enough), An article about an alliance of commonwealth countries to combat China from some site I've never heard of, an article on the strike, an article by a conservative politician about how universities are shutting down free speech, an article from rawstory about some idiot, a twitter post about this free speech argument, a bunch of divisive twitter stuff, an article about isis fighters in canada, an article about \"what quebecors say everyone else doesn't understand\", and an article about deportation.\n\n>Pretty divisive stuff, and while most of it is probably legitimate or valid in some respect, I don't really come to /r/canada to get a bunch of twitter politics and cultural war junk.\n\nAlso one of the mods alledgely put a bounty out to find dirt on a [reporter](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/wdbgbq/i-talked-to-the-person-who-put-a-bounty-out-on-me).",

    "body": "Net neutrality laws are regulation. By removing these laws, they are deregulating the internet in some capacity. It is an inch closer to unregulated capitalism.\n\nFor capitalism to have any semblance of working as it's marketed, regulation is required. However, the kind of regulation matters. Regulation in the form of protectionism of large companies removes the competition that people say capitalism provides on its own, but a lack of regulation to protect small businesses from the larger businesses doesn't help promote competition, as whoever has more resources will almost always being able to out-compete their given opponents.\n\nThis is the nature of capitalist competition. Whoever out-competes the other will continue on, as the other goes until they can't go further and they're run out of business, as is often the case. Examples of this include local sandwich shops going out of business by being undercut by a subway franchise that opens up nearby or locally-owned general stores being out-competed by bigger stores who can afford to take the loss for as long as is needed to eliminate the competition before hiking prices back up.\n\nAs this trend continues, it creates an oligopoly of companies which then need to be regulated as the majority of their viable competition has been run out of business due to the lack of market regulation protecting them. Failing to institute this new regulation has left large companies in a position to strong-arm any new competition out of the business while holding the market hostage, leaving them open to price-fixing with any competition that managed to survive to this point by getting on the same scale. \n\nThis doesn't even mention how businesses are known to use shitty tactics to drive down labour costs, such as unsafe working conditions, overwork, and the prevention of worker's unions from forming.\n\nThe problem isn't with regulation, it's with the wrong kind of regulation. Total deregulation is bad for consumers, workers, local businesses, and the competition that is so often touted as the ultimate saviour of free-market capitalism. Regulation is needed in the form of small-business protectionism, workers' rights protection, and steps to ensure that competition doesn't compete itself out of existence, as it almost always will tend toward.",

Company A is leading the market, but company B, while smaller, still has a strong client base.\n\nCompany A wants to buy out Company B, but Company B is not interested at all.\n\nOne of the top people in Company A has a relative that is also a business executive. That relative applies for a top position at Company B and gets it. After a few years, he manages to get himself promoted to a prominent position with a lot of influence over the company.\n\nCompany B trusts him, and he make decisions for the future of the company. The following few years is a string of bad to horrible decisions by this guy. At the time, people assume he's having bad luck, and just not doing his job right. Bad decisions costs Company B money, and clients. Stock prices drop, customer satisfaction drops, overall performance drops.. Company B slides in the market, and Company A comes back with another buyout offer, but this time much smaller than before.\n\nCompany B is in dire straits, in the red and in need of an influx of money to repair some of the bad decisions and move forward. They relent and sell to Company A for a bargain.\n\nCompany A lays most of company B off, sells off their equipment and buildings, and the relative that instigated it all, gets a nice cushy job back at Company A for a job well done.\n\nSo don't be surprised to find that Ajit has a cushy job sitting for him back at Verizon once he rapes net neutrality.\n",

This was despite guaranteeing they wouldn't do that as part of a winning bid on an airwaves auction.

So they have to decide \"do I just vote Liberal so that the Conservatives don't win?\" because they fear voting NDP, whom they support, would essentially be throwing their vote away since they don't think the NDP will win. So they vote Liberal, not to support Liberal, but to avoid Conservatives from gaining power.\n\nWith the weighted system, you can choose a second place candidate.... So in the above example, you can vote NDP, but if NDP doesn't get enough votes, you can have a 2nd place vote, Liberal, so your vote will count towards them.\n\nThis way, people would be more inclined to vote who they want, and by who they don't want in power.\n\nPoliticians here often say \"yes, we will look into that, we need change in how we vote\" and then shit all happens.\n",

At this point, I'm staying subbed for the content, and just simply try to stay away from the comments. If I'm looking for an honest conversation, or debate on a particular topic, I'll head to CanadaPolitics as I know it's - for the most part - evenly moderated by people across the political spectrum.\n\nOn another note: I take it you're from the peg? I lived in Dryden for years, so I've spent a lot of time there as I had friends who ended up at UofM, and my family traveled there a lot (and tbay) for medical reasons. Saw a guy take a dump in the middle of Polo Park when I was 17, followed by someone breaking into a car in the parking lot; this is on top of the sketchy shit I've seen helping friends move into res. Things better than I remember? \n\nEDIT: I should mention, seeing as you don't know my age, I haven't been to Winnipeg in ~15 years.",
