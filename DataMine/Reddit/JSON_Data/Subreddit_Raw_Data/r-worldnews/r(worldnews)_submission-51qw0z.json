They live in nice appartments, get occasional imports, their kids go to good schools and get a decent military post when they do their mandatory service, they have access to universities and live the closest thing to \"normal life\" in NK as we know it. A lot of them are smart enough that they should play along, but generally these are committed people because the alternative is losing everything they are barely holding on to as it is.\n\nThe remainder lives in feudal conditions, working as labor, sent to prison for insulting an officer, not hitting quotas, because your neighbor claimed you were an agitator... This population is just basically trying to survive under the physical presence of oppression in their community. While there is certainly an effort to control their minds, there are not nearly enough resources to actually brainwash this enormous population, so its handled through enforcement with extreme violence. The salt of the earth knows when its being pissed on and those people are not brainwashed - they are kept destitute and desperate. \n\nThe elite view the complaints and the events in the country side (the poor) as just more anti-revolutionary agitation, not worthy of attention, they literally see it as not a problem for their people, and that those being sent away to camps and prison as deserving of their punishment and lot. Not much different from how white america perceived the civil rights movement in the 60's in the USA\n",

Not saying that the DPRK is not a terrible country, but please people, do NOT believe things that come out of the US propaganda machine with no secondary source reporting on it. It is akin to believing things that come out of RT when no one else reports on it.   \nWhat you just said shows that the propaganda was effective, that's the whole point of it. If they get people into your mindset, they can claim literally anything without evidence and with no one else reporting on it, and unless you check where the news come from, you will believe it. They gradually spew out more and more abstract claims, and you go \"Huh, that seems weird, but I guess since it's North Korea, it must be true!! Anything can happen in North Korea, right?\".\n\nAnd again, I don't doubt there are unthinkable things going on in North Korea, but do not rely on literal state-owned propaganda outlets such as Radio Free Asia or RT to be your news source.",
