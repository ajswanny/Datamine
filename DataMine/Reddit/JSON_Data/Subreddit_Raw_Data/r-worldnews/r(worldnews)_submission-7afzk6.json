    "body": "The article really mentions the US's role in passing.  We're a world leader in natural resource production, so our presence is an example for other nations.  The corruption EITI is attempting to fight is based on the principle that a country's natural resources belong to the people of that country.  And some country's ( think Libya, Saudi Arabia, etc.) are using those resources to enrich the fortunate few running things.  This is not a problem in the US.  We may not agree on how the revenues are used, but they aren't going to building the Trumps and McConnells new yachts.\n\nThe bit about that being difficult to be transparent about for the US is true.  We have land owned by the federal government, states, private owners, and even Indian nations.  The revenue generated is split between royalties, severance taxes, etc. and then distributed back across thousands of funds between all those parties.  Keeping track, even getting access to the data, is hard - if not impossible.\n\nIn a lot of other countries the central government owns it all.\n\nI loathe this administration as much as anyone.  But using this to suggest more corruption in the US is untrue.  Using it as another example of us sacrificing our position as a model for the world to aspire to is completely valid.\n\nEdit:  My original comment may have been already too late, but here's some more info.  The Trump administration's effect on natural resources revenues did not come from disbanding USEITI.  It happened months ago by pulling back a new valuation rule.  It cost us millions.  Millions that you will find on the next set of financial statements released by the oil and gas companies with federal leases.",

    "body": "Here is my research for this topic since The Hill's research is just quoting another news agency..\n\n[DOI said its backing out because of legal reasons (last paragraph)](https://www.doi.gov/sites/doi.gov/files/uploads/eiti_withdraw.pdf)\n\n[EITI Chiar, Fredrik Reinfeldt, stated that the US backed out because of  \"The disapproval of the SEC Rules implementing the Dodd Frank provisions on the disclosure of payments by resource extraction issuers\"](https://eiti.org/news/eiti-chair-statement-on-united-states-withdrawal-from-eiti)\n\n[Here is the reason the SEC Rules were disapproved](http://dodd-frank.com/sec-proposes-new-resource-extraction-rule/)\n\n>\"The SEC has proposed Rule 13q-1 and an amendment to Form SD to implement Section 1504 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act relating to disclosure of payments by resource extraction issuers.  Rule 13q-1 was initially adopted by the SEC on August 22, 2012, but it was subsequently vacated by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia... Departing from usual practice, the proposed rule has a two-step comment process.  Initial comments are due on January 25, 2016. Reply comments, which may respond only to issues raised in the initial comment period, are due on February 16, 2016. In developing the final rules, the Commission may rely on both new comments and comments that have been received to date, including those that were provided in connection with the prior rules that the Commission issued under Section 13(q).\n\n>The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia vacated the original rule for two reasons. First, the SEC misread Section 13(q) to compel the public disclosure of the issuers\u2019 reports. Second, the Commission\u2019s explanation for not granting an exemption for when disclosure is prohibited by foreign governments was arbitrary and capricious.\n\n>As to the first point, The SEC states several factors support this approach. First, the statute requires the SEC to adopt rules that further the interests of international transparency promotion efforts, to the extent practicable. The SEC notes that several existing transparency regimes require public disclosure, including the identity of the issuer, without exception. A public disclosure requirement under Section 13(q) would further the U.S. foreign policy interest in supporting international transparency promotion efforts by enhancing comparability among companies, as it would increase the total number of companies that provide project-level public disclosure.\n\n>The SEC also believes it would also be consistent with the objective of ensuring that the United States is a global \u201cleader in creating a new standard for revenue transparency in the extractive industries.\u201d In addition, the United States is currently a candidate country under the EITI, which requires candidate countries to provide a framework for public, company-by-company disclosure in the EITI report. Permitting issuers to provide the required payment disclosure on a confidential basis could undermine the efforts of the USEITI to establish a voluntary payment disclosure regime for domestic operations. Moreover, the fact that issuers would be required by these other transparency promotion efforts to disclose publicly substantially the same payment information reduces the likelihood that the payment information would be confidential or that its disclosure would cause competitive harm.\n\n>The SEC also believes that neither the statute\u2019s text nor legislative history includes any suggestion that the required payment disclosure should be confidential. In fact, the SEC believes the legislative history supports its view that the information submitted under the statute should be publicly disclosed.\n\n>With respect to the second point, the SEC states it will consider using its existing authority under the Exchange Act to provide exemptive relief at the request of a resource extraction issuer, if and when warranted.  The SEC believes that a case-by-case approach to exemptive relief using its existing authority is preferable to either adopting a blanket exemption for a foreign law prohibition (or for any other reason) or providing no exemptions and no avenue for exemptive relief under this or other circumstances.  Among other things, such an approach would permit the SEC to tailor the exemptive relief to the particular facts and circumstances presented such as by permitting alternative disclosure or by phasing out the exemption over an appropriate period of time.\"",

I understand drawing attention to issues that are important to you and decisions you don't agree with, but the wording doesn't do anything to help the sense of divide in this country. Everyone knows who us making the decisions. If people would be less aggressive with explanations you would probably gain more traction. \n\nTrump supporters will read the title and immediately label you an enemy regardless of the decision. Anti Trump crowd will support you, but those aren't the people you need. You need the former. \n\nTl;dr: obvious finger pointing, whether accurate or not, widens the uncreasingly present political divide in the United States and i think it's because people keep flocking (read: bitching) to people who hold the same viewpoints when the target audience should be people who hold the opposite viewpoints. If you leave out your political stance while presenting your view on an issue you may be more successful in winning people over. ",

So eliminating the Estate Tax is eliminating a tax that affects only the wealthiest of Americans\n\nThis and other reductions are expected to cost $1.5 *trillion* in 10 years. How will that money be made up? With measures like:\n\n# Elimination of the Student Loan Interest Deduction\n\nCurrently those with student loans can deduct up to $2500 from their taxes from the accumulated interest of the loans. The new GOP tax plan will eliminate that deduction.\n\nTake from the young and poor, give to the rich. Reverse Robin Hood but with the power of the law.\n\n**Edit:** There's one guy saying that 99% of Americans will see their taxes cut. While the plan does aim to slash taxes across the board, you need to remember that money doesn't appear out of nothing. If every American is paying less in taxes then how will the government function? Federal operations won't suddenly operate more efficiently due to a tax plan and loss of funding. Someone has to foot the bill, and with the above as examples it's pretty clear who the GOP intends it to be.\n\n**Edit 2:** From [BusinessInsider](http://www.businessinsider.com/trump-gop-tax-reform-plan-bill-text-details-rate-2017-10):\n\n# Corporate tax cut will be immediate and permanent. The cut to 20% from the current 35% will is designed to be permanent.\n\n**Edit 3:** The main point being used to say that the new plans saves people money is from the new deduction. Here's the analysis from BusinessInsider:\n\nA larger standard deduction. To avoid raising taxes on those currently in the 10% tax bracket, the standard deduction for all taxes would increase to $12,000 for individuals (up from $6,350) and $24,000 for married couples (up from $12,700). These are slightly less than the doubled deductions expected \u2014 and, as **Business Insider's Josh Barro has written, the idea that this would save people money may be misleading since it eliminates other personal deductions and a secondary standard deduction.**\n\n**Edit 4:** Those are the big points that have been pulled out of the new plan. **Keep in mind the plan was only released hours ago**. Many people are analyzing and figuring the outcomes of the 429 page plan; be skeptical of anyone telling you the effect it will have with absolute certainty.",

The pushback to this anti-corruption effort is that it puts our oil and gas companies at a disadvantage by forcing them to disclose key details of their dealings. So, for example, if Shell had done some exploration on their own dime and found out that Eritrea had a good chance of having a decent amount of oil they'd want to start interfacing with the Eritrean government to get the proper permits for exploratory drilling. Even if this was all done above board, it would still require Shell to make some payments to the Eritrean government. Without the anti-corruption laws in place, Shell could keep all of these payments proprietary and hush hush until they're ready to actually break ground. *With* the anti-corruption laws in place, the moment they make any kind of payment to Eritrea the whole world knows about it, and now you've got a rush to get to the oil that Shell paid to find out of its own pocket. This puts American companies at a competitive disadvantage when other countries don't force their oil and gas companies to be held to the same high standard.\n\nNow, people may differ on whether or not the problem of corruption in oil and gas is severe enough to warrant such restrictions, regardless of the market consequences, but it's not as though this anti-corruption policy has no negative consequences. Sec. Tillerson and his colleagues may very well be enriching themselves by pulling out of the deal. It is also possible that this is a net positive decision made by the administration and serves U.S. national interests, regardless of the benefits experienced by those who are making the decisions.",

Sometimes barely veiled in code or allusions other times outright. It is sincerely depressing. \n  \nTwo things I noted: I tried reporting some of the posts as hate speech.... I did about 7 today. Clear cut cases. I'm talking talking \"Kushner needing to be rid of because he's The Vile Jew in the Christian White House\" kind of stuff. Every single time I was rejected. Facebook is protecting hate speech. It's ridiculous. Don't take my word for it, try for yourself.      \n  \n[Here's one I did today.

Operating on a level we little fathom. Like they are totally right underneath us.  \n  \nAgain, please, don't take my word for it, go look.

    "body": "This can't be repeated enough! Trump is a prime example of how short term the United States of America's memory is and it's absolutely terrifying. Throughout my entire life of the 80s 90s and early 2000s Trump was hated by almost everyone, and I do mean just about universally everyone.\n\nUp until The Apprentice start airing he was one of the few celebrities to ever live that had zero fan club members. Absolutely nobody liked him and he was a symbol of all things corrupt and evil. In the eighties and nineties you could have walked down every major street, in every major city in this country and you would have been hard-pressed to find one single person on the street that actually liked him and I doubt you would have found a single person that believed he could be a good president... And yes the topic of presidency came up in the eighties and nineties because this arrogant fucker always loved to toot his own horn and talk about how \"easily* he could accomplish seemingly impossible tasks while simultaneously bankrupting nearly every company he touch and refusing to pay the majority of contractors that have ever worked with him, the few that did get paid either didn't get the correct amount or were paid late it almost didn't matter.\n\nAnd that's just the stuff that was in the limelight, we've got tons of, investigation worthy evidence that behind the scenes he was even more of a coward and ila straight up sex offender, and even allegedly a rapist.\n\nAnd we elected the muther fucker I just described as president of United States of America!!! jfc what has happened to this country that we have fallen so very far. I would take take just about any Republican in our borders to be president, effective tomorrow, if that's what it took to get this son-of-a-bitch out of the office... and I honestly believe that, no matter who was chosen, we would all sleep better tomorrow night, the majority of Republican citizens included.\n\nIt's amazing how quickly people forget, or just completely change their minds on something, something that has been synonymous with absolute bullshit for decades to now being loved and followed by a very large chunk of America.\n\nEvery last one of us should be ashamed and every last one of us is at least a little bit to blame.  Our parents and ourselves helped steer this country in a direction were any of this was even a possibility in the first place. We all backed ourselves into a corner where during the 2016 election cycle our only two choices in November were Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton... and every last one of us allowed that to happen over many decades of complacency in allowing corruption and bipartisanship to spread through this country like a plague . To the point were we're getting close to throwing 150 years down the drain. We're not far from repeating the mistakes of 1865 all over again, except for this time with a whole lot more people, technology, and seething hatred for one another, hatred that just continues to grow every single day we don't do something to change it and hold our government accountable for all of their collective actions, no matter which side of the aisle they rest their corrupt asses on.\n\nAbsolutely shameful.",

But don't forget that other administrations literally sponsored coups or invaded countries because of business interests. \n\nThe Eisenhower administration for example sponsored a coup in Guatemala because of business interests. In the place of democratically elected Jacobo \u00c1rbenz, the US installed a fascist dictator, Carlos Castillo Armas.   \nWhy? United Fruit was granted an exemption from all taxes by previous dictators (which were supported by various US administrations), and owned 550,000 acres of Guatemalan farmland, up to 85% of which was left permanently idle to keep fruit prices high and Guatemalans poor. \u00c1rbenz planned to redistribute the land that was left permanently idle and to end the tax exemptions, which of course, United Fruit did not like. Luckily for United Fruit, the Eisenhower administration had many influential figures that had ties to United Fruit, such as then-Secretary of State Foster Dulles and then-CIA director Allen Dulles. \n\nAfter Carlos Castillo was installed, the CIA also gave him a list of ~70,000 \"questionable individuals\", which mostly consisted of teachers, doctors, union organisers, etc. who were vocal about supporting \u00c1rbenz and democracy in Guatemala over the fascism that Castillo brought. Many of them were tortured and killed.",

The Soviets never got the traction among the radical left back in the 70s and 80s, but Russia has found fertile ground in the American Right to implement the tactic. There is good chance the entire Alt-Right movement was astroturfed over the last decade by the Russians.",

They're ignorant - my mother has an excuse that she was from rural Poland, but my Dad is an idiot who prides himself on being an idiot.\n\nWhen Trump ran, he ran as an 'idiot that prides himself on being an idiot' and 'sticking his finger to the elite' (elite is not the same 'elite' that liberals consider as the elite - elite refers to political correctness, what is general regarded as good, wise behavior, and in general, a belief in expertise, science, and intelligence).\n\nI think it's important to realize that both sentiments are deeply 'conservative' and run across almost all countries and education lines.  \n\nStop interacting with people who can write cohesive paragraphs and who have a general knowledge about recent history - and you'll soon understand that most people in the United States have little working education and retention of facts.  And they have to survive by adopting different strategies about what is actually 'true' or 'fake' and what is 'important' and what is an 'elite' and who is a 'blowhard'.  \n\nI'll give you a hint, most of those presuppose initial facts and reason.  What happens when you take away facts and reason - especially a respect for these ideas and ideals?  What do those words become?  \n\nThey're not meaningless.  They are different, it's like calling someone an idiot when you're a child for not knowing how to play with a toy.  What does a child mean when he calls another child an idiot in this regard?  \n\nThis is why we have Trump - too many adult children.  Their understanding of what is happening or what is said in politics is very different than what the educated and higher IQ understand is happening.  \n\nIt's not just 'memory' - my parents don't really remember what happened last year because they don't want to use their brain.  It's just hard for them to think and recall.  And it's always been this way.  It's not an age thing.  It's a brain thing.  They use a different strategy to live and process the world - one that is supremely childish.  \n\nEducation as an exercise of the rational and critical thinking is very important to the development of a person.  The humanities as well.  \n\nMy father is a doctor, but he's the most ignorant fucking person in the room.  My mother says his general education stopped when he was in 4th grade - and I can believe it.  After that, he was just working or in a specialized courses for passing the tests.\n\nI met many people like my father.  Absolutely, supremely ignorant, but successful.  He's not able to construct his thoughts in a logical way or even put them together cohesively.  He gets angry when you show him he doesn't make sense.  It's similar to exactly when I was going door to door.  Show people they are wrong - and they'll get childishly angry and double down against you based on nothing but their feelings.  We have a whole nation like this.\n\nChildish bullying and insults is on their level.  Trump is America.  100%.  Trump is also Russia, Europe, and China - in the Rural parts.",

Those things that matter most from an imperialist perspective actually do not seem to change much from administration to administration (this article e.g. gives many examples: https://chomsky.info/20080424/). And Trump himself seems to be in favor of such actions as well, as evidenced for example by him asking why the USA does not just take all the resources etc that exist in Afghanistan right now (he said something along those lines when he was still campaigning). Notice also that many members of his administration seem to have the kind of mentality you would have expected from those robber barons of old, and there is no doubt in my mind that those who have no issues with ruining their home country in the name of profit will not hesitate for even a second to do the same to other countries if the opportunity happens to present itself to them.",

Once the Soviets had retreated from the country, the US stopped caring and let the extremists loose to do whatever. They later toppled the government and seized the country for themselves.

Instead of legitimizing these ignorant views by giving them a powerful voice through politicians, let their fantasy land be torn to shreds in the Colosseum of debate. \n\nIn ancient Athenian democracy all citizens had the right to speak in assembly with the right of *insegora*. Not everyone spoke in the assembly, and in doing so relinquished their power to professional rhetors, the Sophists. Why did people not speak despite the inherent responsibility one has to democracy should they wish to benefit from it? Could be many reasons: stage fright, fear of punishment, time it takes to get to the assembly, time and energy needed to sit through everyone's speech, lack of education, etc.\n\nBut what if the Athenians had utilized mask to create an anonymous or pseudonymous environment? What if the Athenians utilized a by mail system so one need not travel, and could read in one's own time? Could these changes to the orientation of democracy effect the level of individual interaction? Would this level of individual interaction effect the amount of power the individuals relinquished to the Sophists?\n\n**TL;DR:** The internet is a huge change to our communication capabilities, we need to look at this change critically to understand what checks and balances it can provide.",

Foundationless faith\n\nThis has been happening in India for the last several years with Modi supporters. \n\nWe call them bhakts - devotees willing to sacrifice anything for their leader. The first offering was logic. Then it was their empathy. The last and ongoing one is their humanity. As a section of the voting public, they no longer care for Muslim rights, Untouchable rights, or refugee rights. Ironically, on the last count, they repeat what European far-righters say about refugees.\n\nIt's one of the most horrifying things I've seen happen to my country. I see no difference in the way Trump supporters do things - in fact, it's almost like a play by play of how Modi's online fan club does things. Which itself, was a play on how Putins online fan club did things - which drew upon Soviet propaganda techniques. The Russians invented whataboutism; now seen in the shrieking of 'HER EMAILS' in order to derail any other critique of the supreme leader. The entire world is undergoing nationalized variants of stupid personality cults. \n\nIt looks like the American media/people are catching up to their lies faster than we did.\n",

The introduction of any other sort of barrier (e.g. a political aptitude test in which the voter must prove knowledge of candidates and issues) has and will always be met with extreme opposition and likely never pass (direct counter to the previous example: \"ok but who makes the questions and answers?\").\n\n> The internet is a huge change to our communication capabilities, we need to look at this change critically to understand what checks and balances it can provide.\n\nThe internet showed its hand in the most recent election. People are more connected than ever but many are further reclused into their preferred spaces. Literal fake news spread like wildfire while legitimate stories were labeled as fake. A foreign power spent enormous effort to push these stories to undermine the election. (Note to anyone about to attack the previous statement: this is not about the collusion with Russia--that's still under investigation. It *is* known that many of the fabricated news stories critical of Clinton and Democrats originated in Russia, as well as some Macedonian teens cashing in on the ad revenue.)\n\nIf the last election showed anything of the internet, it's that it is not a check nor balance for a democracy. Rather it is a powerful tool for those who wish to undermine the democracy. It is a pervasive force with power proportional to the ability of the people to see through it. Those who recognize a fabricated event or headline are affected minimally; those who cannot spot a fake article or choose not to by affiliation yield themselves to its power.\n\nThe internet is a check on democracy in the same way that a virus is a check on an organism. The cells that spot the virus for what it is can avoid it, the cells that can't will spread the virus and possibly kill the host (excuse the over-simplified biology). Now obviously in this scenario there is a need for a vaccine and much the same we have a \"vaccine\" in the form of education (a few elementary schools around the world are starting to teach these skills). But then the problem rears its ugly head that the people who revile real vaccines will also take issue with this \"vaccine\"...\n\nThe internet could certainly be a wonderful tool to allow more open discussion of issues in a truly open forum, but as mentioned already, many people will shy away from areas where their beliefs are questioned and it's difficult to ensure that only those who desire the strength and progress of the democracy are taking part.\n\n**tl;dr:** The internet is a truly open place where anyone can impact a discussion, even those who wish only to undermine its cause. Add to that the fact that many people have surrounded themselves in their echoes and a real forum for democracy is impossible on the internet as we know it today. The people will not come to face questions of themselves and it is difficult to be certain of the origins of those that do.",

Completely neglecting the fact that he resigned because an impeachment *and conviction* was a near certainty. He'll then go on to speculate about the corruption of the Clintons because \"How he was able to stay in office after he was impeached, I don't know.\" He still hasn't grasped the concept that an impeachment is not a proof of guilt nor a removal from office, but essentially a vote to hold a trial. It isn't the trial itself, and it isn't any convictions or sentencing that the trial might produce.",

Conservatism is defined as \"support for the status quo,\" (i.e. opposition to change) and reactionism as \"support for the status quo ante\" (i.e. supporting reversal of change), which are the origins of the right. On the other hand, the left is generally supportive of change, but the *form* of that change varies from movement to movement.\n\nThis means that the left is defined by policies and movements, while historically the right is simply defined as a resistance towards those policies and movements. Nowadays there are forces on the right that *do* seek specific changes, such as right-libertarianism and fascism, but the mainstream right hasn't really changed in its goals since the origins of left-right terminology in the French Revolution.\n\nTLDR: The left is about action; the right is about reaction.\n\n---\n> The Left on the other hand has historically not been nearly as hateful of the Right until recently\n\nI'm going to dispute that - left-wing movements have definitely done some pretty hateful things, even since the French Revolution when they were guillotining heads off.
