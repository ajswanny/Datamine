That will give them higher quality coal and more control over the coal source.Plus they will guarantee the Chinese company a steady coal production and hence increase Chinese foreign assets. \n\nchina also wants to reduce pollution hence the reason behind using higher quality coal. they also want to go renewable in the future.

The ROK rented a 15 ft diameter drill machine from Germany, and started their own tunnel, heading to where they thought the DPRK tunnel was. They ended up hitting it dead on. The DPRK tunnel, which we got to go in, was obviously dug by hand with crude tools, and you couldn't really stand up in it. The ROK had built a little train track to take you closer to the DMZ (but it still didn't go into the DPRK, that had been closed off). Man, that was insanely claustrophobic, even with adequate lighting.\n\nAnyway, the DPRK has nothing. Anything they get goes to Lil Kim and the generals. What a pathetic country.

North Korea could then be economically revived and opened up the world, allowing it to recover and its population to have a fair shot at life.\n\nThere is no reason why North and South Korea cannot remain independent countries for the time being, except restore communications links and allow civilian travel between the two.\n\nReunification can happen when both sides are ready.  If the North recovers and rebuilds on its own before that happens, then it wouldn't be such a financial hit for the South.  Everyone's happy.",

Having lived there, they could really rethink their plumbing. It's flexible line for almost everything. Like why bother cutting pipe to fit and getting the angles right? Just throw some flexible line on there and if it doesn't drain right, just buy some drain cleaner and jiggle it. And if there's a plumbing problem in the building, make sure to blame the foreigners, especially the new arrivals. The have this funny western notion that you should be able to flush your toilet paper without consequence.
