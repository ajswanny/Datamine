Also, our aristocracy has wanted to cannibalize the middle class, commandeer the government and broadly deregulate everything in the economy for decades and they've been succeeding.  \n   \nReminder: American Conservatism is literally a plot to bring back the Gilded Age.  \n  \n>**On August 23, 1971, prior to accepting Nixon's nomination to the Supreme Court, Powell was commissioned by his neighbor, Eugene B. Sydnor Jr., a close friend and education director of the US Chamber of Commerce, to write a confidential memorandum titled \"Attack on the American Free Enterprise System,\" an anti-Communist, anti-New Deal blueprint for conservative business interests to retake America** for the chamber.[13][14] It was based in part on Powell's reaction to the work of activist Ralph Nader, whose 1965 expos\u00e9 on General Motors, \"Unsafe at Any Speed,\" put a focus on the auto industry putting profit ahead of safety, which triggered the American consumer movement. Powell saw it as an undermining of Americans' faith in enterprise and another step in the slippery slope of socialism. [...]\n>\n>The memo called for corporate America to become more aggressive in molding society's thinking about business, government, politics and law in the US. **It sparked wealthy heirs of earlier American Industrialists [...] to use their private charitable foundations, [...] to fund Powell's vision of a pro-business, anti-socialist, minimalist government-regulated America as it had been in the heyday of early American industrialism**, before the Great Depression and the rise of Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal.\n>\n>**The Powell Memorandum thus became the blueprint of the rise of the American conservative movement and the formation of a network of influential right-wing think tanks and lobbying organizations, such as The Heritage Foundation and the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) as well as inspiring the US Chamber of Commerce to become far more politically active.**[15][16] \n  \nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_F._Powell_Jr.#Powell_Memorandum   \n  \nFor the international audience, think-tanks and lobbying groups like the Heritage Foundation and ALEC are the institutional core of conservative policy and legislation.  \n  \nAnd the Gilded Age preceded the great depression.  It was free wheeling Laissez Faire capitalism. Dirty water, impure drugs, unsafe food, 14 hour work days, child labor, retiree beggars all over every city, extreme inequality, extreme political corruption, etc.  \n   \nThere's hundreds of billions of dollars worth of assholes who think Medicare, public education, income taxes, etc. were all mistakes in dire need of correction. And they have spent billions of dollars over recent decades to make it happen. And you know what? They're succeeding.  \n  \nA little money every year on buying politicians, buying media, buying economics departments, propping up thinking tanks, propping lobbying groups and a little patience is all it takes.  And for their efforts?  They have an anti-government Republican party, a weak opposition party and a proto-fascist in the presidency.  \n  \nThis is the long arc of our history and it will only get worse.  ",

Also President Obama ratified the agreement, not the senate (apparently the Paris Agreement isn't legally binding so it doesn't require the senates approval, this also means Trump is legally free to withdraw at anytime?

For most people, climate change isn't as big of a concern as other issues.    If you are 65-year-old person in the midwest that likes to hunt and believes abortion is murdering babies, voting for a candidate that's pro-choice and anti-gun might be more repulsive than voting for somebody that doesn't want to help people in coastal areas be displaced 10 years after your dead.   However, if given a choose to vote for a pro-gun, anti-abortion, spend money on climate change candidate, they would.  It's an inherent flaw in the US's representational democracy and the inevitable two party system that emerged.   To some degree, almost everybody is voting for somebody that supports issues they don't agree with.  There is a curious human need to resolve cognitive dissonance.  The result of this is that people will often justify their support of a candidate by changing their views on issues they don't support.   So, if you poll people after they choose a candidate that they disagreed with on an issue their views on that issue sometimes changes to match the candidates.     If Americans could vote on every issue, rather than representatives to vote for them, I am almost certain the US would strongly support spending money to deal with climate change.",

Jimmy Carter goes next at 77-81, we see another oil shortage (one happened for Nixon too), support in nuclear energy and other non fossil fuels. I think we can both agree Reagan (81-89), for better or worse, influenced America greatly. From Reaganomics that some still follow to the letter, to \"Mr gorbachev, tear down this wall!\" GHWB saw the gulf war, our first real \"thing\" in the middle East that wasn't a proxy. Bill Clinton (93-01) got the leaders of Israel and Egypt to shake hands! How crazy is that? Then he got impeached by the house because he got his dick sucked and lied about it. Somehow thats just as crazy! That precedent is probably why people are so impeachment happy today, on both sides of the political fence. Then GWB comes in and starts 2 wars which, justified or not, are probably gonna have a good page or two in the history books. Obama was the first black president which is crazy since there were still laws against interracial marriage on the books at the time. And then trump in a good am tv personality who made it into office. Not the first time (looking at you Reagan), but certainly the most controversial. That's all not really counting stuff like the cold war, the moon landing, or the electoral college controversy. It's no great depression followed a by WW2, but  I this past 50 years have been pretty crazy.\n\nThis was all written on my phone so my bad if I typoed  ",

I wouldn't be surprised if he started relying more heavily on Bush Sr. to do the heavy lifting towards the end of his second term, but at least he retained his ability to speak lucidly.

    "body": "In the interest of not embarking on a massive train of discussion, I'll give one quick example. This is purely anecdotal; I am not trying to get into the detail of policy or anything here but having lived in both settings, this is one particular thing that comes to mind: the jobs--particularly, those that are willing to do them.\n\nThe jobs are entirely different. In a city, you go to McDonald's or SuperAmerica or anything like that and you have adults working and (presumably) trying to support themselves or a family with that job. In rural areas those positions are *entirely* staffed by high schoolers. I live in the middle of a city now and it seems so odd to me that there are no teenagers working anywhere. \n\nBack in my hometown, maybe 15-20% (totally pulled that out of my ass) of the people that leave for college ever come back. The white-collar administrative positions (business owners, staff at the two banks in town, one accounting firm, etc) are almost entirely middle age and older individuals. There is not much of a millennial voice in these communities--they only hear \"our\" points of view from teenagers, basically.\n\nI guess the takeaway to briefly apply to a current political issue--it is easy to see why rural (generally conservative) areas are vehemently against minimum wage increases. To them, the obvious question that arises is why the hell would we legislate a $15 minimum wage for a 16-year-old that rings up my gas? It just doesn't make sense to the voting-age individuals in those areas and frankly, it's quite understandable.",

    "body": "Not a complete answer by any means, but if you live out in the sticks, public utilities are extremely limited. Usually it's only electricity and TV, maybe gas. Water is up to you, so you have to have your own well dug and maintained, same with sewer. Internet is by satellite, if you can get it in your area. Groceries aren't something you pop over to the store for every other day, but rather you bring back a big haul every week or two, sometimes longer, because it's a couple hours each way. Unless, of course, you just grow and raise it yourself. \n\nRoads aren't typically maintained as well, and the nearest freeway is usually a ways off, as are other public amenities typically found in more urban areas. Public transportation is non-existent. This means that many of the benefits that are funded by taxes are largely unseen by rural communities, hence the strong anti-tax sentiment. It's not only that they don't personally benefits from tax funded programs, but are unlikely to know or even encounter someone who does.",

I've got my family and one close friend still living there but that's about it. I've forgotten names and faces and many people have forgotten mine.
