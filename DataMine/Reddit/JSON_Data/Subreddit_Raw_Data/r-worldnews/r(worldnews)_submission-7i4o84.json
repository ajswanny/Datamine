Marriage equality is just one aspect of LGBT discrimination that must be rectified, on top of the culture war that still ought be fought for gay acceptance. Same deal here in the US, homophobia is still widespread despite us making gay marriage legal in 2015.\n\nCongrats and good luck Australians.",

That doesn't actually tell you whether the people *want* a new flag, only that if they were to have a new one, this is the one that is most popular.\n\nSimilarly a vote for just \"should we have a new flag\" (before deciding on one) might get a big yes vote, but none of the yes-voters agree on what the new flag should be.\n\nThat seems like the only way to establish that there is a new flag that people actually want (or would at least be happy with) over the current one.\n\nWhich is not to say that the entire thing wasn't a massive waste of everybody's time and money, I think that's a given.",

    "body": "You're in the pub, having a drink with a couple mates. One of them goes outside for a smoke and the other goes for a slash, so you're left alone for a couple minutes. A guy comes out of nowhere and sits at the bar. He's a little intoxicated, and a bit off (is it drugs? Mental illness? Unclear).\n\nThe guy clearly doesn't respect normal boundaries; he sits down across from you and starts talking. By the time your mates are back you've heard his life story, how he has 2 kids down the coast that their mother doesn't let him see but he's been trying real hard to get a job so he might get to soon.\n\nHe tells you his theories about the government, how they're all out to get him and about how centrelink really fucked him over. As your friends return he pulls out some cards, does a couple magic tricks, and asks you to buy him a beer.\n\nThat's Bob Katter.",
