The Shafi'i school of jurisprudence has a long tradition among the Chechens, and thus it remains the most practiced.\n\nSource: \n\n- Mairbek Vatchagaev (September 8, 2006). \"The Kremlin's War on Islamic Education in the North Caucasus\".

The Prophet turned out such-and-such man, and 'Umar turned out such-and-such woman.\" \n\n> al-Tirmidhi, Sunan 1:152 - [Muhammad said] \"Whoever is found conducting himself in the manner of the people of Lot, kill the doer and the receiver.\" \n\n> Reliance of the Traveller, p17.2 - \"May Allah curse him who does what Lot's people did.\" \n\n> Quran (7:80-84) - \"...For ye practice your lusts on men in preference to women: ye are indeed a people transgressing beyond bounds.... And we rained down on them a shower (of brimstone)\" - \n\n> Ayatollah Abdollah Javadi-Amoli of Iran said, in April of 2012, that homosexuals are inferior to dogs and pigs, since these animals (presumably) do not engage in such acts. In November of that year, a cleric on British television stated, \"What should be done to those who practice homosexuality? Torture them; punish them; beat them and give them mental torture.\" \n\n> A 2014 fatwa from the mainstream OnIslam.net proclaimed that homosexuality is \"abnormal\" and abhorrent\" and confirmed that gays should be killed: \"The punishment for men or women who are unwilling to give up homosexuality and therefore are rejecting the guidance of Allah Most High is in fact death according to Islam.\"  An imam invited to speak at a Florida mosque in 2016 said that killing gays was an \"act of compassion\".\n\n> Since the resurrection of the caliphate in 2014 (the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria) dozens of homosexuals have been thrown from rooftops.  Other have been stoned to death.  Muslim identity groups, such as CAIR, did not bother to issue a single denunciation of these serial murders prior to the 2016 Islamist massacre at a gay night club in Orlando.",

First and foremost I want to say this: I'm from Russia and I just recently finished my service as a conscript in a certain spetsnaz unit which I won't name but I'll say specializes in internal anti-terror affairs, e.g. gets stationed in North Caucasus. Now, you might know that Russia holds the V-day parade every year since WW2 and my unit's division partakes in it every year since then as well. Now, the only year when our division wasn't on the parade was in 1995 when the Chechen war broke out. Seeing as how conflicts within our borders is my division's (and branch's) modus operandi, it was deployed to Chechnya in its entirety. That's 13000 men, or rather, boys. 30% came back (wikipedia casualties is bs; we really fucked up in that war). Now this guy (in the picture), this \"hero\" of Russia (he even has the fucking star, the highest honor in our military, smfh) was part of the Chechen command and is personally responsible for deaths, decapitations, other mutilations, torture of thousands of Russian conscripts; young boys like you or your little brother, person who is reading this (think about it for a second, then google pictures of what chechens did to russians during the war). Then, when the time was right, he took part in the assassination of his father, the Chechen leader at the time, and replaced him as the now head of state, our president's puppet. \nI ask you this: what would you expect from this person and his mob? I'm not even asking you how is it possible that this person has a medal only a handful of our bravest boys got in the war, or how hypocritical and inhumane to our own people it is that this person is ruling and living lavishly with his atrocities well known to everyone.",

So once the British overran the Oranje Free State and the South African Republic (aka Transvaal) in the conventional sense, they then faced a brutal guerrilla campaign from a bunch of pissed off Boers where friggin' marksmanship was one of the single most popular past times.\n\nSo the British decided instead started rounding up the families, the elderly and women and children, and throwing them into camps to suffer and die in order to force the Boer forces to surrender.  By the time the Boers finally surrendered, 26,000+ Boer women and children had died in concentration camps, along with at least another 20,000+ black Africans.  Unfortunately, the number of Africans interred isn't as well documented (though from what I understand, the state of the camps they were kept in were often far, far shittier).\n\nSo hey, thanks Britain!

It seems like a lot of the societies that have such extreme attitudes about even deeply closeted gay men are nations that have other reasons to feel \"emasculated.\" I'm not trying to get into \"haha fragile male egos\" or anything, I just get the impression that when people in power have a chip on their shoulders after a fall from influence or cultural relevance, \"weak\" or effeminate men suddenly seem like a target. \n\nMen in many parts of Russia have some very real problems. Rates of alcoholism, unemployment, and significantly lower life expectancy than Russian women, etc. can put people in a very nasty mindset. The traditional Russian male is having a rough go of it right now, maybe carrying on as though gay men and the stereotypes that are attributed to them *don't even exist* is a symptom of that. I think it's also why queer men get the brunt of it while queer women seem to be discussed less. Maybe cultures in some kind of crisis just can't handle deviation from \"strong\" masculinity. I don't know. I think of it like a very large-scale version of how confident, well-adjusted straight men can generally laugh it off if a gay man maybe reads him wrong, but a guy less secure in his sexuality or \"dude-ness\" might freak the fuck out.",

Many of them are very young, just teenagers.  I feel sick thinking about it.  \n\nEDIT:  What I would like to see happen is the State Dept. try to negotiate the release of these people.  Their government will obviously never admit it is happening publicly, but we might be able to secure their release behind the scenes.  That is my hope.  I just want them out of there and safe.",

There's an interesting discussion that can be had here about sexism repressing men's outward displays of affection towards each other (sometimes to the point of disallowing displays of emotion which can cause vast amounts of frustration due to being unable to express oneself in a healthy manner) and men that wear even remotely flamboyant or feminine clothing to be jeered, mocked, or worse.

The 1954 reform of the 1933 \"Ley de vagos y maleantes\" (\"Vagrancy Act\")[3] declared homosexuality illegal, equating it with procuring. The text of the law declares that the measures in it \"are not proper punishments, but mere security measures, set with a doubly preventive end, with the purpose of collective guarantee and the aspiration of correcting those subjects fallen to the lowest levels of morality. This law is not intended to punish, but to correct and reform\". However, the way the law was applied was clearly punitive and arbitrary: police would often use the Vagrancy laws against suspected political dissenters, using their homosexuality as a way to go around the judicial guarantees.\n\nThey didn't even lose their charges [until 2001.](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/dec/13/gayrights.gilestremlett)",

We do have civil unions that are almost equivalent to marriages, but they are a) **only** for homosexual couples[1] and b) a civil union couple can not adopt children as a couple. One spouse will be the sole adopter. Which is BS.

The original civil union - without the amendments the constitutional court forced - was pretty neat for people sorta wanting a commitment without the whole deal of a marriage.

And now it's just a stupid label to keep backwards politicians happy and creates unnecessary seperation and hurdles for folks. And of course straight couples did not benefit from it either.)",

For example sometimes the groups are divided along gender lines for the scope of a particular argument (i.e. roles in military, women's suffrage movements, ecclesiastical leadership, etc. etc.), sometimes the groups are divided along nationality, fandom, ethnicity, color, economic background, etc.  The only point I am making is that the type of group we feel like we are a part of can shift and change depending on the conversation being had and the issue being discussed because we are embedded in layers of overlapping groups.\n\nSo... somebody might be my hated other in *one* context, but be my brethren against some other group in *another.*  It doesn't require much creativity to contrive specific examples of this so I won't labor this comment by taking the time to invent and type some examples.  \n\nGiven the above point, perhaps some hypothetical (possible or otherwise) solution or near solution could be proposed in these terms.  This would manifest by either: \n\n1) Introducing a context by which humans would perceive themselves to be in the same group.  e.g. The song \"We are the World\" seeks to create this perception in the listener's mind.  \n\n2) Introducing some reality by which humans would actually *be* in the same group vs. some other.  e.g. An existential threat like an asteroid or alien invasion.  \n\nThis idea of group identity and it's role on our psychology and society was a central theme to The Watchmen by Alan Moore.  The antagonist of that book seeks to hack human behavior by exploiting the very features you are describing.  He uses a combination of 1) and 2) above to try to elevate our society by creating a context wherein we would perceive ourselves to be a single group set apart from another because he saw that deep down we *need* that other and will always create it internally if it doesn't exist for us externally.

The ultimate goal, even of a death camp, is not to kill certain people, but to erase a particular identity and culture -- people generally won't tolerate their friends, family and neighbors being murdered, so certain mechanisms have to kick in to convince people that the targeted groups are NOT their friends and neighbors. \nNazi Germany achieved this largely by casting Jews, Homosexuals, Socialists, et al. as interlopers, not \"real\" Germans, constructing them as problems or threats. That kind of rhetoric puts up such red flags now, and information flows so freely across political borders, that the \"These are not your neighbors\" rhetoric doesn't fly and has to be updated to \"These are NOT.\"\n\nIt's worth noting, too, that the erasure of a cultural identity precedes the eradication of a people because it is necessary. The contributions those people make to the national culture has to be expunged from the national identity -- I'm sure just as much of Chechnyan and Russian culture is gay as German culture is and was Jewish, because gay Russians are and always have been Russians, active in their communities and cultures like everyone else. \nSo mechanisms like Putin's gag law are necessary groundwork for mass murder: they insure both that people won't see gay Russians until they're already gone, and necessary to a post-genocide nation where people won't see the cultural contributions of the people as anything but \"Russian.\"\n\nIt's also entirely possible that this is the \"Gay-but-not-people\" construction, or the \"Not-Gay-just-criminally-insane\" version. Either of those also works, and both are probably being pushed to segments of the citizenry under some heavy dog whistling -- likely why a young progressive Russian would just not see the Gay culture, while an older Russian might see them but buy into more homophobic rhetoric.",

It was a contentious political issue on the forefront of everyone's minds, which tends to cause ideological hardening; people were taking hard-line stances against homosexuality because that's what their political \"team\" was doing.\n\nEdit: [Source](http://www.gallup.com/poll/1651/gay-lesbian-rights.aspx).

They're putting these people in labor camps and killing them and harvesting their organs to sell on China's booming organ-transplant industry (China's middle class is booming, and so is organ harvesting, gotta stay alive forever! Trump is evil tho..) They're even going as far as targeting North Korean Falun Gong practitioners and killing them/smuggling their organs back...The count is at least 2000 practitioners that have fallen prey to China, some sources, including the Falun Gong themselves estimate it to be much higher, at around 65,000 victims. China is so good tho, they're leading the world in sustainability! Right!?!?",
