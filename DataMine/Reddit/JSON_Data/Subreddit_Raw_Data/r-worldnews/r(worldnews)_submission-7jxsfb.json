The whole package is less than $100 until you graduate.\n\nThis country is so crazy.\n\nClarification: At least they get the \"student\" part right!

Next year it'll be much higher with her having cancer, etc.   \n  \n  My wife just had surgery and one of the doctors turned out to be out-of-network after the told us they were in-network. So we got a surprise $4k bill. American healthcare is pure surprise and robbery even if you do your best to prevent it as the prices are unknown.\n\nIf you want to see a typical \"Excellent\" relatively cheap American FAMILY healthcare plan, take a look at this. \n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/dJ8hL \n\nBasically $982.51/month for a family to be paid by the employee, and $946.93 to be paid by the employer. For a grand total of $1929.44/month for the \"BASE\" plan. This has a $2,500 deductible and a $5,000 max out of pocket! \n\nIf you want the upgraded plan it is only $1,213.08/month for the employee, and $946.93 for the employer for a grand total of $2,160.01/month. This only has a $3,000 Deductible/Max out of pocket! \n\nSo not counting the employer contributions, below is what it would cost a typical employee within a 12 month period if they were maximize their benefits. \n\nSo the base plan is only $11,790.12/per year + $5,000 Max out of pocket for a grand total of $16,790.12 for all IN-NETWORK services!!! If you have to go OUT-OF-NETWORK then it is only another $10,000, so worse case scenario you are ONLY out $26,790.12 for the year. \n\nIf you want the upgraded premium plan it is only $14,556.96/per year + $3,000 Max out of pocket for a grand total of $17,556.96/per year for all IN-NETWORK services! If you have to go out of network then it is another $12,000 so that brings the worse case scenario to $29,556.96 for the year. \n\nTypical American Healthcare Insurance! And this is only for things that are covered by health insurance and approved by the insurer. If it is not billed correct or covered then you are on the hook for 100% of those charges. \n\nSo you can see how someone with insurance, even good insurance, can be in deep financial distress just from paying the premiums, let alone using the insurance.

I went to a doctor a while back because I came down with something bad and my total charge was \u00a51200 (around $10), that was the total after both getting examined by the doctor and being given several medications to treat what was wrong with me (two ear infections, some sinus stuff and a cough. I probably could have spent more at the drug store trying to treat myself). With my insurance I still have to pay 30% for everything, but the overall cost of health care here is incredibly low. I can go to a dentist and get several cavities filled for less than $20, it's incredible. If I get a private insurance the cover the other 30% but I really don't see the need since it's all so incredibly cheap.",

If I break a leg tomorrow I call an ambulance and spend a couple days in hospital and that would be it. I would only pay extra for single rooms or a fancy cast, cosmetic things and I can even get those free if I happen to be allergic to the normal cast for example. Had a filling done a couple years ago, had to pay... $20 for a different material that wouldn't be different in color from the tooth itself. First instance I remember paying extra. Not to mention until 23 years of age you pay nothing, families automatically have children covered in the parents insurance.\n\nIt's not perfect mind you. The $200 are quite a lot of money in a year, enough for a vacation, but thinking about what would happen if I went on vacation without insurance and broke a leg halfway around the world, I rather go and get another free checkup at my doctors.",

All of the nice stats that show our system is broken and that there are better ways are either twisted or thrown out in favor of more sensationalized stories by our media. You really need to watch a week of Fox News to see how distorted the information getting to the average person here is.\n\nYes, there are plenty of people who have a problem paying for someone else's healthcare, but a very large amount of those people have just fallen trap to 40+ years of being lied to by politicians that somewhere out there is a large amount of the population that are scamming the system. Almost every week there will be another story about some person who has been abusing our social programs to live decadently, and the media will just not shut up about it. It's not about not caring for a fellow person, it's that they have been told those people are just stealing from them.\n\nPretty much everything you hear having to do with Americans not supporting social programs, it's because they keep getting told that people are abusing the system, and have been getting told that basically since the early 1900's. Yes, we do have a huge aversion to taxes in general, but the reasons for that are more tied into our history and identity + the awful corruption of our news and political messaging than it as to do with the average American's empathy.",

    "body": "In Sweden, worked as a lab tech after 3 year of college/university. I want a bigger challenge so I'm starting med school to hopefully become a MD. I will not pay any tuition and I'll be able to loan money through the governmental Swedish Board of Student Finance. 1/5 I don't have to pay back and right now the interest is 0,34% with a amortization schedule at max 25 years. In fact I have the option to loan even more per month since I'm accustomed to having a salary. \n\nAnd since I've worked over a year if I get so sick/injured that I need to cancel my studies I will get 80% of what I earned before studying per month for 6 months. \n\nIn fact if you're chronically ill the employment service and the Swedish Social Insurance Agency might give you sickness compensation that you can have on hold on for 2 years and continue so you don't need to risk your benefits or being in debt by trying to study to join the work force(if you try to work you get 25% of your benefits the first 6 months even if it's on hold). The benefits are paid at 25%, 50%, 75%, 100% depending on disability and severity, the percent is multiplied with a fixed sum that changes per year but you are currently getting $1100 guarenteed and up to $2200 depending if you have worked before or not.\n\nOn top of that our public transit is for the most part cheap, if you're injured, ill or handicapped you have access to special cabs that you pay the same price for as if you were taking the bus. In fact if you have a job that you can handle working while ill but can't get to you can take a taxi to work instead of receiving sickness compensation.\n\nSo in Sweden you could've been debt-free, studying tuition free while having sickness benefits if you fail. Pay $24 per doctor's visit, max $130 per year. Prescription medicine you pay a fraction of the real price on, until you reach $260. That means that no matter how sick you are you pay maximum $390 per year.\n\nBut hey, gimme some freedom.",

Having to deal with debt collectors harassing me for bills I didn't even owe, they were trying to balance bill me (some of this was when on medicaid which makes it illegal to do that at all), while I was recovering from a near total paralysis.  Do you know how fun it was to try to handle dozens of pages of bills I didn't owe while I couldn't really even use my hands very well?  \n\nA little over a year ago I had a grand mal seizure before I got realllly sick and ended up with my spinal cord eating itself and I got taken to the hospital and had a CT scan done and was sent home when they didn't see a brain bleed and told to followup with a neurologist.  That ambulance ride (who I thought were volunteers no less, I volunteered for a long time) and the hospital after insurance were still like 700 dollars and I have fucking amazing insurance.  The hospital stay where they did the video EEG was a couple more grand but then they couldn't charge me more for the year.  \n\nMy meds still aren't free, holy shit no joke if I used my states medical marijuana program I'd be spending about 1200 dollars a month on that alone, etc.  I do not defend american healthcare, but I also was an EMT/medic before and during the ACA and I have to say it was nice seeing people who otherwise were more panicked about being able to pay for their care or not worrying more about their health",

No one wants to accept it and people keep lying to themselves saying \"Oh my rep will vote in my favor.\" They don't. Not sure how much worse it has to get for shit to hit the fan. It's certainly piling up. Everything is based on tradition rather than law. The fact that people here seem to think LESS LAWS = MORE FREEDOM doesn't help either. People are realizing this with the lack of Trumps tax returns as an example. It wasn't a law. It was traditional until the tradition was broken. When your entire federal system is based on tradition, there isn't much forcing anyone to follow it. ",

The majority of the time you have a conversation with someone here about something political, they just repeat the same counter-points that are riddled with falsehoods, and that goes for both sides. Americans don't get born thinking socialism is bad, they get in wired into their head.\n\nMaybe it doesn't change your opinion, but the reason there's a huge disconnect between paying taxes for what you listed vs healthcare is because taxes have been demonized for so long in America that most people aren't ever conscious of the idea that they actually go to important things, so when something new comes up that requires more taxes it doesn't get the same treatment. If you pointed out that taxes pay for roads, fire and police departments, or schools, most Americans would probably go, \"Oh, yeah, I forgot about that\". Most foreigners I've said that to think it just means we're stupid, but that's what happens when one of the two political factions in your country makes taxes it's #1 enemy for nearly a century.",

It is disheartening, to say the least, when you get answers like these when the topic is net neutrality. Socialized Healthcare. \n\nThis is a new epidemic, IMHO. \nLogic cannot easily sever the strong ties by which we are tricked to internalize propaganda. \nThis unfortunately leads to policies such as travel bans(\"other\"izing) , further contributing to carbon emissions(global warming isn't real, and if it is, who cares?! Jesus will rescue us all) , and loosening corporate regulation(while convincing people that it helps them, not the corps. Trickle down economics is MAKE BELIEVE) \n\nIn the case of my parents' brainwashing, they have a double whammy. First is the typical American propaganda: \"your sole purpose in life is to work, add to gdp, pay taxes, and die alone with tons of junky consumer goods you never needed\" the second which makes their stances fairly severe is from fundamentalist Christianity. Really brain melting shit dude. Like cognitive dissonance and wishful thinking and \"faith\" takes center stage. \n\nTLDR; We are very heavily propagandized in America, which leads to irresponsible thought patterns, over time, this renders the general population incapable to perform the critical reasoning that is required for them to realize just how deep our pile of shit is, or to realize they are to do something about it.\nI'm on mobile please forgive bad formatting.\n\n ",

Promising monetary rewards if something is changed is bribery, but is often called lobbying.\n\nIs it arguing semantics? I guess so, but I think sometimes semantics are worth arguing. They're two very different things that, unfortunately, have come to be conflated. Making statements like \"lobbying is bribery\" or \"lobbying has to stop\" just allows people to invoke semantics for the opposite reason and say things like \"you want to deprive people of their right to petition their representatives!?\" In my opinion, it's a lot more valuable to point out what actual lobbying is and then stop things (like bribery) that try to sneak in under the same umbrella instead of just saying \"lobbying is bad.\"\n\nOn some level we are just saying the same thing, but I wanted to explain a little bit of my reasoning.",

I've actually been pricing out some dental work I still need done and it is cheaper for me to fly across the globe to South Korea and have my dental work done including travel costs than it is for me to have it done at my local dentist in the States. It makes me want to cry seeing how messed up America is at this point. \n\nPeople shouldn't have to leave the country for affordable medical/dental care but people in charge are too busy raking in money hand over fist while they tell the rest of us to work harder and pull ourselves up by the bootstraps. My older family members continue to believe this lie and keep voting for every corrupt corporate shill that runs for office because they already made their money, bought houses, and got education when it was still reasonably affordable to do so and I guess the rest of use can go fuck ourselves. \n\nI will throw a party the day that particular Baby Boomer voting bloc finally fucking dies.

The levy that we pay here is pretty small and when you walk out of a doctors office or hospital after not being financially ruined then you thank God that you have a decent public health system. It's not perfect by any means but the option isn't even worth considering. \n\nEven our conservative party would never get rid of universal healthcare. It would be suicide.

And yet, in so many ways is not. \n\nI do keep private health insurance here simply because it means that I don't have to wait for elective (non-essential or urgent) surgery if desired and I can go to a private hospital. Others who rely solely on public health may have to wait for treatment if it is not life-threatening (though they will be treated). There are other benefits that those solely on public health won't get too but it depends on what you need and want to pay for. \n\nMy private health insurance premiums and deductibles are still nowhere near what they would be in the states. Overall, still a damn sight better than worrying that one health incident could ruin you financially. The stress of that alone could kill a person. It's beyond the comprehension of most in other developed nations...",
