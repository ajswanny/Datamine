Together, they are accused of pressuring the country's major conglomerates, such as Samsung, to give tens of millions to non-profit organizations started by Choi.\n\nOn December 9th, 2016, South Korean lawmakers voted 234-56 on Friday to impeach President Park Geun-hye. \n\nAnd today, a panel of judges has ruled unanimously that the December impeachment by lawmakers should be upheld, immediately ousting President Park Geun-hye from the office.\n\nPark loses her $10,000-a-month government pension, but more importantly, immunity from prosecution. So she could face criminal charges for the alleged involvement in corruption and bribery that led to her downfall.",

It requires a house majority to bring articles of impeachment then a 2/3rds vote in the senate not just a simple majority. With a house and senate both republican controlled, that means you are waiting until at least 2018 to even attempt it. Also lets remember, \"I don't like his policies\" is not a reason for impeachment. \n\nAssuming this all happens, democrats run the 2018 elections and somehow swing the house and senate, even if he is impeached, it's extremely unlikely he is found guilty during trial at the senate. Only two presidents have had impeachment hearings and both were acquitted at their senate hearings and remained president.

    "body": "Hello, Korean here. May get downvoted to oblivion but I would like to give people a different perspective, and I will attempt to be as politically neutral as possible. \n\nThe Korean culture as is is not designed for democracy. Look at the millennias-year-old Confucianism that is still prevalent. Democracy is a specific institution that is built around individualism, the belief that everyone has an equal right to be a part of governing themselves. Confucianism to the contrary is absolutely authoritarian. It emphasizes following the orders of your political leaders, your elders, your parents, and the establishment. You can see this authoritarianism throughout every component of Korean society from even as low as elementary school and as high as at the corporate and national level. There is always a top down structure - (teacher to dude who fights well in school to the cronies to the outsiders, CEO of a conglomerate to the managers to the employees to the interns) where the higher on the ladder are never to be questioned or disregarded by those who are lower. \n\nContinuing on that, I have seen a lot of posts today about how messed up the Chaebol system (conglomerate capitalism) and authoritarian presidents are. I would attribute this to survival needs as much as tradition. In a small peninsula surrounded by the strongest countries in the world without any natural resources other than wood, it is impossible to grow in modern economy without being able to pool everything Korea possesses into a few critical central entities. R&D has only been possible in Korea because much like Google and Amazon, Chaebol companies with the reins to the entire GDP of Korea had money to throw around to develop advanced technologies without need for immediate profit. \n\nThe political left are not what you may think of as democrats in the US, they're a group with a significant number of people who think the Kims of North Korea have the right idea about a \"Communist\" authoritarian regime, immigrants from South East Asia are taking away their jobs (that rhetoric sound familiar? Korea for the Koreans a la Kim Jong Il), want to kick out the US and remove the Thaad anti-missile defense system, funnel money into nuclear North Korea in the name of Humanitarianism, and believe China can protect the Korean identity by being its traditional master. Look up the leading presidential candidate Moon Jae In and his reverence toward North Korea's OG Eternal President Kim Il Sung. \n\nThe political right believe in Chaebol Kleptocracy that almost mimics Hitler's Fascist Germany, President Park Chung Hee's military authoritarianism as being the one true solution to the Korean problem, and that Korea has far too many enemies to not be brotherly with the United States via economic and military partnership. \n\nThen you have everyone in the middle who may like to believe this whole system is a democracy, but really they end up gravitating towards whoever speaks the loudest. Democracy was the name it was given simply because the US seemed like a powerful world entity that should be mimic'd. There's voting, yes, but there is no individual idea about how the government should run. It's yelling out ideas that people simply heard about the most, joining mass rallies just because it's popular to do so; bandwagoning in general. Koreans only recognize power, and power is socially granted through popularity. Please don't mistake this whole impeachment affair as a successful display of democracy. The president simply lost the popularity contest. Bribery and authoritarianism will continue on with the next president whoever it may be. Corruption/Bribery of itself is not considered bad, what IS bad is looking incompetent by getting caught and not being able to shrug it off with an alpha personality.  \n\nAs a personal anecdote, my brother in high school was taught science by a self-proclaimed communist teacher who didn't teach any science at all but spewed red political ideals in class in order to mold students. That's the idea of a true democracy a majority of that class's students adopted. It certainly seems worth a thought. ",

    "body": "It's easy to say he was just involved in corruption and killed himself to avoid any shame. In fact, he chose suicide because the investigation went too far and tormenting his families and friends. Roh, being him, would have fought in the trial to the end and spent his time in jail if necessary. His suicide note basically says \"people are suffering too much because of me, and it won't end and I will only be a burden.\"\n\nHis long-time friend/supporter was placed under arrest and wasn't allowed to get treatment even though he had a stroke. (He was released after Roh's death but died because he didn't get the treatment in time.) Even a restaurant he frequented was investigated and got audited. Another restaurant ran by Roh's staff was investigated and everyone who spent more than $100 there was investigated. Every day the prosecutor and the NIS leaked unsubstantiated fact (some downright fabricated) to the media. Even some people in opposition said they've never seen an investigation like this and the prosecution is just trying to insult Roh by dragging out the investigation. The prosecution never showed any concrete proof against Roh. Yes, the charges were dropped due to his death, but even then they would have leaked it if they had something, to mitigate criticism against them.\n\nSure he or his family may or may not have done something wrong, but the whole investigation was clearly a political revenge by the next government. Some even claim it was a political murder. The irony is that Roh probably would not this popular if Lee Myungbak wasn't so tough on him, but now Roh is the most respected ex-president in South Korea.",

A young high school girl fails to get into a prestigious university.\n\n 2. The girl's mother uses her influence to pay the girl's way into prestigious university. They package it as the girl receiving a scholarship for her equestrian skills.\n\n 3. Girl doesn't do so well in school and later turns out she had a child during her high school years which was no-no for this school's policies.\n\n 4. Girl decides to take some time off but still demands her grades to be given to her as if she had completed her semester.\n\n 5. Professor says no. This incurs the wrath of the girl's mother who successfully convinces the professor to give her the grades. \n\n 6. This leads to a massive 80 day protest from students of that university for unfair treatment and etc.\n\n 7. This leads into investigation that eventually reveals the girl's mother had a personal relation with President Park.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\nOh shit it's about to get real funky now.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\n 1. The girl's mother turned out to be one of like 15 known children of a famous cult leader. Each children were known to have extreme assets from estimated 10s of millions to upwards of billions.\n\n 2. President Park had a scandal in the past (that many dismissed as they deemed highly improbable and a likely attack from opposing political parties) that said apparently she had a child with this cult leader while she was in her teens.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\nSo how does this relate directly to the Korean people?\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\n 1. As investigations ensued it turned out that the President Park had been exchanging emails regarding her speeches and other national policies and events with the girl's mother. Even going as far as asking her for edits and such.\n\n 2. Journalists, during the investigation, received a tablet from President Park? Girls mother? side that for some reason contained all the exchange between them. This is thought to be an unfortunate mistake by them and a fortunate mistake for the Korean people to know the truth.\n\n 3. The investigative journalists are doing this via wikileak style and slowly releasing information. More and more information have been coming out each day.\n\n 4. Latest news is what you've guys read. It seems the relationship between President Park and the cult leader's daughter (girl's mother) have been more intimate and influential than people thought. Even going far as President Park, after a hard day, going to their residence to sleep over and discuss the problems and getting advice and what not. All national secrets out on the table for the cult family. \n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\nIt's still a developing story. Koreans are wondering why the President haven't stepped down yet. It's either that or impeachment and jail for her. \n\nIt's a sad day when people are saying Korea's best presidents so far were either the dictators or the ones who just didn't do any crazy shit while in office. \n\nAll this because of one spoiled ass girl dealing with a broken education system in Korea. \n\nP. S. Be careful criticizing that spoiled ass girl. She's been threatening to kill everyone criticizing her over the internet :)\n\n----\n\nAnd now we are here :D President is stepping down and democracy wins! ",

    "body": "Other commenters have provided a bunch of valid points, but I would like to offer a more historical perspective.\n\nDuring much of its modern history, South Korea was a dictatorship under tacit approval from the United States. During the Cold War, the United States had been willing to work with foreign autocratic regimes so long as they were anti-Communist and pro-American. During this time, civil rights and democracy activists in South Korea tended to get muzzled, imprisoned or killed.\n\nIn 1980, distrust of America among South Korean democracy activists hit a new high when the United States did not intervene during the violent, bloody crackdown of the democratic uprising in the southwestern city of Gwangju. In 1987, another, more nationwide, democratic uprising successfully toppled the dictatorship.\n\nA particular political landscape was formed where conservatives were defined by, among other things, their sympathies towards past dictatorships and the American \"sponsors\". Progressives were defined by their activist and democratic credentials and distrusted the US based on their hypocritical attitude towards promoting freedom and democracy. Progressive parties also based themselves in the southwestern region of South Korea, which remembered, and still remembers, the uprising of 1980, and holds the US partly accountable for the bloodshed.\n\nThere is another dimension to this with a radical nationalistic left-wing movement in South Korea which is sympathetic to North Korea and consequently anti-American, but those folks hold less sway in the progressive discourse nowadays.",

    "body": "The writer in other posts made an interesting observation of how Korean politics in recent decades seemed to foreshadow American politics. Koreans had a political outsider (Roh Moo-hyun) riding a wave of youth enthusiasm to become president in 2002 (analogous to Obama?). Then he was followed by a former business executive turned mayor conservative president (Lee Myung-bak) in 2007 who was then followed by an incompetent candidate with authoritarian tendencies (Park Geun-hye) in 2012 (hybrid of Trump?). Perhaps this impeachment foreshadows something in America as well? :D",
