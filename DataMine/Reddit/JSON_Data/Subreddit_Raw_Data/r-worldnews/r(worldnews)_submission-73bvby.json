Having internet service somehow makes me privileged right now, so I'm trying to use it. \n \nNo one has electricity and most people don't have running water. Gas and drinking water are still scarce and hard to get. Only cash is being accepted at most stores, but many banks are still not open and many ATMs still don't work, no credit cards accepted. Most phones don't work unless you are in the highway and in the metro area, so if someone had to dial 911 from home they would die trying. Hospitals are running out of diesel to power up their generators every other day so people are dying because they can't get treated for their dialysis or any other type of life support, because the diesel is scarce or unavailable. Some people are still land locked and some are drinking water from  creeks. People are doing hours long lines to get food or gas.  I would not end if I were to mention everything going wrong at the moment. To top it all off many of us have not been to work since hurricane Irma which was almost a month ago, so we don't have any money (many people are loosing their jobs permanently too) and we have been stuck inside our homes for that long, with nothing to do but stare at the ceiling all day. Our houses have become scarcity Jails. This is a very draining and mentally straining situation. PLEASE don't be fooled by any media outlet or politician saying we are doing better, WE ARE NOT, keep talking of us, we need it, I beg you. ",

The Governor has been fighting back against this myth that Puerto Rico has been abandoned by the Federal government and praising Trump's support for the territory. https://pjmedia.com/trending/2017/09/25/puerto-ricos-governor-dismantles-media-attacks-trumps-response-hurricane-irma/\n\nTrump was on Twitter as recently as yesterday trying to bring more attention to the fact that Puerto Rico, despite being a US territory, is way behind US states in forms of infrastructure and finances. They simply have too much debt to deal with to financially handle a disaster of this scale on their own. (For those that didn't know, this is one of the chief reasons they are not a State.) https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/912478274508423168\n\nFEMA has been operating on a 24 hour schedule in Puerto Rico and the USVI since at least 23 September.

The federal support for fuel transportation includes air and sea logistical support by the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA), U.S. Northern Command, the U.S. Navy, and U.S. Coast Guard, in coordination with the private sector.\nPower is restored to Centro M\u00e9dico Hospital in San Juan and San Pablo Hospital in Bayam\u00f3n, Puerto Rico.

The port is a crucial lifeline for Puerto Rico, which gets most of its supplies from the U.S. mainland. Early reports indicate that about 80 percent of the island's agriculture was wiped out in the storm, which will raise the importance of food aid and commercial food shipments. In the USVI, most ports on St. Thomas and St. Croix have reopened with restrictions, along with Cruz Bay on St. John. http://www.maritime-executive.com/article/recovery-effort-ramps-up-in-puerto-rico\n\nBefore Maria USCG assets and personnel were strategically positioned with relief supplies, including water, in areas near the USVI and Puerto Rico.\n\nUSCG said the crew of the Coast Guard Cutter Donald Horsley are en route from Cura\u00e7ao to Puerto Rico and USVI with more than 800 gallons of bottled water. Air crews from USCG Sector Southeast in Miami are being deployed for search and rescue missions, and other resources will be delivered as needed by further assets and personnel.\n\nCoast Guard personnel have been responding to the aftermath of Hurricane Irma and to Hurricane Maria for days.\n\nhttp://www.seatrade-cruise.com/news/news-headlines/us-coast-guard-crews-respond-to-maria-in-puerto-rico-and-usvi.html",

USAF C-17 pilot with the air national guard here, and I can tell your we've been flying our assess off in support of all of the major storms (keep in mind there have been several) since last month. We've been bringing everything from peace keeping to humanitarian supplies. \n\nWe can get the supplies there no problem. It's off loading and disseminating these supplies that's the problem.\n\nHere's another aside -- if you haven't noticed, there a lot of other mil operations going on, so the majority of these hurricane relief missions have fallen on the national guard command and control as opposed to the normal active duty C2 agencies. The crews and support personnel at the local levels have stepped up considerably to handle much of this planning autonomously (fortunately we're trained to do that)\n\nAnd I can tell you I haven't even been paid because finding is so messed up right now. However, that's not a concern of mine -- as long as we do our best to help these people out. And I don't think there is a pilot or load master out there who doesn't feel the same.\n\nSo please, think of the logistical impact multiple hurricanes will have on our logistical infrastructure before you run your mouth about how maddening it is these people haven't received any help.",

Lets see if we can focus this a bit please.\n\nWe have officials on the ground saying the situation is dire, and that they need immediate help or there will be many lives lost, and that they are not getting even close to what they need. \n\nSimultaneously, Trump is saying they are doing a \"tremendous\" job on the relief efforts, and that theyre doing all they can. \n\nBoth the Mayor of San Juan and Governor of Puerto Rico are being accused of politicizing and sensationalizing their comments in opposite directions; it is being said the governor is a suck up to Trump, and that the mayor is a heavy critic. These effectively discredit both of their statements, leaving the rest of us at a loss as to the real picture.\n\nThis is further distorted and confusing because there is no power, and essentially no communication. Because of this we have little documented footage and accounts of what exactly is happening on Puerto Rico.\n\nWhat is the truth? Is Puerto Rico turning into an anarchy free for all? How much help is really available from the U.S. Government and how is it being distributed? Is this being exaggerated?\n\nIf you have any insight or information to share to clarify the situation, please share.",

The West supplied food, fuel, and other materials by air to keep 2 million West Berliners afloat despite a total blockade via land routes by the Soviet Union. \n\nPuerto Rico has 3.4 million people, and is 19 times the area of West Berlin. West Berlin had working infrastructure during the airlift and given that it was 185 square miles, nobody lived all the far from the airport. Puerto Rico is 3500 square miles of tropical and mountainous terrain with a completely collapsed infrastructure and blocked roads. \n\nAt the height of the operation an aircraft landed every minute. \n\nNow, I know this isn't an exact analogue. We have ports in Puerto Rico, we don't have logistics left over from a recent war in the area, technology has changed, Puerto Rico is more geographically isolated, etc. \n\nMy point here is to simply show how Incredibly immense the challenge is here by comparing it to a similarly immense logistical challenge. It's going to take extraordinary, once in several generations, next level logistics way beyond what you might see if whole armies were deployed to address the total food, fuel and rebuilding needs to sustain 3.4 million people.\n\nIf the government is not ringing alarm bells on at least the order of the Berlin Airlift, they are probably off by an order of magnitude in their response.\n\nIt's that bad.

Let me lay out some facts.\n\nIn 08 my strike group went to assist in relief for the Philippines, we delivered 260 tons of supplies in like 5 days. We also helped restore power and a bunch of other shit. Most of you have no idea the actual capability of our fleet... The fact that there is two Navy ships off the coast and it's been over a week, that's a god damn embarrassment. I've been apart of two other huge humanitarian relief efforts from a carrier flight deck including Fukushima. I've seen what our Navy is capable of and what PR has gotten is a joke.\n\nWe sent the USS Lincoln to help with South Florida but apparently sending a carrier to PR isn't as important as the main land of the US. There are three carriers in Norfolk right now that are sea ready. None have been sent.\n\nBeyond that we have CH53s that can external carry 8-10 ton payloads. We have V-22s that can external carry 5 ton payloads no problem. We have SH60s out the ass that can carry a couple tons each. I've fucking SEEN THIS HAPPEN with my own eyes and personally been apart of it. Yet when it comes to PR we sent two ships? (I know there are a couple more on the way now, FINALLY). If a carrier was there they could easily have 7-8 helo spots if not more on going at the same time coming in and out taking in tons of supplies.\n\nThis is just a huge failure. I don't care how you want to paint it, this is a failure to respond. At this point we should have already delivered 1000s of tons of supply all over this island. \n\nYou can easily fly at least 20 sorties a day per helo and even if they carried only a ton a piece... there's no reason supplies shouldn't haven't reached everyone by now. \n\nThis is a massive failure and people will die because of it. Period.\n\n\n",

I said something about how, \"They probably have clean water by now, since supplies have started coming in... I mean, it's not like they're drinking out of puddles. \"\n\nFuck.\n\nEDIT: Since a few people have already asked separately, I'll elaborate a little...\n\nMy boyfriend's aunt is like 75 years old, and all she does and has done for years is take care of everyone else. She's taken in a couple of teenage kids and is raising them, she feeds everyone, she goes broke sometimes trying to shelter & help everyone... \n\nAnyway, she's always been like a Saint, so we plan to just keep sending what we can, when we can until we hear otherwise. We know that she will distribute & share what she can if she doesn't have use for something, or has a surplus of anything.\n\nSo, with regard to using her address so that anyone that wants to avoid using a charity or organization, but wants to donate/contribute directly to the people would have the means to do so... I would definitely consider doing that. I'm not quite sure of the best way to go about doing something like that yet, but I'll figure it out easily enough!",

Hot days with nothing better to do than to listen to AM radio and hear what the fuck could be happening and any news and hot nights that the only way to sleep is to be completely wiped out tired. You either have a generator or you don't and mine got wrecked because last time we used it was years ago on another minor hurricane/tropical storm. Luckily a neighbor was kind enough to throw us an extension to his generator to power the fridge and charge electronics. Service is sketchy as the word sketchy is. Like a fuck buddy it comes and goes but it's getting better with the passing days. \n\nAfter a couple days people started coming out and lines began to form around ATM and gas stations. ATM lines cooled down but you could still wait for your turn at the gas station a couple of hours or so. Grocery stores also have lines to get in and they are long as fuck. \n\nBy week two shit's beginning to clear now and it's passable enough to make it by car in the metro area and some business began to open up again. School won't start for another month probably and that is bad news for anybody in the UPR system. \n\nOverall there's not much to do but wait the day at home, go to work if your workplace calls you, or stand in line for food and gas.

The majority of our wooden pylons have fallen and some of our concrete ones have been broken in half. Water has been slowly getting back up and running in some homes. However, most citizens in the island are being supplied water through water trucks or oasis. Most of our roads are still blocked by trees and some landslides but it\u2019s starting to get fixed. Our biggest issue, in my opinion, is that our communication network is heavily damaged. That means that properly coordinating what to do is a complete nightmare. If we were to fix our communication problem ASAP, we could fix the others much more efficiently. If I forgot something that you want to know, don\u2019t hesitate to ask. \n\nEDIT: There\u2019s food here in the island. The problem is getting the food to the people due to the road problems I mentioned before. Another big issue with getting food is that all transactions have to be done CASH ONLY due to that our ATM system has gone down. So, in order to get cash you only have a few open banks to do so. Which means standing in long lines and hoping that the cash doesn\u2019t run out. \n\nEDIT 2: Thanks for u/SouthernSmoke for telling me to share the images I have through imgur. Here\u2019s the link: https://imgur.com/gallery/1hYjF BTW I plan on adding more images of other regions in the next few days. \n\nPS: If you want to be kept well informed about our situation, follow @DavidBegnaud in Twitter.

    "body": "I live in a suburban town close to San Juan in the metro area...  damages are mostly plants/trees, streetlights that have fallen over and damage to the power and water infrastructure - though there are homes that had wooden sections which were completely obliterated. The town has done a decent enough job removing obstacles and fallen debris and clearing roads. As of today, streets are mostly clear. Power was restored to half of my neighborhood not including my house, and running water is coming in as of a few hours ago.\n\n\nA few days ago in order to buy gasoline you had to make 11 hour lines (no joke, my dad was in one last Tuesday). These have been reduced significantly to about 3 to 4 hours depending on availability. Similar lines to go into Costco o Sam's club or any local supermarket to get bottled water. Helped my family make a 4 hour line today to buy ice in order to cool down products like insulin and such.\n\n\nI see that some progress is being made so I can't speak badly about recovery efforts, however there are people that are in very dangerous situations such as the elderly or sick and people living in rural areas. Diesel demand is at an all time high and priority is being given to both sick people and elderly, but if we don't get supplied a constant flow of it, the power generators powering both elderly homes and smaller hospitals and/or treatment centers will be useless. Thankfully most big hospitals are powered at least in the metro area.\n\n\nA conjunctivitis epidemic might be starting, aided by the fact that running water is scarce.\n\n\nCommunications are spotty but some areas have cell phone data. I haven't been able to contact family members in the western part of the island nor in the rural areas, so I have no idea how they are. \n\n\nAs far as food goes, there are places opening up since Tuesday including fast food restaurants. Food doesn't seem to be a problem, the problem is driving to those places because of the gasoline lines. \n\n\nThere has been a curfew since the day after the storm from 6 am to 7pm which as of today was extended to 9pm. Most people making lines for gas have been ignoring it, and police haven't arrested people making lines. Alcohol sale has been banned for the same period and it ended just today. \n\n\nMost of my friends are planning on moving to the states, and I wish I could but funds are low and I'd rather stay put for a bit.\n\n\nIf you are looking to help, **bottled water** should be a priority. There are a lot of people looking for both that and gasoline for cars/power generators (obviously you can't bring gasoline, just mentioning which seem to be the priority for most people). Hygiene products are also immensely helpful.",

The shelters are mostly full and the restaurants are open. I hear the truck drivers are on strike, taking a shower sucks, and the gas lines block the road. Most of the trees fell but have been cleared already with the folks and the chainsaws much less most everyone had a machete. The k marts Wal-Mart's etc are still running fine just have long lines and most of the nice warm food is at the open restaurants. Electricity is taking a while to fix but water has been restored for some people. Nothing else really, rations where given out but they where kinda shit. Most people seem to be going back to their jobs, roads are still kinda shit but that's Puerto Rico most of the time. Landslides blocked some of the side roads but the main highway has been cleared and most of the smaller roads blocking houses where cleared with machete. I also have images from imgur.",

It started at $10 and went higher, but it only seemed to be done by a few gas stations, not all.\n\nJust a few days ago some phone carriers started providing services, that are slowly but surely working.\nHere in Puerto Rico we have 5 main carriers, AT&T, T-Mobile, Claro (Used to be Verizon), Sprint and Open Mobile. As far as I know, only Claro and AT&T have managed to get their services running, but aren't fully stable as of yet.\n\nGetting information is fairly hard, although its a lot easier for us who have access to the internet. Fake or misleading news can spread like wildfires, especially on those very long lines, for anything. Walmart, Supermarkets, Gas stations, ATMs, you name it; if its operating and they have anything that people are looking for, its gonna have a long line.\n\nWe are all living day by day, just winging it.\n\nI probably missed a bunch of stuff you wanted to know, so feel free to ask\n\nI am from Mayag\u00fcez, if you were wondering.",

    "body": "It is only a \"tad\" (/s) more complex then keyboard warriors believe. Speaking strictly from an Army perspective:\n\n\n1) Every person sent there is 1 more person that needs food/water. There is a fine balance between sending the right amount of people and sending too many people. In addition, every vehicle requires fuel. And its a pretty well known fact there is not a single vehicle in the Army's inventory that gets good MPG. This equates to a huge increase in fuel demand on the island.\n\n\n2) Soldiers were already sent to Texas/Florida. They are now basically redeploying from those locations to PR. That takes time. Not every unit in the Army has the capability to do what PR needs. Heavy lifting and transport on the scale needed are limited to very specific units.\n\n\n3) C5s/C17s take a lot runway to land, it also takes some time to make sure the runways are capable to hold the aircraft after the storm. Then you have to deal with the fact that we have limited aircraft in the inventory and prioritize missions. From what I have seen though, USAF and USTRANSCOM are doing a good job of diverting craft from other missions to support relief efforts.\n\n\n4) There is seriously no infrastructure in a lot of PR right now. Most of our vehicles are extremely heavy. Wet soggy ground and washed out roads will quickly lead to us having stuck trucks or ruining what little infrastructure is left. And this is not a location attached to the CONUS where we can just convoy in supplies as needed.\n\n\nI could keep going for days, but those are just some of challenges people are faced with while going to assist.\n\n\nSorry for the sort of ranty post, it just gets me going (not from you but others) that the military is not doing anything. I assure you it is, but it does take time. And it's not like you can just run outside and hook up to a helicopter and sling load over to the island. People seem to have this false understanding that you can put an unlimited amount of supplies in a plane, send an unlimited amount of Soldiers, and be there 5seconds after it happens. And even if you could, disaster relief is seriously a very complex problem. Just read through the comments here and every one will have different ideas on what needs to be fixed first and how to do it. The real world is the exact same way with the same problems. ",

    "body": "Hi, i live in San Juan and there are a few things that aren't being reported in the media. Yesterday I went to Mayag\u00fcez and the situatino is pretty grim. One of my friends grandma, aunt, and first cousins are stuck in Las Mar\u00edas, we haven't heard from them since the storm. This is because there have been mudslides and road blockages in the remote mountainous area there and we really don't know if they're going to make it or not. \n\nIn the areas near the capital the situation is stressful but the supplies are there, the problem is getting to the rest of the island. We know that the air force is using the Aguadilla airport but there seems to be difficulty in getting to the interior (Las Marias, San Sebastian, Lares, North Yauco, Maricao, Jayuya etc.). For example, I have family in Lares and I still haven't heard from them. \n\nComms are down for the south and southeast of the island. The west has claro network only in hormigueros/a\u00f1asco/aguada/aguadilla/mayaguez/ric\u00f3n. The metro area has att running. The comms grind is unstable also (i'm writing through sat wifi from my phone). \n\nElectricity is out, Mayaguez has the medical center and parts of town with running electricity. San Juan has very few places with electricity. San Juan has very few places with running electricity as they are trying to get the 'Centro M\u00e9dico' running.\n\nIt's important to note that the water agency is almost to the halfway mark with regards to supply. Ie. almost half of the registered payer base has running potable water. \n\nThe deaths I think have been under reported. There have been deaths as a consequence of the autorelief effort. Deaths due to lack of electricity/medical needs through things like mechanical ventilators and pacemakers have not been reported accurately...\n\nWith respect to security, I think one soldier was kidnapped. There have been a lot of under reported rapes and robberies. Due to there being no electricity, especially in the east part of the island, there has been note of looting due to primary resource scarcity (food, water, gas). We've heard of different things going on like, gangs going to unguarded gas stations and robbing the fuel at gunpoint. Gangs going to unguarded gas trucks and stealing them. People stealing other people's gas through shady techniques like breaking your gas tank and filling a bucket. Illegal third-party selling of diesel at 1 gallon $12.. the list goes on..\n\nAnyways, hope that helps.",

The Puerta Rican government has to request military help before it can be granted.  The governor waited until Wednesday night to request it.  And here we are.\n\n**Edit:**\n\nJust gonna quote that article because people don't click links: \n\n>\"In Puerto Rico, Containers Full Of Goods Sit Undistributed At Ports\"\n\n>September 28, 20175:59 PM ET\n>Heard on Morning Edition\n\n>Millions of people in Puerto Rico need fuel, water, food and medicine. More than a week after Hurricane Maria devastated the island, major infrastructure is still down. Stores have trouble filling their shelves. Families are running low on the supplies they stockpiled before the storm, and across the island, many residents say they haven't seen any aid deliveries.\n\n>**Meanwhile, at the port in San Juan, row after row of refrigerated shipping containers sit humming. They've been there for days, goods locked away inside.**\n\n>It's one thing to get supplies to Puerto Rico. But officials at the Department of Homeland Security, which administers FEMA, say moving goods around the island is the bigger challenge.\n\n>Diesel is short. Drivers are scarce. And authorities say some roads are still impassable, although local officials dispute that explanation.\n\n>These containers were brought to the island by Crowley, a maritime shipping company. The company started unloading shipments on Saturday. By Friday, it will have received more than 4,000 loaded crates.\n\n>**Most of the containers coming in have never left. Crowley says it has more than 3,400 commercial containers at its terminal now. That's just one shipping company, at one port. Several other ports are accepting shipments, and stranded crates total an estimated 10,000.**\n\n>\"These containers are full of food, these containers are full of water, full of medicine ... full of construction materials,\" says Vice President Jose Ayala, who notes a barge a day has arrived since the port opened on Saturday. \"It has reached Puerto Rico. The problem is we can't get it on the shelves.\"\n\n>Ayala says it's frustrating: \"People are out there under so much need, and there's this cargo here.\"\n\n>\"Plenty of vessels can get cargo to the island,\" agrees Mark Miller, Crowley's vice president of communications. \"But the real difficulty is getting the goods to the people via trucks.\"\n\n>Meanwhile, hundreds of thousands of pounds have been delivered to the airport by commercial airlines, and the Department of Defense and FEMA have also been bringing in deliveries by air. Everybody \u2014 the government, aid groups and private firms \u2014 is having trouble moving those goods around.\n\n>Hundreds of refrigerated containers here posing an extra problem. Stores without fuel for their generators can't accept goods that need to be kept cool.\n\n>The Puerto Rico Federal Affairs Administration tells NPR that the government is working with the truck driver's union to find a solution for driving with downed power lines and damaged roads, and the Department of Defense says it has sent teams to work on clearing blocked streets.\n\n>**Not everyone believes roadways are the problem. Roberto Ramirez Kurtz is the mayor of Cabo Rojo in southwestern Puerto Rico, which is about as far away from San Juan as you can get on the island \u2014 a 2 \u00bd to 3-hour drive.**\n\n>He says more than 5,000 homes were completely destroyed in his town, and people are running out of water and insulin. But aid and resources, \"they're staying in San Juan,\" he says.\n\n>**Kurtz was in San Juan to ask for help, and having made the trip himself, he doesn't believe that road conditions are an obstacle. \"The roads are open,\" he says. \"I've been able to come here. So why haven't we used this to [transport goods] west?\"**\n\n>Meanwhile Juan Carlos Garcia, the mayor of Coamo in the south of the island, says the only aid his town has received is five pallets of water. \"The state never came to provide diesel to the hospital,\" he says. People are running low on food supplies and hysteria is growing, he says.\n\n>**He, too, says the roads are clear \u2014 and that he's in San Juan to ask why no aid has reached his town.**\n\n>Along with road conditions, authorities and shipping firms also say diesel shortages are to blame. Long lines for gas are persistent all over the island. Distributing fuel across Puerto Rico is FEMA's number one priority, the Department of Defense says, to help alleviate the issue.\n\n>Richard Darmanin, the vice president of Capitol Transportation Inc., says import paperwork is having to be done manually, which is also slowing down the process. And standing outside the port earlier this week, looking at the rows of containers, he said an even bigger problem is the lack of drivers.\n\n>You have a shortage of drivers who have lost a lot during the storm,\" he says. \"You may have a huge fleet but they ain't moving themselves.\"\n\n>\"Whatever driver shows up, we put him to work,\" he says.\n\n>The governor of Puerto Rico has issued an appeal for anyone with a commercial license to help distribute gas, Darmanin says.\n\n>**Delivering goods by air isn't an automatic solution either, says Nino Correa, the director of search and rescue for Puerto Rico. He's also been tasked with coordinating drops of food and water from helicopters to aid stranded residents.**\n\n>**\"It's difficult because of the make-up of our island,\" he says. \"It's very mountainous and it's very dangerous for air operations to be taken to certain places,\" he says \u2014 risky not just for the air crew, but for people on the ground.**\n\n>The government is carrying out drops as best it can, he says.\n\n>\"This is the first time in our island that we have received a hurricane that has impacted us like this,\" he says. \"And we know that if life is difficult during an emergency, during a disaster it's a lot more difficult.\n\n>\"We're working very hard for this,\" he says. \"There are a lot of people working hard to build [Puerto Rico] back up.\"",

It should have been waiting before the huricane hit, and been mobilized the moment it passed.  The executive has failed us, this is quite solidly their job, and it wasn't until days AFTER the hurricane we knew was coming that anything was begun.\n\nIt's absolutely maddening that people will suffer because of a government more concerned with image than doing its job.\n\n*edit* since /r/thedonald has come in force, I am not talking specifically about him, but the entire executive.   The logistics should be planned.  The equipment and personnel for distribution should be in place.   A bunch of crates of food and water sitting on planes or in warehouses aren't helping anyone.  Compare the deployment of the aid in Houston to this mess?\n\nThe fact is PR has been shortchanged in its aid, and the current issues were avoidable.  I'm sorry, but its just dishonest to say that the response to maria has been adequate, and certainly not as well planned and organized as the responses to harvey and irma.\n\nI want to be clear, I used the term the executive, not the president, because it encompasses, fema, the coast guard, the national guard, and a dozen other agencies involved in this.  The executive branch is a whole lot bigger than 1 man, despite what people seem to think.\n\n*edit 2* literacy needs work.  Let me help people through that first sentence.  Massive amounts of aid should already have been there BY NOW.  Because it should have been waiting before the hurricane hit.   Nothing I said implies it should have been there before the storm... in fact my next sentence clarifies that with the mobilization comment.  The issue is that raw goods are not aid.  Goods that are distributed are.   Having a million pounds of food but not distribution plans is not aid, and the aid should have been there by now, if proper planning had been done.\n\n*edit 3*  goods sitting in a warehouse are not aid.   It's not aid until it's in the hands of the people that need it.  So you can stop telling me how there's Goods rotting in a warehouse and pretending like that's the government doing its job",

It's a relief when the National Guard gets mobilized and they do home-checks and deliver supplies, and clear roads just so the fleets of hundreds of power trucks can restore service. Right now in PR they don't have trucks or drivers for them. Shit isn't getting done.

It's possible to inundate the ports/airport to where they can't function once transportation to the outlying areas is up and running.\n\nStory time:  Guam got run over by a 200mph typhoon a couple decades ago.  FEMA sent 2 747s full of cargo timed to land 25 minutes after the airfield opened.  Without checking if any equipment that can offload these planes were operational...and none were.  Well, they could offload the belly compartments so there's 18 pallets of the total 84 aboard.  So the cargo was there, on planes but couldn't be offloaded. \n\nFEMA stood up an office on the island afterwards so there was plenty of time to 'educate' FEMA about timeliness and being too early.\n\nLook at what's going on in PR now.  3,000+ containers (seavans) sitting on the docks, burning thru their limited supply of diesel keeping the chilled supplies cold but will run out in a day or so.  And no way to move the stuff inland.  So now they will have spoiling supplies to get rid of and taking up room for good stuff...see how timing is everything in these kinds of situations..\n\nYes, the US govt should've notified PR and the media of what/who/where all the support was going.  And how the stuff would be transported to the cities or other rally points.  This would calm the PR residents by saying help is rolling to them and get the media off the US Govt's back so things could flow.\n\nEdited typos.",

It's a logistical nightmare; the aid is being delivered to the island, but once there it has an extremely difficult time getting anywhere.\n\nI know everyone wants to pile on Donald about shit, and *believe me*, he's awful, but it is wrong to suggest that aid isn't being sent.

The deployments I had were complacent compared to disaster relief.\n\nIf I could call my Chief and ask to go to Puerto Rico I would, I know those Airmen can do it well and fast. On top of being the right thing to do, it's the perfect opportunity to exercise their abilities and put troops in a high pressure situation while the 'war' is idle and it flexes our military capability.",

Don\u2019t get me wrong, I think we should send every armed services personnel and supplies we can to aid them until the situation stabilizes. But I was also a marine during multiple  times where we were told that we may or may not receive a paycheck on the 1st of the month. When all the dumpsters on base were overflowing and there were piles of trash around them, because the marine corps didn\u2019t have the funds at the end of the fiscal year to pay the waste disposal companies. At times we pitched in funds between different shops in our department, taking turns buying toilet paper so we could wipe our asses at work. So when people ask why we don\u2019t have 10,000 marines there, day one, making everything right in the world. I think of the amount of airwing marines that have been killed recently due to pilot error or maintenance issues because they didn\u2019t have the funding to properly train our pilots or maintain our aircraft. Or the times when I couldn\u2019t wipe my own ass without supplying my own shit tickets. ",

We are all geared up and ready to fly over right now.  We've been given the order to prepare to deploy.  The biggest issue right now is that the bulk of space in airplanes are being taken up by class 1 supplies (food/water) so there's little to no room to deploy military units in bulk. I've seen 1-2 companies (about 100-120 people) at a time fly out over the last week, but getting more people in immediately becomes a nightmare as they don't have enough food and water coming in right now as it stands.  The previous poster is correct; there should have been more supplies pre-positioned in Puerto Rico, but that didn't happen and this is the result.\n\nEdit:  Other people have mentioned it also but figured it was worth mentioning, the remaining infrastructure is nigh incapable of supporting any of the vehicles we would bring with us right now.

I assume there will be a horrible number of people that fall ill just from drinking unclean water. \n\nBring a few bottles of Neosporin,  aspirin, benodryl, and rubbing alcohol(betadine if you can find it) . And a solid first aid kit. Be sure you have a roll of gauze.\n\nBuy a lifestraw, and put together a backpack that is \"zombie-apocalypse\" ready... prepare for the absolute worse so anything that comes up can be dealt with. A good knife and flashlight+headlamp, and roll of duct tape are very important. \n\nBring the most concentrated form of soap you can find, something with multiple uses...\n\nQuick dry clothing, multiple pairs of socks and underwear....like way more than you think you'll need. \n\nGet some Datrex or comparable high calorie/lightweight emergency rations and DO NOT touch them unless you are forced to. \n\nI know nothing about the situation you would be in if you find a group to work with there, but you need to be prepared for any circumstances. Do not trust that you will be taken care of by any organization.  I say all of this from experience with the floods just in Louisiana and I can only imagine how much worse things are down there. The people that will be helping will be in pretty bad shape too, and the people who are running it will undoubtedly be ill equipped.\n\nI hope all goes well and you are able to help expedite the situation. I hope to hear that you make it down and can do some good in such a terrible time. \n\nStay dry, stay with a group you can trust, and help where you can without putting yourself in a situation that will make you another victim instead of another person making things better, and thank you for doing what you can.\n",

The sheriff donated all the meat in his freezer and we were able to get by. Then the superintendent showed up and told us to use all the supplies from the kitchen that we needed.

For an idea of it, a 7 mile, two lane residential road in Jacksonville, FL took nearly a week to clear back in 2006, and that was with a near-miss.
