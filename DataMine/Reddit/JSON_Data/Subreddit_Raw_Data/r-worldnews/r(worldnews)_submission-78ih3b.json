What makes it ok for ads to take up screen time on the television or news sites but for some reason it's morally reprehensible on social media? Who decides when politics can rear it's ugly head, are children's books ok? college textbooks? newspaper, mass letters? There are social platforms built on sharing and discussing political information. Would you shut down those or even this subreddit since it's mostly politics, what about /r/politics? Just because of a vague feeling of \"this shouldn't be here\".\n\nThere isn't really a reason.\n\n>unintelligent trust whatever they read on social media more than anything else\n\nThis is an opinion, and claiming that the need to protect \"the unintelligent\" from social media instead of any situation where they could actually kill people or themselves like driving seems silly. Neighbors could also lie to them, should we ban those? \"Politics should stay out of neighborly discussion\"\n\n>Anything to help clean it up or make it more difficult to fake things is a huge step in the right direction.\n\nIs this better? It's more regulated but it just means that now Twitter has a monopoly on how something is labeled. If Twitter was bought by some stormfront jackass and he used it in a way to further his goals (like reddit being caught censoring conservative stories multiple times in the past) would it still be better, or is it only better because you haven't thought out the consequences and think they'll always be on \"your side\"?",
