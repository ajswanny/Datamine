From what I can remember it did a pretty good job of really examining the ins and outs of how nuclear power really works, addressed the dangers and waste associated with it, and properly countered a lot of the traditional arguments against it. It also touched on the oil and gas industry\u2019s track record of running calculated smear campaigns against the concept of nuclear before it could really get off the ground, which isn\u2019t super surprising.\n\n\nAgain, not claiming nuclear is the answer to all our problems because I watched a two hour documentary on it one night on Netflix. It was just a movie, I\u2019ve read only a little on the critical responses to it and I can\u2019t vouch for the validity of all the claims made in it. But it was definitley interesting, and I\u2019ve genuinely wondered about the viability of nuclear power ever since.",

They were asking us to stop doing nuclear fusion (we never did fusion) and were showing us geiger counter values that were as ridiculously small as the values you'd find in a hospital or a macdonalds. The general consensus from researchers was that they had to be careful not to give in to greedy lobbies who would bypass the safety protocols, and instead keep research on top so that nuclear energy could remain a credible source of power with no emissions. In fact, the year I worked there the director (or CEO or whatever) did a budget forecast in a meeting (I went there for the free cookies), and I was amazed that they spent more money on safety protocols than on the actual project. One researcher told me they could have finished their \"objectives\" 10 years earlier for about 50 times less money if they were managed by some nasty businessman, but because research was on top, they decided to be careful and patient and avoid any kind of issue. Everybody praises germany for closing their nuclear research, but they just import energy from outside and can close their eyes on how \"clean\" that energy might be. At least in France we took responsability. I wish there was more in the media about it rather than the usual big alarming/uneducated headlines.",

People give America crap all the time for not signing on to this or that meaningless gesture but in truth the United States (through private industry) has done far more to advance actual change from solar technology to battery chemistry to smart grid infrastructure to moonshots like self driving cars and geoengineering. We get another bullshit law or bill out or Europe every month and none of them help the world in any way. The EU needs to get real, China and America are already doing their part.",

So if you are happy just consuming lots of cheap electricity when you've got sun or wind, but freeze in the dark in winter, then  renewables are the way to go.\n\nPersonally I like to have it warm in winter and a lamp works wonders for me when the sun is down, so renewables are not sufficient for my needs.\n\nHere an interesting article on the subject: http://euanmearns.com/more-on-going-off-grid-in-uk/",

I'm not convinced this is due to legislation like the above, it seems like a lot of it is due to historic happenstance and timing. Regardless of the cause, they are still far better off than the countries you've named. I do agree that solar tech might eventually help the US to catch up, but it's going to take a while.

I'm not sure I have much faith that we would manage to properly care for and look after potentially very toxic sites for possibly centuries, and likely long after we've moved on to something else.\n\n\nOne of the selling point of nuclear energy would be that while building a plant costs a fortune, once up and running the energy produced is very cheap and plentiful.

Mandating these goals is ridiculous, wait until the technology is viable to make these proclamations, set goals or whatever but creating legislation that requires these goals places burdens on others.",
