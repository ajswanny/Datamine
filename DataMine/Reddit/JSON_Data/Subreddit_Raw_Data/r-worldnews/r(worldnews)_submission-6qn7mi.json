It doesn't even necessarily make people be more honest; we all know there are those that end up lying so their connections thing they lead a better life than they really do. \n\nOn the other hand, I currently think there are tons of advantages to anonymity. The other person may be a 60 year old or even a 16 year old. They may be homeless or a multi-millionaire. I get to be my true self, and get to share thoughts with all kinds of people from all around the world. The other person may even be a neighbour, or someone I cross paths with every day. \n\nI played games with someone twice my age. Had someone half my age that'd set me straight. My best friends are people I would never have met in real life. One of them ended up kickstarting my career, the other one keeps me mentally stable. \n\nHence why when I see posts like these I can't help but to feel really sad. There are real people behind the handles, some may be greater than we can imagine. ",

A good friend online friend of mine passed away. I was pretty shaken up by it. It was the first time I could recall losing a friend so suddenly. I got a little bit obsessive, trying to understand what had happened. She had a final comment on a message board we frequented that, at the time, I thought was pretty cryptic: \"yo o7\". I racked my brains, trying to see if there was some secret meaning, something that could have helped me prevent her death if I had acted fast enough. I don't even remember the context of the original post anymore, but I never did forget that final message.\n\nIt's pretty funny now to realize it was a salute. Just a playful \"yo\" followed by a little salute smiley. Somehow, in all my years on the internet, I never caught that.\n\nI feel like a bit of a jackass, but I want you to know that your simple explanation brought a little peace to my soul. Thank you.",
