    "body": "Perhaps one of the most interesting and colorful words in the English language today is the word \"fuck\".\n\nIt is a magical word which, just by its sound can describe pain, pleasure, love, and hate. In language, \"fuck\" falls into many grammatical categories.\n\nIt can be used as a verb both transitive (John fucked Mary) and intransitive (Mary was fucked by John).\n\nIt can be an action verb (John really gives a fuck),\n\na passive verb (Mary really doesn't give a fuck),\n\nand adverb (Mary is fucking interested in John),\n\nas almost every word in a sentence (fuck the fucking fuckers),\n\nor as a noun (Mary is a terrific fuck).\n\n\n\nIt can also be used as an interjection (Fuck! I'm late for my date with Mary).\n\nIt can even be used as a conjunction (Mary is easy, fuck she's also stupid).\n\n\nAs you can see there are very few words with the overall versatility of the word fuck.\n\nAside from its sexual connotations, this word can be used to describe many situations:\n\n1. Greetings.........\"How the fuck are ya?\"\n\n2. Fraud...............\"I got fucked by the car dealer.\"\n\n3. Resignation.......\"Oh, fuck it!\"\n\n4. Trouble.............\"I guess I'm fucked now.\"\n\n5. Aggression.........\"Fuck you!\"\n\n6. Disgust................\"Fuck me.\"\n\n7. Confusion.............\" What the fuck....?\"\n\n8. Displeasure............\"Fucking shit man...\"\n\n9. Lost........................\"Where the fuck are we?\"\n\n10.Disbelief...............\"Unfuckingbelievable!\"\n\n11.Retaliation.............\"Up your fucking ass!\"\n\n12. Apathy.................\"Who really gives a fuck?\"\n\n13. Suspicion.............\"Who the fuck are you?\"\n\n14. Directions..............\"Fuck off.\"\n\nIt can be maternal........\"Motherfucker!\"\n\nIt can be used to tell time.......\"It's four fucking twenty!\"\n\nIt can be used as an anatomical description.............\"He's a fucking asshole.\"\n\nLastly, it has been used by many notable people throughout history:\n\n\"What the fuck was that?\" -Mayor of Hiroshima\n\n\"That's not a real fucking gun.\" -John Lennon\n\n\"Where the fuck is all this water coming from?\" -Captain of the Titanic\n\n\"Who the fuck is gonna find out?\" -Richard Nixon\n\n\"Heads are gonna fucking roll.\" -Anne Boleyn\n\n\"Any fucking idiot could answer that.\" -Albert Einstein\n\n\"It does so fucking look like her!\" -Picasso\n\n\"You want what on the fucking ceiling?\" -Michaelangelo\n\n\"Fuck a duck.\" -Walt Disney\n\n\"Houston, we have a big fucking problem.\" - The crew of Apollo 13",

Profanity has its place; that place is not everywhere (don't ask \" 'sup, motherfucker\" at a job interview). Adults should know when it appropriate (although many cannot differentiate); children do not. There are a lot of people who want to criticize parents for poor parenting skills. Part of parenting is teaching a child what is appropriate when communicating with others (and don't say it's not--I've seen too many posts on reddit criticizing a \"brat\" for making a scene in public while their parent does nothing). When profanity is used in a public arena, children accept it as appropriate everywhere. Yes, they will grow up and hear all those things; yes, they will use those words themselves. But by then, they will have learned when profanity is appropriate or not.\n\nThis isn't just a matter of profanity--the standards of communication and how to speak in different environments covers all manner of speech. You don't use the same language with your brother as you would in court. \n\nI look forward to all of the \"THINK OF THE CHILDREN\" mocking replies. Cumgurglers.",

His co-host immediately said something along the lines of \"I don't think you can say that\".. but I didn't notice any repercussions. I'm not familiar with whether or not that's actually considered swearing in Quebec (when used as a curse word - obviously it's should be fine when used for its actual meaning) - but I might expect it's just offensive to certain strict Catholics. Anyway, it's interesting to consider how allowed/not-allowed French swearing is in English broadcasts in Canada.. both inside and outside Quebec.",

It'd be more like eating with your hands in a fancy dinner or something. A breach of ettiquete, but not insulting. It reflects poorly on you as a person for not being sophisticated enough to not swear. No one actually feels insulted. And as insults get normalized and this sense of properness erodes, it becomes just normal to swear.  \nNo one feels insulted by other people swearing, though. And most of the time when you swear you're just saying exactly what everyone else thought but didn't say. So that's just nice. We're not that big on political correctness over here.\n",

    "body": "Yeah, and when folks compare to the case of what they use in France, sex-related words, there can be some vague explanation of the difference.\n\nFrance went berserk on the catholic religion after the French Revolution (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dechristianization_of_France_during_the_French_Revolution ). A few priests and catholic church men judged too strict were kicked out from professing, or just decided to run away to avoid the persecution, and some decided to cross oversea to French Canadian area. The thing was, after the territory was signed over to the British in 1763, the French Canadian area lost a few of the few priests they had already, leaving some churches and ranks empty for some time. Church control's over the local churches had already eroded a little by then anyway (at least if compared to what it was in Europe).\n\n\nSo former french priests, more strict by the standard of the time, came over and kinda cranked a notch the extremism in the religion religiously, as they kept \"enforcing the religion\" like they used to in Europe. From there on, it's mostly what I got told at school long ago, but apparently the church words were kind of reinforced with that, and made taboo more strictly and officially. As if the new priests came to the small towns, noticed folks were heathens, and slapped them in the face with some informal reform to make them more proper catholics. You savages need to respect the name of the lord more, and stuff like that. Verbal whipcrack and pressuring folks into it all. Things evolved from there on, people kept the fear of blasphemy in French Canada (\"the new priest will be pissed off\" turned into simply accepting church words as bad words).\n\n\nOne can guess that since they did not have the same slap in the face and the same renewal of the extremism, and since they kicked many priests out anyway, France just slowly had the church's meaning erode, keeping the prude taboo as the main taboo, and so sticking to sexual words until just the idea behind it remained taboo. Sex is not taboo in France now, but the words were made so, and their symbolism is just hung onto (I mean, what is so bad in saying whore? It's a job. Putain is a swearword however in France). Kinda like in the US too with Fuck and the rest\n\n\nIn French Canada however, it's like the blasphemy kept it's meaning. We had the prude taboo as well, it is to be said. Elderly people learnt from nuns at school, and there are manner of speech they use to avoid saying sex-related words. They have all euphemisms for menstruations, and in the french language, the letter Q is usually pronounced like our word for ass (cul). But older people learnt from the nuns to pronounce the letter Q differently, so they would not be saying ass when spelling out the alphabet. Though the French canadian went through a social reform in the 60's 70's and kicked the church out of school and many other places, becoming much more religion-free. So the sex taboo eroded away fast, but somehow, the stronger blasphemy taboo remained. So in French Canada, you can talk about whores without being bleeped out, but if you say Christ, you get bleeped out",
