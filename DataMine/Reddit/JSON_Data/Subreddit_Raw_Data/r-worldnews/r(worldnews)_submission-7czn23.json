Basically, their right to be treated in the same way as everyone else has been 'debated' by a bunch of straight, conservative religious bigots as though we're debating whether to give dogs the vote or something.  I know of people who have been spat on in the street by 'no' campaigners.  It's been awful.\n\nParliament is now supposed to vote based on the result to enact simple changes to the Marriage Act.  \n\nBut the next move the far right has already put in motion is to \"protect religious freedom\" by actually enacting a whole bunch of provisions to allow people to discriminate freely against gay people, because apparently the right to discriminate is more important than the right not to be discriminated against.  They are literally worried about the \"right\" of highly religious bakers to refuse to make wedding cakes for those scary, scary gay people.\n\nThis process has been fucked, but the result is a great vindication for the majority of Australians who aren't bigots.",

They can't just f their voters and pass something they didnt have a mandate for. Sure its human rights, but when the government clearly wasnt going to pass it because of a minority of hard-right Liberals holding the party ransom, a vote was the only way to get some of those hard-right Liberals to finally fold, and get it passed. Malcolm made the smart move. $100m is a waste, but i mean its a bit of a drop in the ocean when looking at the whole budget (which statistically is true - if we leave emotions out, it is a drop in the ocean). When the Labor party was in for 6-ish years, and didnt even try and pass it at all for those years, at least the left-wing part of the Liberal party has managed to almost do it now. Its a waste, but it was the best way of satisfying the Liberal voters (the ones who gave the gov't their mandate last election), as well as the opposition. I still don't understand why Labor didn't try and pass it more strongly when they were in power only 4 years ago.",

You've made it through the worst part, I believe. I'm sorry you had to go through it. It's an awful thing when other people get to decide whether you have rights.

Labor would have promised to introduce it if elected, and it obviously would have earned them alot of 'single issue voter' support. This way the liberals have dodged a major bullet.. all the while they can say to the part of their supporter base that is more conservative \"We didnt have a choice...

In Aus, people\nwill \"make jokes\" that wouldn't be said to face so casually in other countries (which I'm not trying to excuse), but 95% of people\nwill just treat you like a person after 5minutes, unlike the brick wall of suspicion, inability to see past race, etc that I've experienced elsewhere.\n\nWhen people say \"Australia [or any Western country, really] is extremely racist\"- that may make sense if you're comparing the country to some abstract ideal, but if you compare it to *other countries* (apart from maybe one or two Northern European countries or maybe Canada), then no- it's very tolerant and liberal (not that we don't still have a way to go, but let's keep some perspective.)",
