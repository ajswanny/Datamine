The people buying the horns, or the powder that they are ground into, know nothing of chemistry or active ingredients and, most likely, don't care. I think that no matter what anyone tells them, they'll want \"the real thing\", thinking that humans simply cannot make something as good as what comes from a real rhino. A better course of action would be to flood the market with it as an actual rhino horn, even though it's a counterfeit, where people won't be able to know if they're getting the real thing, which would require adding in the impurities and weathering it so that it looks like the horn of a real rhino; they should go with subterfuge.",

Even in the absence of actual safety regulations, simply ending the ban would probably result in somewhat better products due to market forces alone, as it would be easier for information to spread about which producers are reliable - though of course this is still vastly inferior to government certification. At any rate, better manufacturing might reduce a few minor safety problems but would still leave the big glaring problem of addiction or whatever other harm those drugs do in uncontrolled doses, which is why they're prohibited.",

    "body": "Then just make it legal to hunt but make the price of the license more than the price of black market ivory. I guarantee the people that live in areas with rhinos will give a whole lot more of a shit if they had a couple million dollars walking around their backyard. Annual licenses will be limited to the number of rhinos in the area that are too old to breed. Put half a million dollar price tag on \"rhinos fucking up the population\" and they will go find them with the help of rhino experts. With the license, local authorities will assist in the hunt to make sure the right rhinos are killed. \n\nLegally hunting rhinos will decrease poaching because the big game hunting market pays way more than the illegal ivory market. Also, by hunting older rhinos past the breeding age, this will inevitably increase the rhino population because the breeding aged males are killed by the old boss rhinos. The increase in rhino conservation funds will be used to save the rhinos from poaching and further study the animal. Even in areas with notoriously corrupt governments can't steal the money or spend it elsewhere because investing the funds from the licenses in rhino conservation increases the population which will lead to more licenses available. \n\nThis is exactly what Corey Knowlton did when he paid $350,000 to hunt an endangered rhino. If you are interested in animal conservation or the story of Corey Knowlton, I highly recommend this episode of the [Joe Rogan Experience Podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A1D-f_meFY) where Corey explains the details of his experience in greater detail.",

One of the reasons rhino horn fetches such a high price is because of something known as the \"anthropogenic allee effect\" in which the more rare something becomes the greater the demand because possession of it becomes a status symbol.  It's not the masses who consume the horn, it's the wealthy.  They are likely to be discerning and reject something that is fake.  If consumers don't believe that the medicinal value of horn itself is fake, why would they accept the scientific basis for the equivalence of synthetic horn?  The only way this would work is if the synthetic horn was laundered into the market, but I doubt this lab is going to get involved in such activities.",

Even a fancy gicl\u00e9e reproduction of a painting is different from the original - they're composed of different materials and there's not even a slight chance of confusing one for the other, because you can just walk up to it and see whether there are layers of paint. In contrast, a 3D printer could theoretically make a replica of a sculpture out of the same material, if it's a material that can be printed. In practice the technology is still in its infancy and there may be things a skilled scrimshander can do that a printer can't, but you could still split the difference and use the printer to start with an almost-complete piece that just needs finishing.\n\nSo if we're going to use your analogy, this is more like printing out a photo and then airbrushing it by hand, rather than use algorithms in Photoshop.\n\nEDIT: And even if there's more craft in the hand-airbrushed prints and that's very meaningful to you, Photoshop is cheaper and faster, so the market/galleries/whatever may quickly be flooded with much more cheaply produced objects that are difficult to distinguish from ones made the old-fashioned way.",
