What I think I've heard is that Catalonia has more money than Spain and sends Spain more in taxes then it gets back in benefits.

Meaning it would NOT have led to an unilateral declaration like in Catalonia. It would mostly mean that the Quebec Government would have had a solid popular backing to make demands on Canada and define exit conditions.\n\nAnd by the way, the feeling among a majority of my friends at the time about the Unity Rally was that it was complete and utter bullshit.

    "body": "> 20% of Spain\u2019s taxes, and then receive 14% back for public expenses.\n\nI always thought this ratio was about normal is it not? Kind of like where rich people get taxed more but receive the same amount of spending as everyone else.\n\nedit: Yeah apparently London provides 45% of the countries taxes but gets 35% back, isn't that the same thing with different percentages?\n\nhttp://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/news/article-2100345/Londons-taxes-prop-rest-UK-One-pound-earned-capital-funds-rest-country.html\n\nI'd wouldn't be surprised if there were many capitals or parts of countries that contribute a great amount of taxes but get fewer back spent on them. Somewhere like california would be a good example. \n\nThe whole \"you should only get what you put in\" thing is the cause of many problems imo. Like where some well off people are against government support/benefits for poorer people, or it's like saying poor people should get worse national healthcare because their taxes don't count for as much. It doesn't work like that and it shouldn't. If your richer than most then you're gonna have to deal with being taxed more money, simple as.\n\nedit: Just to add I'm just talking about the financial side of it, nothing about their points that they're culturally very different than the rest of the country so they don't have representation on that front.",
