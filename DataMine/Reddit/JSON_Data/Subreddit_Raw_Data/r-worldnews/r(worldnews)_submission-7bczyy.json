    "body": "The way it is currently shaking out is exactly how a conservative would want to see it. \n\nThe federal government is not involved. Federal taxpayer money is not being sent to foreign countries. States and private industry are addressing a problem, choosing their levels of commitment financially and philosophically while being much greater than federal minimum levels.\n\nStates are acting autonomously to improve within their means above federal minimum standards. And private industries feel they are being instructed by the market that it is superior to be green.\n\nThe funny thing is watching Reddit being extremely conflicted on this matter. \n\nYes climate change is a problem and should be taken seriously. At the same time I feel a lot of people are simply jumping in support of this agreement without even knowing what it is, or how potentially conflicting it could be for any future agreement that actually genuinely wants to tackle the root causes of climate change. \n\nHere is the actual agreement:\n\nhttp://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2015/cop21/eng/l09r01.pdf \n\n*(fixed link to actual PDF, what I had before was a summary)\n\nThe Paris Agreement has several major issues:\n\n**No actual accountability**\n\nThe actual agreement allows countries to custom form their own reduction goals, and then it provides absolutely no enforcement mechanism to ensure they actually reach those goals. It completely ignores the world's main polluter and future economic jaggernaut, which is China. In the current agreement, China doesn't even have to cut anything until 2030, despite generating more pollution than all EU countries and America put together. Currently China [accounts for nearly 70% of all emission increases in the last 2 decades.](http://www.pbl.nl/en/publications/trends-in-global-co2-emissions-2015-report) \n\nIt places no actual demands on the third world, despite the fact that the total global CO2 emissions from the developing) world is set to catapult up to 85% of the total global emissions by 2050, [with the developing world accounting for only 15%.](https://globalchange.mit.edu/publications/signature/2015-energy-and-climate-outlook)\n\nThis ineffectivness is reflected in the various studies, which estimate that it will reduce the average temperature by 0.6 to 1.1 degree C over the next century at the most optimistic, way less than the stated goal:\n\n\n>Implementation of the Paris Agreement will lead to a temperature rise between 2.7 and 3.6C, far exceeding the 2C goal. That\u2019s the main conclusion from new results of the MIT Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change.\n\n>Assuming a climate system response to anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions that\u2019s of median strength, the three scenarios reduce the SAT in 2100 between 0.6 and 1.1\u00b0 C relative to the \u201cno climate policy\u201d case. But because the climate system takes many years to respond to emissions reductions, in 2050 the SAT falls by only about 0.1\u00b0 C in all three cases. \n\nSource: [Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)](http://energypost.eu/mit-study-paris-agreement-sets-world-course-3c-temperature-rise-end-century/) \n\n\n>The climate impact of all Paris INDC promises is minuscule: if we measure the impact of every nation fulfilling every promise by 2030, the total temperature reduction will be 0.048\u00b0C (0.086\u00b0F) by 2100.\n\n>Even if we assume that these promises would be extended for another 70 years, there is still little impact: if every nation fulfills every promise by 2030, and continues to fulfill these promises faithfully until the end of the century, and there is no \u2018CO\u2082 leakage\u2019 to non-committed nations, the entirety of the Paris promises will reduce temperature rises by just 0.17\u00b0C (0.306\u00b0F) by 2100.\n\n[Source: Durham University's Global Policy Journal](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1758-5899.12295/full)\n\n\n\n**It requires billions in transfer payments to the poorly regulated third world countries without any enforcement**\n\nThis agreement asks for $100 billion a year MINIMUM to be transfered from the developed world to the developing world by 2020, the lionshare being paid by the US, with \"significantly increasing adaptation finance from current levels \". The countries that would receive this money are not accountable in terms of how its spent. They could literally just build a machine that takes coals and spits out pollution without any utility whatsoever and it would be perfectly in accord with the agreement. The third world is not known for their governance structures leading to positive outcomes when handed money without accountability, so why should now be any different?\n\nThis money could be used for real actual emission reducing projects, rather than being handed over to third world dictators without any guarantees on whether any actual climate change projects will be followed through. Even worse its giving money to our biggest economic rivals, for example China and India, at a time when they are set to potentially overcome the US economically.\n\nThe US is far from the pariah when it come to climate change, it absolutely [dominates when it comes to climate change research funds](https://www.relx.com/~/media/Files/R/RELX-Group/documents/responsibility/policies/climate-change-science) and does so in every category. [We have been reducing our emissions in terms of both per dollar GDP and per capita for decades](https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/styles/large/public/2016-07/us-ghg-emissions-download3-2016.png). \n\nThis entire agreement is a practice in political PR for elected officials, a means of obtaining politically positive optics to the masses that don't actually read the details of these agreements. Its like TPP, it sounds very nice when the newspapers describe it, until you actually read what the agreement says. Even worse it gives everyone an excuse in the future to say \"Well we already have the Paris Agreement, we're dealing with the problem\" while not actually addressing it at all.\n\nWe need a genuine framework that sets goals that reachable by enforceable targets for the world's worst polluters, with clear financial punishments if said goals are not reached and a framework to ensure all centralized funds go into real projects rather than ending up in the pockets of contract companies that are buddies with people like Xi Jinping. But instead with this we would be handing over billions to the poorly regulated and largest polluting countries without any framework leverage to ensure compliance, we would allow the world's largest polluter and authoritarian state to pollute until 2030 at hearts content, while at the same time punishing the well regulated developed world which has strong accountability and would actually use the money for climate change projects. \n\nSo how exactly is that saving the planet? \n\n",

If the above scenarios do turn out to be accurate, then we could see an exponential increase in warming / feedback loops that result in us turning in to an uninhabitable ball of warm farts.

The huge problem with the agreement is that someone like North Korea, who is a part of it, can set renewable energy goals and then just set on them without consequence.  They can literally do nothing and part of the money The States would be sending out would go to them.  They could then take OUR own money and use it to develop a ICBM to strike us.  \n\nThere isn\u2019t penalty or anything compelling these countries to meet their goals.  It just looks good to be part of it.\n\nThe more I look at it the more it appears to merely be a distribution of wealth.\n\nDonald Trump was right. I hate to say it, but he was.  We don\u2019t need an agreement to make these changes.  I\u2019m not directly quoting him here, but he basically said \u201call of you who want to make these changes have never needed the government holding your hand to do so.  If you want renewable energy then no one is holding you back.\u201d  Look what happened when Trump pulled out of the Accord.  The last time I checked, which was a very long time ago, over 4 trillion dollars of the US economy (States, cities, businesses, corporations, etc.) have pledged to switch to renewable and fulfill the Accord...except now the US isn\u2019t sending money out to countries like North Korea.\n\nIts kind of funny actually.

Turns out it's only done by Euro spec on paper. It's missing a lot of technology it's supposed to have. It's emitting odors, they've found the plant has no sulfur filters, it's not completing the anaerobic process of converting the cow manure properly and may be causing microbiological contamination with ecoli and other microbes. They're finding heavy metals as well. \n\nLocals also report seeing truck dumping at people's farm land and farmers say truckers often tell them they should be thankful to get cow manure for free when other people are paying for it\n\nBasically, someone got 6 mil euro money to build this plant, spent 2 million putting up and kept the other 4 million",

However it was pretty quickly rolled back, because folks around here just [couldn't handle it](https://www.joc.com/metric-road-signs-eyesores-alabama-senate-decides_19970225.html).\n\nEDIT: Evidently there's an inconsistent paywall behind the link, so here's the text:\n\n>The Alabama Senate has decided that metric signs along state roadways are eyesores that offend drivers accustomed to driving miles rather than kilometers.\n\n>The Senate voted 31-0 last week for a bill by Sen. Jack Biddle that would reverse the state Transportation Department's conversion to the metric system.The bill now goes to the House for consideration.\n\n>Sen. Biddle and other senators said their constituents are upset about kilometer signs the Transportation Department has erected along major highways.\n\n>''When those signs started going up in my district, I couldn't go to the coffee shop. They wanted to know, 'How dumb are you in Montgomery?' '' said Sen. Gerald Dial, D-Lineville, referring to the Statehouse.\n\n>Mr. Biddle's bill would require the Transportation Department to do all road and bridge projects in traditional measurements and it would require that mile markers stay up along Alabama highways.\n\n>The kilometer markers that are already in place could remain, but no more could go up. And mile markers would have to be maintained, he said.\n",

As was said, despite Trump pulling out of the agreement many companies and states are seeking to meet or exceed these decreases in pollution. \n\n**A government mandate is not always the best solution.** People being reliant on the government is a bad thing.

It's possible, not saying it will but it could happen, that within another decade companies in America let the standard slip without a force to oversee them, and then we're all sucking up smog like China going \"Why did we fire the guys that were supposed to stop this again?\"\n\nAgain, I'm not saying that's for sure, and I like to believe the best in people, but it's pretty well known that companies in particular respond better to punishments than rewards, especially if the reward isn't cold cash.

This is the same as the US - and the reason is that the old measurements weren't standardised, and actually varied from place to place (not just UK vs US, but even different states in the US could be some small % different).

The way I heard it, soda came mostly in cans or glass bottles at the time and Pepsi was looking for a better way to package more soda at once, since their market research had revealed most families ran out of Pepsi too quickly (or something, it sounds weird when I type it). At the time whatever plastic they use in those bottles had just been invented so Pepsi took advantage of the new technology to bottle 2Ls at a time. Why 2L? Cause at the time America was in the middle of its switch-to-metric craze and 2L was a gimmick to take advantage of that. It stuck!",
