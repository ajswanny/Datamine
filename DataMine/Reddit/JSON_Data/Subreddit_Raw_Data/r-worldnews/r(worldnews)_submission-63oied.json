Enraptured by Obama's chocolate six pack, oil dripping down to his speedo, covering up a bulge that made Putin stand at attention.\n\nObama got all the ladies, it made Putin so angry to think Obama's long spear would never penetrate his Siberian tundra. How could Obama only want women? They were catty and mean, not like Putin, he's a gentle lover. All Putin needed was just one kiss, tongues intertwined, and Obama would join Putin in his bed.\n\nJust once he wished he could be embraced by Obama, feeling the 9 inches of uncut justice in his hands. Putin imagined the feeling of the pulsating member in his hands, so large he could barely reach all the way around, slippery with lust. A long kiss would finish the night as they cuddled and watched bears riding tricycles.\n\n\"Mr. Putin?\" The announcer snapped Putin out of his fantasy.\n\n\"Da?\" Replied Putin.\n\n\"This guy is the best, believe me,\" Said the orange announcer. \"He's the best President ever, I know a lot of people that say it.\"\n\nThe orange man motioned for Putin to walk over and Putin stood next to him. Putin didn't listen as the orange man spoke, he wanted to collapse on stage. The previous night the orange man cornered Putin in the bathroom and had his way with him. He couldn't do anything, frozen in fear as the rotting and dark blue penis slapped across his face. He prayed Obama would walk in and save him, carry him out and show him the love he deserved. But it didn't happen, the orange man finished and gave Putin a kiss. Putin sat in the stall crying, men stood outside the stall laughing at the man turned into a baby.\n\nPutin felt the cold claw of a demon grabbing his perfect ass, breaking him out of the thoughts of the sexual assault. The corpsey breath of the orange man fell on his ear. \"We're gonna have fun tonight bitch, drink lots of water and make sure you have to piss bigly.\" A single tear ran down Putin's face, everybody thought he was crying because he won, nobody could know he is a weak little boy unable to fend off an elderly Cheeto brought to life.\n\nPutin looked back to Obama. Obama raised an eye brow and nodded, he knew what was happening. Obama did judge him, a fire in his eyes told Putin that tonight was going to be different. There was going to be a happy ending tonight, maybe in more ways than one.\n     ",

He believed education was vital so he set up universities and championed the arts and sciences, as well as building roads and hospitals throughout France. The Napoleonic Code inspired many modern constitutions and set the groundwork for some of the most important ideas in western society. Beyond that, he was a brilliant general and tactician the likes of which are seen once in 1,000 years; his tactics are still studied today. Plus there was that time he kidnapped the Pope and crowned himself emperor, that was pretty cool. What has Putin done?\n\nTL;DR - Putin sucks, Napoleon rules",
