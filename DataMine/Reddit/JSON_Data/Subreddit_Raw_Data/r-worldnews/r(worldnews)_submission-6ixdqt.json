In many African countries for instance, you'll find Confucius Institutes, which sole purpose is to spread Chinese culture and language to the native population. \n\nThe Western world also give a lot of money to the same countries (through IMF and the sort) but with strict strings attached and expectations, which China exploits to look like the good guy. \n\nAn interesting tactic imo. \n\nEdit: Some sources \n\n[On Chinese Aid](https://www.dropbox.com/s/w1f87k3ojl6vlnt/Brautigam.pdf?dl=0)\n\n[On Chinese Aid to Africa](https://www.dropbox.com/s/unebl9b9zs7fold/Strange%20et%20al%202015.pdf?dl=0)\n\n[On the lack of data on Chinese funding and aid](https://www.dropbox.com/s/lmvdn7w72smregq/Strange%2C%20Parks%2C%20Fuchs%2C%20Dreher_2015.pdf?dl=0)\n\n[On (IMF) Aid for UNSC votes](https://www.dropbox.com/s/m1ofxv34ya4ypxf/Dreher%2C%20%20Sturm%2C%20%20Raymond%202009_JDE.pdf?dl=0)\n\n[More on Aid for votes](https://www.dropbox.com/s/4z7joa9v7ugxy4r/Kuziemko%20%26%20Werker.pdf?dl=0)\n\n\n",

McDonald's, Wal-Mart and Mars earned the report's top scores. They have made public commitments to buying from suppliers that have pledged to raise cattle on land that hasn't been freshly cleared.\"\n\nSo, a big thing you can do to protect the Amazon is to eat less beef, and when you *do,* try to purchase locally-sourced meats, and avoid companies which haven't committed to deforestation-free beef. You can also contact those laggard companies and urge them to make a public commitment to only buy beef from deforestation-free suppliers -- it only takes a few minutes, but it can make a big difference. I've linked to each corporation's contact forms in the quote above, so it's easy to do.",

    "body": "You're seriously underestimating how much Prosecutors make here, as well as the recent efforts employed against corruption. The former governor of Rio de Janeiro State, for example (the one who was in charge when Rio de Janeiro City was chosen to host the olympics), can be seen in [this photo](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTAz_-ZWNFBVkuJafcq0Oc_HPVBh-gcX2qjdEdf8IwIRCGt4uhIZ9eEfh2D) being escorted to his new home at a State public jail, facing 11 charges (and counting) from passive corruption to money laundering.\n\nThe Prosecutor General is also *the person* who requested an official police investigation into the President. A request that was approved by the Supreme Court. I won't be stupid to the point of denying that corruption in the Prosecutor's Office and the Judiciary exists here, but our system is structured in a way that makes it complicated, as judges and prosecutors are selected not by election, but by their knowledge of the law, though difficult and highly competitive public examination (think civil service exams, but composed of 5 different tests, where you are competing with 200 to 1000 people per vacancy, and you need a bare minimum score of 85% just to get on the waiting list). Also, don't quote me on this, but from what I heard from my law professors, Brazilian judges earn even more then American ones, which serves to keep the number of competitors high.\n\nEdit: If anyone is curious and wants to learn some *jurisdiqu\u00eas* (Brazilian legalese), you can see the official request to open the investigation on President Temer and the subsequent Court decisions [here](http://s.conjur.com.br/dl/inq-4483-fachin.pdf). There was also a case in the Superior Electoral Court, known as *A\u00e7\u00e3o de Investiga\u00e7\u00e3o Judicial Eleitoral* (AIJE) 1943-58, where the losing party in the 2014 elections seeked to annul Dilma's and Temer's electoral mandates over abuse of political and economic power. The full record is available online [here](http://www.tse.jus.br/eleicoes/eleicoes-anteriores/eleicoes-2014/prestacao-de-contas-eleicoes-2014/acao-de-investigacao-judicial-eleitoral-no-1943-58), but good luck downloading anything in less than 20 minutes. The case was tried two weeks ago and was dismissed on a 4x3 ruling, though both the losing party and the Electoral Prosecutor's Office said they would file what's known as an \"extraordinary appeal\" (*recurso extraordin\u00e1rio*) to the Supreme Court, which is possible when the Court decision violates the Constitution. I'm curious to see how that will end.",

Combine that with the mass marketing of multi-billionaire corporations and it's a lost cause. \n\n The government is already tight with food stamps which makes it cost prohibitive to eat healthy. \n\nI'm all for sustainability but it's such a complex issue. Look at our food banks. They only accept non perishable canned goods, i.e. high in sodium/sugar and low on nutritional value. It's a viscous cycle among the poor and lower working class. No access to affordable healthy foods and little education on how to eat healthy.

But if she didn't have such a low support from the population (less than 10%!), if she didn't change so fast the country's policies after election compared to the promises she made during her campaign, and if her party had elected more Congressmen and Senators, the opposition wouldn't have been able to push the impeachment process forward.\n\nImagine, for example, that Senate and Congress was controlled by Democrats in the US instead of Republicans. Probably there would already be an impeachment process going around by this time against Trump, considering the accusations he has been getting.",
