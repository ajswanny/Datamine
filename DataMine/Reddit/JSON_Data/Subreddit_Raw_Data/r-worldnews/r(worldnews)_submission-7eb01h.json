    "body": "For the record: the Catholic church has never denied climate change or evolution, the Vatican has a research lab (I think for astrophysics) and for a long time has maintained an academy of very prominent scientists including a slew of Nobel laureates to advise the church on scientific matters, especially related to social issues like public health. Also, everyone or almost everyone in the clergy has at least a master's degree. (Sometimes you do seven straight years of divinity but a lot of people like to get degrees in something else before moving on to the seminary. Biology is a popular choice. Though seven straight years of divinity is nothing to sneeze at either.)\n\nThe people pushing for Creationism in schools and other such anti-intellectual nonsense are evangelicals, they have nothing to do with the Vatican. Catholicism's relationship with science, philosophy, and the intelligentsia in general is fascinating and complex, but as it stands the church is firmly pro-science.",

    "body": "About the CBS news article: I am disappointed that they did not link the actual letter written by Pope Francis, and chose to only link to other CBS articles. Here it is, in it's entirety:\n\nExcellency,\n\nNearly two years ago, the international community gathered within this UNFCCC forum, with most of its highest government representatives, and after a long and complex debate arrived at the adoption of the historic Paris Agreement. It saw the achievement of consensus on the need to launch a shared strategy to counteract one of the most worrying phenomena our humanity is experiencing: climate change.\n\nThe will to follow this consensus was highlighted by the speed with which the Paris Agreement entered into force, less than a year after its adoption.\n\nThe Agreement indicates a clear path of transition to a low- or zero-carbon model of economic development, encouraging solidarity and leveraging the strong links between combating climate change and poverty. This transition is further solicited by the climatic urgency that requires greater commitment from the countries, some of which must endeavour to take a leading role in this transition, bearing in mind the needs of the most vulnerable populations.\n\nThese days you are gathered in Bonn to carry out another important phase of the Paris Agreement: the process of defining and constructing guidelines, rules and institutional mechanisms so that it may be truly effective and capable of contributing to the achievement of the complex objectives it proposes. In such a path, it is necessary to maintain a high level of cooperation.\n\nFrom this perspective, I would like to reaffirm my urgent call to renew dialogue on how we are building the future of the planet. We need an exchange that unites us all, because the environmental challenge we are experiencing, and its human roots, regards us all, and affects us all. [...] Unfortunately, many efforts to seek concrete solutions to the environmental crisis are often frustrated for various reasons ranging from denial of the problem to indifference, comfortable resignation, or blind trust in technical solutions (cf. Encyclical Laudato si\u2019, 14).\nWe should avoid falling into the trap of these four perverse attitudes, which certainly do not help honest research or sincere and productive dialogue on building the future of our planet: denial, indifference, resignation and trust in inadequate solutions.\n\nMoreover, we cannot limit ourselves only to the economic and technological dimension: technical solutions are necessary but not sufficient; it is essential and desirable to carefully consider the ethical and social impacts and impacts of the new paradigm of development and progress in the short, medium and long term.\n\nFrom this perspective, it is increasingly necessary to pay attention to education and lifestyles based on an integral ecology, capable of taking on a vision of honest research and open dialogue where the various dimensions of the Paris Agreement are intertwined. It is useful to remember that the Agreement recalls the \u201cgrave \u2026 ethical and moral responsibility to act without delay, in a manner as free as possible from political and economic pressures, setting aside particular interests and behaviour\u201d (cf. Message to COP-22). This means, in effect, propagating a \u201cresponsible awareness\u201d towards our common home (cf. Encyclical Laudato si\u2019, 202; 231) through the contribution of all, in explaining the different forms of action and partnership between the various stakeholders, some of whom do not lack to highlight the ingenuity of the human being in favour of the common good.\n\nWhile I send my greetings to you, Mr President, and to all the participants in this Conference, I hope that, with your authoritative guidance and that of the Fiji Islands, the work of these days will be inspired by the same collaborative and prophetic spirit manifested during the COP-21. This will enable an acceleration of awareness-raising and consolidate the will to make effective decisions to counteract the phenomenon of climate change while at the same time fighting poverty and promoting true human development as a whole. This commitment is supported by the wise providence of God Most High.\n\nvia http://en.radiovaticana.va/news/2017/11/16/pope_francis_sends_letter_to_cop23_climate_conference_in_bon/1349337/\n\nwhich is down right now; accessed through internet archive:\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20171117015206/http://en.radiovaticana.va/news/2017/11/16/pope_francis_sends_letter_to_cop23_climate_conference_in_bon/1349337/",

I respect him immensely and I am pretty sure he liked me.  She was telling me that during one of his homilies, he was saying that we, (not sure if we as in catholic church) need atheists. You have to question things and not accept things blindly, even faith.\n\nNow I didn\u2019t hear it myself, and she was paraphrasing him, so it might have been just how she interpreted what he was saying.\n\nEven as an atheist, I feel more welcomed by the catholic church.

At first, the cause is a facet of their faith, and their involvement in the cause is a way to live out their faith.\n\nThen they become more and more enthusiastic about serving this cause. Over time, their dedication to the cause is greater than their dedication to their faith. They will take actions they know to be sinful in order to serve the cause.\n\nWhen it gets to this point, the cause no longer serves their faith. Instead the faith ends up serving the cause. \n\nThis is what has happened with the bishops you describe. They are willing to support policies of discrimination and abuse of the poor just for the faintest hint of hope that the politician will say something symbolic to support their anti-abortion position. They are willing to support clear and present heinous crimes against humanity (discrimination, bad healthcare, torture, war) just because it comes with a 2% chance that Planned Parenthood will lose a bit of funding.\n\nThey have put the cart before the horse in a terrible way.",

    "body": "This is obfuscating the issue. If Pope Francis intends that his teaching be understood that divorced and remarried Catholics can receive communion, he is flatly contradicting infallible *de fide* teaching on the sacrament of marriage. Jesus unambiguously taught that the sacrament of marriage is indissoluble and the Church has always publicly affirmed this, until now. A civil marriage involving a previously married party is not a valid Catholic marriage. If one is in a divorce and remarriage situation and not abstaining from sexual relations, it is a de facto excommunication and one must go to confession and abstain from sexual relations to be reconciled with the Church. This cannot and will not change. It's equivalent to saying that you don't need confess your sins to be absolved in the confessional or you don't need to use water to baptise. It fundamentally contradicts the nature of the sacrament. \n\nIt's not evil reactionaries vs. nice Pope, it's the Church through the efforts of four Cardinals demanding the Pope to explain himself and if he is attempting to change moral teaching, which has zero authority to change, vs. a Pope who refuses to answer simple questions and gives tacit support to bishops who reject Church teaching.\n\nIt's got nothing to do with being \"accommodating\" or \"modern\", it's about demanding answers from someone who looks like they're trying to do the equivalent of repealing the Magna Carta. His being the Pope does not give him authority to change the foundations of Catholicism, which are the teachings of Jesus. If he is in fact attempting to do this, he must be formally corrected by the Church. If he does not accept the formal correction, he can in fact be removed from office and his teachings anathematized. Popes have been formally corrected before as well as anathematized after their deaths for teaching heretical views (important to note: not in their role as Pope but as private theologians), but a deposition of a living Pope has never occurred. The logistics for doing it were established during the Counter-Reformation in case a Pope converted to Protestantism.",

That's a very weak picture of God which isn't compelling at all.\n\nNo reasonable Catholic believes this. Instead what they say is that God is the grounds of all ability to know and is the grounds of  existence so that all things can exist and can be known, meaning that he is present everywhere and actively makes the universe comprehensible by the human mind.\n\nYou're definitely right in saying, however, that there is a marked difference between Catholicism and Evangelicalism, particularly of it's highly fundamentalist or hyper-conservative forms. They basically decry any scientific that doesn't fit in with a particular reading of the Bible (which I think is a demonstrably poor reading).",

On the plus side, we also have a few politicians going in the exact opposite direction with a bit of steam behind them (Jagmeet Singh is legit as fuck, and will certainly have my vote in the next election barring any shenanigans), so for the moment I remain hopeful. Also I think that seeing all the fuckery to have come out of the Trump administration will serve as an effective warning for us to keep our own house in order, so thanks for that I guess.

When the Pope makes or writes an official statement regarding the faith it\u2019s taken as canon.\n\nNotes from Canon Lawyer:\n\nHe can speak infallibly on issues of faith and morals. There is no special formula for making an infallible statement, but he must make it clear for it to be binding (we can't be bound by what we don't know).\n\nIn most cases, if the Pope is doing something infallibly he's not doing it on his own. That's rare. He's normally doing it with the bishops in an ecumenical council.\n\nI'm sorry, I misunderstood what you were saying. I think I was linked to a later part of the conversation. Yes, he can speak infallibly on issues of faith and morals. There is no special formula for making an infallible statement, but he must make it clear for it to be binding (we can't be bound by what we don't know).\n\n>Canon 749.\t\u00a71. By virtue of his office, the Supreme Pontiff possesses infallibility in teaching when as the supreme pastor and teacher of all the Christian faithful, who strengthens his brothers and sisters in the faith, he proclaims by definitive act that a doctrine of faith or morals is to be held. \n\n>\u00a72. The college of bishops also possesses infallibility in teaching when the bishops gathered together in an ecumenical council exercise the magisterium as teachers and judges of faith and morals who declare for the universal Church that a doctrine of faith or morals is to be held definitively; or when dispersed throughout the world but preserving the bond of communion among themselves and with the successor of Peter and teaching authentically together with the Roman Pontiff matters of faith or morals, they agree that a particular proposition is to be held definitively. \n\n>\u00a73. No doctrine is understood as defined infallibly unless this is manifestly evident.\n",

For example, the infallible proclamation of the Immaculate Conception reads as follows:\n\n>We declare, pronounce and define that the doctrine which holds that the Blessed Virgin Mary, at the first instant of her conception, by a singular privilege and grace of the Omnipotent God, in virtue of the merits of Jesus Christ, the Saviour of mankind, was preserved immaculate from all stain of original sin, has been revealed by God, and therefore should firmly and constantly be believed by all the faithful.\n\nHere, the Pope is \n1. Exercising the authority of his office,\n2. Defining a dogma regarding the Faith (or morals),\n3. binding the belief of the dogma to all the faithful.\n\nAll three of those elements are required for an infallible proclamation. Since Papal infallibility has been defined as a dogma, it has only been exercised twice--once in 1854 (declaring the immaculate conception), and one in the 1950s (declaring the assumption of Mary). There are a few other times in history we can pinpoint as well, before the dogma was formally defined.",

    "body": "From most weight to least weight according to canon law:\n\n>Canon 750.\t\u00a71. A person must believe with divine and Catholic faith all those things contained in the word of God, written or handed on, that is, in the one deposit of faith entrusted to the Church, and at the same time proposed as divinely revealed either by the solemn magisterium of the Church or by its ordinary and universal magisterium which is manifested by the common adherence of the Christian faithful under the leadership of the sacred magisterium; therefore all are bound to avoid any doctrines whatsoever contrary to them. \n\n>\u00a72. Each and every thing which is proposed definitively by the magisterium of the Church concerning the doctrine of faith and morals, that is, each and every thing which is required to safeguard reverently and to expound faithfully the same deposit of faith, is also to be firmly embraced and retained; therefore, one who rejects those propositions which are to be held definitively is opposed to the doctrine of the Catholic Church.\n\n>Canon 751.\tHeresy is the obstinate denial or obstinate doubt after the reception of baptism of some truth which is to be believed by divine and Catholic faith; apostasy is the total repudiation of the Christian faith; schism is the refusal of submission to the Supreme Pontiff or of communion with the members of the Church subject to him.\n\n>Canon 752.\tAlthough not an assent of faith, a religious submission of the intellect and will must be given to a doctrine which the Supreme Pontiff or the college of bishops declares concerning faith or morals when they exercise the authentic magisterium, even if they do not intend to proclaim it by definitive act; therefore, the Christian faithful are to take care to avoid those things which do not agree with it.\n\n>Canon 753.\tAlthough the bishops who are in communion with the head and members of the college, whether individually or joined together in conferences of bishops or in particular councils, do not possess infallibility in teaching, they are authentic teachers and instructors of the faith for the Christian faithful entrusted to their care; the Christian faithful are bound to adhere with religious submission of mind to the authentic magisterium of their bishops.\n\n>Canon 754.\tAll the Christian faithful are obliged to observe the constitutions and decrees which the legitimate authority of the Church issues in order to propose doctrine and to proscribe erroneous opinions, particularly those which the Roman Pontiff or the college of bishops puts forth.\n\n*Laudato si* and accompanying statements are likely 754's and just general moral teachings, though it may not even be a 754; there would be debate there. A Catholic could legitimately disagree with the Pope about something like global warming (certainly as to the scientific aspects of it, of which the Church and the Pope have no special charism), but he must do so respectfully, always listening to and trying to understand the Holy Father. Teaching on global warming is certainly not infallibly declared, nor is it part of the ordinary universal magisterium. You might argue that \"caring about God's creation\" is part of infallible teaching, being part of the ordinary universal magisterium, but someone who disagrees with the Pope on global warming likely already assents to that teaching. They just disagree as to the *how* it should be done and the specifics of the problem.\n\n/u/Hurrah_for_Karamazov",
