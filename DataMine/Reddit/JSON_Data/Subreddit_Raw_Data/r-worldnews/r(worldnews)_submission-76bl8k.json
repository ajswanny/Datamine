    "body": "oh boy, my time to shine. Not a penguin, but I am a lobsterman and have to deal with seagulls all the time. Anyways, I have been doing it for 5 or 6 years now and last year the company that provides our entire port with bait for our traps changed the type of bait they buy after it had stayed the same for as long as I can remember. I remember it being the same even when I was a kid 8 or 9 years ago. For nearly the totality of the company's existence, the company sold us [herring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herring#/media/File:Herring_catch-Sep200.jpg), but now they sell us the detached heads or [Acadian redfish from Icelandic waters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acadian_redfish#/media/File:Sebastes_fasciatus.png). The problem is that seagulls love herring, its gummy and soft and the bones are thin and also soft, compared the the 90% bone skull of the Acadian redfish. The only thing the seagulls can eat out of these heads are the fish's eyes. This has, by definition, decimated the seagull population. Before there would be a crowd of over 30 seagulls. At the start of this summer, at least we would have 3 or 4. Now, in October, we are lucky to have 2. Also I just found out that Acadian redfish are endangered and are likely to go extinct. It is hard to believe we can be this wasteful. We are sending a species towards extinction and destroying the local population of another and can't even use the body of the Acadian redfish. I'm not even an environmentalist and I can see this is awful. There just isn't any reason for it.\n\nEdit: You guys have a lot of questions about this trade. So do a lot of tourists. Maybe I should start an AMA?",

The problem is that the same people who do the most damage to the climate and deny that it's happening are also stymieing the progress we need to fix the damage. \n\nThey oppose GMOs when we could use those principles to engineer better crops that could overcome many of the problems faced or even possibly someday \"terraform\" the earth and bring back species driven to the edge or completely into extinction. They oppose research into abundant cheap alternative energy that we could use to power projects to fix things that wouldn't be economically feasible now while also cutting down emissions immensely. They oppose space exploration even with everything to gained from it.\n\nAnd I'm not just talking about the right. I've seen plenty of people on the left who shy away from GMOs, or think nuclear energy isn't worth it, or that there's no real point in space exploration. \n\nIt just baffles me that so many people oppose technological progress that's so necessary. Especially the people who preach about climate change. If we're not already past the tipping point, we will be far before we stop making it worse. Just \"going green\" isn't enough \u2013 we're going to have to go all in and start actively repairing the damage done. Obviously it's better to not burn you house down in the first place, but after it gets to a certain point, stopping throwing fuel on the fire isn't going to be nearly enough; you're going to need to actively fight the fire ans then look towards repairing the damage the fire did.\n\nSorry about going off on a tangent. I just get annoyed at all the people on Reddit who circlejerk complaining about damage done to the climate without looking at what needs to be done to actually fix the issues.",

I don't know how quickly they have diversified in the past, but as they exist today they succeed in extremely narrow environmental conditions.\n\nThink about emperor penguins. They are incredibly specific in their behavior and morphology. They have given up nesting, they have given up most competition for space. They have given up a lot of typical characteristic to live in a very specific place in a very specific way. \n\nAt one point they were likely much more normal penguins, and as the ice changed they moved further and further over ice to get to their breeding grounds. The ones who were bigger could store more fat and more partially digested food for their chicks.\n\nThe smaller ones did not succeed, just like you're seeing in this colony. They also had to adjust their cycles to keep a bigger chick alive to maturity, they had to develop social solutions to the storms, so they huddle and gave up nesting.\n\nThe emperor penguins likely had a longer time to adjust to climatic conditions, so the penguins might not be able to survive these climatic changes we are seeing.",

It also makes them reliant on humans for food. \n\nOur only chance is trying to increase the amount of naturally available food for them by eliminating commerical fishing in our oceans or magically stopping global warming. Neither is very likely unfortunately.",

I recently started avoiding beef more than I used to (I think I was inspired by a recent study suggesting that we could [easily meet](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2017/08/if-everyone-ate-beans-instead-of-beef/535536/)  emissions reduction targets if everybody chose to eat beans instead of beef). I didn't cut it out because I love it, but I dialed it down a little, and I started incorporating tofu/tempeh/whatever into meals here and there. Once I settle at this new normal I might reduce my consumption of other meats a bit--again, without the goal of ever eliminating it entirely, because I love to travel and try local foods, and also because I consider meat-based dishes to by an important part of my own cultural identity.\n\nThe discourse around responsible food consumption is really weird and gatekeepery.  Imagine if there was a movement that said if you want to help the environment, you have to never use a car again, and if you drive one time then you broke your streak and you're not a real non-car-ian.  Thank God that what we have instead is a movement that says, \"If you ride your bike to work a day or two a week then great job, everything helps!\" \n\nInstead of the whole us vs. them mentality that seems to pervade the whole carnivores vs. vegans dynamic, I feel like it would be good to push for a more inclusive discourse that relies on encouraging large numbers of people to make small, possibly progressive dietary changes, instead of relying on the advocacy of a smaller group of true believers to promote total animal product abstinence or whatever.\n\n**tl;dr: If you feel guilty, try eating a little less high-carbon-footprint foods like beef, but don't feel like you gotta give that shit up entirely, everything helps.**",

This for the simple reason that each individual user will do what is best for himself, rather than what is best for everyone. \n\nElinor's research shows a different view. She studied how people in small communities around the world managed common resources. Her research showed that when natural resources are pooled and have shared ownership, the rules for managing those resources evolves over time in a way both economically and ecologically sustainable. Elinor therefore believed that common pooled ownership of natural resources is better than privatization and government involvement. A prerequisite however being that decision-making be transparent and democratic.\"\n\nhttps://www.nobelprize.org/educational/nobelprize_info/ostrom-edu.html",

This entails seeing animal products as inherently unethical. Hence, it would not make sense to be amenable to some exploitation of animals in the form of reducing intake of animal products without having the ultimate goal as eliminating such products from one's consumption entirely. Supporting the animal agriculture industry means supporting an industry that causes a great deal of harm to animals which would not sit right with ethical vegans. It's something like how a person would not be okay with a little rape; although more rape is worse, any amount of rape is still bad and undesirable. Since dairy cows are quite literally raped through artificial insemination in order to continually produce milk, I suppose this is an apt analogy. \n\nFrom an environmental perspective, on the other hand, it may not necessarily be seen as absolutist. Any amount of reduction would be positive although it still doesn't really make sense given how much ecological harm the decision to consume an animal product would make. The documentary Cowspiracy does a great job explaining this. ",

(Dear Vegans, some places pay more. pls dont be mad.)\n\nWhat I do to try to help is buy ethically sourced products when I can. So, if you're going to treat yourself to a new wallet, you can find some amazing luxury ones that are vegan or ethically sourced. For people who love camping, you can get a lot of camping and outdoor gear from United By Blue and for every item you buy they remove a pound of garbage from the ocean.\n\nFor food, it depends on your income and where you live/how much you work. That said, your local farmers and farmers market should have ethically sourced produce and meat. You can even take a nice drive through your nearby farm area and look for signs or if you're feeling friendly and see someone outside, approach them to see if they sell their meat. This is how my dad sold our chickens every year 10 yrs ago but a lot of farmers still work that way. You can also look on facebook groups, varagesale, kijiji or craigslist ? and see if you can arrange for them to deliver the meat for you on a regular basis.\n\nWhen you buy a new car, get one with good mileage or go hybrid. Maybe grow some spinach in your window for fun! You can also look at electric consumption when purchasing new appliances or electronics. It's a good idea for your electric bill anyways! And finally, solar panels are great. If you can afford them, they can help shave a significant amount of money off your monthly expenses!",
