Only then, in the last decade or so, has video footage emerged from the Friendship Games, and when you compare the Soviet level of gymnastics with the American, well, we say that she has an asterisks next to her gold medal for a reason.\n\nEDIT for clarity: Sorry I'm a bit hungover lol. Basically the Soviets boycotted the games, and set up their Friendship Games. Meanwhile, at the Olympics, gymnastics was dominated by the Soviets so with no Soviets there an American woman won the all around. This was massive because she was the first American to win it, and the second American after her who won was in 2004. So when you watched that Olympics without the Soviets, it was a good standard of gymnastics and it was clear that the American was the easy winner. Then, maybe a decade ago, people started talking about the Friendship Games again and what the quality of gymnastics was like then. Someone went digging around and found the tapes of the friendship games (they're on YouTube now which is actually amazing because some of the gymnasts who competed at the Friendship Games had never seen themselves compete and now decades later they finally did) and when you compare the Soviet level of gymnastics in 76, to the American woman who won, well they were like two completely different sports. So in the gymnastics community now (or gymternet), when that American woman is referred to in regards to that gold medal, we often say she has an asterisks next to her name because she really only won after the Soviets boycotted. It used to be a kind of mean thing to say about her, but recently she has done some pretty shitty things so everyone is back on the \"Mary Lou gold medal asterisks\" train again. ",

He said that he took many supplements, which were legal, and had his blood drawn, given IVs occasionally with vitamins, etc. It honestly wouldn't be that hard to add a steroid, or other cocktail that wasn't allowed. The famed increase in strength, endurance, muscle mass, etc. could easily be dismissed as olympians during the run up to the Olympics often increase their workout schedule and get coached a lot more closely, and that is just in the USA.\n\nWhat most people don't realize is \"steroids\" actually covers a ton of drug types, not just steroids. Not knowing what exactly was given to the athletes, it could have been something that just increased blood flow or allowed for better oxygen circulation; both of which may be illegal according the IOC.

Neither nation gives a shit about hockey and the game would be dull, OHL teams would beat them. \n\nAs for the gimmick teams you can't say they weren't fun to watch especially the NA team.

The guy took up swimming eight months before the event, practiced in a lake somewhere in Equatorial Guinea, and had up until the event never seen a full-sized Olympic swimming pool before in his life.\n\nShows that it's not necessarily about winning or breaking world records. It's about participating, about doing one's best. Pretty sure that when he was completely spent with 20 meters to go, all that carried him to the finish line was the amazing crowd that cheered for him as if he was Phelps.\n\n(Honorable mention to Robel Kieros Habte, representing Ethiopia (and dadbods worldwide) that [finished a similar race](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1j7y1BDlA4) against actual people.)",

Period.\n\nYou had entire lines of All-Stars and future first-ballot HOF'ers coming over the boards at the same time.  It was full speed back and forth at all times.  Both teams spent most of the game rolling four lines that never stopped playing like a first line.\n\nThe Olympics do not condone fighting, so there was no need for the enforcers.  It was all skill, all skating, all the time.\n\nNo game will ever eclipse that one.  Ever.  It was an honor to watch it (until that turnover in the corner...).",
