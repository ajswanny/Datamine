And it was Green protesters outside and trying to get in that made all the ruckus and holding banners and making these headline worthy statements.\n\nIt does not say anywhere that anyone (trump's people or otherwise) proposed that coal or other any other fossil fuels or nuclear were a best-case solution, only that today they exist, economies HUGELY depend on them, and they cannot be quickly eliminated so people might need to consider how to handle them efficiently until that fact changes.(I personally hope it does in my lifetime).\n\nThen they go on to quote a lot of angry Green people who talk about how coal is like cancer to the climate (they are right and no one tells them they are wrong) and that we should keep coal, gas and uranium in the ground (that would surely be ideal but... what?). But no one says anything to disagree with the point of the actual talk or offers an alternative solution to the current state of global power sources.\n\nHonestly this article is the equivalent of making an angry tweet a CNN headline. Sorry to rain on the parade here, but let's read the entire story, no?",

Until storage and transportation technologies make massive breakthroughs, it's not realistic to rely on just wind/solar. Until that, it will need to be supported by always-on power generation. Germany is an interesting example, because they are currently burning *massive* amounts of coal due to their knee-jerk reactions to nuclear after Fukushima.\n\nEdit: So as a disclosure, I'm pro-nuclear (and pro-research into both fusion and renewables)",

    "body": "This is one of those things that gets repeated over and over but although true as an average, it's not true for everyone and everywhere.\n\nI am in favor of cleaner energy sources, but renewables are not as cheap as alternatives in most countries, just some.\n\nThere are I would say five factors in planning new energy sources.\n\n(1) How much is the start up cost (IE: How much will the loan amount be and how much interest will have to be paid on it over its life)\n\n(2) How much will maintenance cost.\n\n(3) How much tax revenue will be generated from power generation and supporting industries (IE: coal industry, turbine industry, solar panel industry etc.)\n\n(4) How much of potential oversupply can be sold to other states\n\n(5) How many new lines and grounding stations will have to be developed in order to link up this power source to the grid?\n\nSo I'm in Canada and it's very easy to figure out what sources cost what because our governments are required to show this (given that it is all state run).\n\nSo for example provinces that got rid of coal and replaced it with wind and nuclear were saddled with paying for the legacy costs (the loans and interest) on former coal plants.  This heightened the costs of these energy sources.  Without that legacy cost wind was the winner due to us producing our own turbines and blades and the great supply.\n\nBut because it was cheap in the past doesn't mean it'd be the same in the future.  Basically the last of our \"wind belt\" is being developed now and any new wind projects that come up will produce far less power and cost far more.  Offshore wind is not going to work because of icebergs.\n\nSolar is very expensive in Canada and very inefficient.  Most importantly we don't produce our own solar panels meaning that our economies will not benefit as heavily from such a switch.  We have long summer days but short winter days, meaning that when we use most of our power (the winter) it won't be available.  It means you will need supplementary power supplies to off set the loss in solar during peak times.  Most importantly the maintenance costs go up.  You will need to pay people to shovel off solar panels in the winter time.\n\nMost importantly most of the world's renewables are being installed in the third world right now where costs are lower and wages are lower.  You're not going to get those same bottom dollar wage prices in a first world nation.\n\nAlthough the average says solar is second most cheapest in the world right now, it's not a reality for most nations.  I believe the US has the second highest installed solar in the world.  [It seems in the United States the cheapest form of power is natural gas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost_of_electricity_by_source).\n\nOn hydro you have to build copious amounts of lines to get the power source to market which means setting a large easement area.",

Collisions with buildings, cars, and even hunting by cats kills magnitudes more. Siting and selective stopping makes it negligible. Even the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds in UK supports wind power as fossil fuels is a much larger threat and wind power reduces the use of fossil fuels. Recently here there's controversy too over a nuclear plant being approved - despite contracts offered by wind companies at about half the price.\n\nSolar radiance varies greatly by location - but in southern Europe they are already cheaper than fossil fuels and the cost is plummeting rapidly (even though common perception is lagging behind and thinking they are expensive). China and India are sure as hell not making huge solar farms because they are expensive or because of pressure from tree-hugging hippies.\n\nI don't think we can be fully fossil fuels free without nuclear, but also don't think those common criticisms are very fair either.",

This year we might actually use slightly less coal power than in 2009 which is good, but the downside is we've mostly just been reducing hard coal, not the much more polluting lignite coal. \n\n[In absolute numbers, we're still burning more lignite coal than in the 1990s for crying out loud!](http://industry.eiu.com/asset_images/772664261.GIF)\n\nCoal is alive in Germany because it still has a positive image for many Germans, particularly in NRW. Germany has been asleep at the wheel when it comes to reducing CO2 emissions. Renewable power is great and all, but what's the point if we're just replacing nuclear power plants. \n\nIt's time to shut down some of the most polluting coal power plants right now. We might have to import some power when there's neither wind nor sun, but no power plants anywhere in Europe are as horrible when it comes to CO2 emissions than German lignite coal power plants, even Polish power plants are cleaner.\n\n/rant",

Something that almost everyone in the land eats, from the bottom of the \"pack\" to the top. It's a leveller of people. Yet the media used it against him.

The market-based measure is currently set at \u00a323 a tonne of carbon until 2020 and is designed as a \u201ctop up\u201d to the European emissions trading system, which has languished at \u00a35 a tonne on the Continent over much of the year.\n\n...\n\n> \u201cBritain is reducing its carbon emissions from electricity faster than any other major country, and this has happened because the carbon price and lower gas prices have forced coal off the system \u2013 the amount of coal-fired power generation in Britain has fallen 80pc between 2012 and 2016,\u201d said Dr Iain Staffell, from Imperial College London.",

In 1861, in his first inaugural address Lincoln said \"I have no purpose, directly or indirectly, to interfere with the institution of slavery in the States where it exists. I believe I have no lawful right to do so, and I have no inclination to do so.\"\n\nIt is also correct that most (white) Americans who supported the north, did so mostly for the union, and not out of moral objection to slavery. Abolitionists where an important and vocal minority, but they were considered \"extremist\" by mainstream politics at the time, including hardcore Republicans.\n\nEmancipation came only during the war, and mostly as a military measure to hurt the confederate economy.\n\nSo, some people like to cling to these and say the war was just about the union and states' rights, but obviously the reason this argument even happened (and has been going on for decades by then) was slavery. It wasn't the final straw in a list of states' rights issues (though there were others), it was *the* issue, as is clearly evident in the justification the confederate states gave to their own secession. e.g. Mississippi states - \"Our position is thoroughly identified with the institution of slavery\" or \"There was no choice left us but submission to the mandates of abolition, or a dissolution of the Union\".

They need to be slaves forever!\u201d The south was heavily dependent on farming, and at the time ending slavery would be devastating to many communities in the south. \n\nThere absolutely were some terrible, racist slaveowners who are the absolute scum of the earth. I\u2019m going to be *very clear* here, I\u2019m not denying that slavery was wrong, nor am I saying that the decision to begin a war was justified. I\u2019m simply explaining the way some people view the civil war (you know, with objectivity). \n\nSo the south seceded from the US, but the country as a whole was dependent on the farming production in the south. This was the confederates leverage and ultimately this was the reason a civil war was started. \n\nGuys like Jefferson Davis and Robert E. Lee were *brilliant.* What many don\u2019t realize is that the confederate constitution outlined a way to phase out slavery rather than abruptly end it.  Lee *denounced* the secession as \u201cnothing but a revolution\u201d and an \u201cunconstitutional betrayal to the founding fathers.\u201d These weren\u2019t bad men, at least not all of them were bad. Certainly not Lee and Davis. \n\nThe Union army wanted Lee for a top command position, but Lee ultimately joined the confederacy due to personal honor and a duty to defend his home state of Virginia. He was a man amongst boys. \n\nThere\u2019s a lot of history in the civil war that doesn\u2019t make the history books. It\u2019s fascinating to look into, I would encourage you to do your own research, but do so objectively. If you run in thinking all of these guys were illiterate Hill-Billy\u2019s, you\u2019re going to misinterpret a lot of what you read. \n\n",

Its labor supplies the product which constitutes by far the largest and most important portions of commerce of the earth. These products are peculiar to the climate verging on the tropical regions, and by an imperious law of nature, none but the black race can bear exposure to the tropical sun. These products have become necessities of the world, and a blow at slavery is a blow at commerce and civilization. That blow has been long aimed at the institution, and was at the point of reaching its consummation. There was no choice left us but submission to the mandates of abolition, or a dissolution of the Union, whose principles had been subverted to work out our ruin. \n\nOr Vice President of the Confederate States of America Alexander H. Stephens' famous \"[Cornerstone Address](https://sourcebooks.fordham.edu/mod/1861stephens.asp)\": \n\n>Our new Government is founded upon exactly the opposite ideas; its foundations are laid, its cornerstone rests, upon the great truth that the negro is not equal to the white man; that slavery, subordination to the superior race, is his natural and moral condition. [Applause.] This, our new Government, is the first, in the history of the world, based upon this great physical, philosophical, and moral truth. This truth has been slow in the process of its development, like all other truths in the various departments of science. It is so even amongst us. Many who hear me, perhaps, can recollect well that this truth was not generally admitted, even within their day. The errors of the past generation still clung to many as late as twenty years ago. Those at the North who still cling to these errors with a zeal above knowledge, we justly denominate fanatics. All fanaticism springs from an aberration of the mind; from a defect in reasoning. It is a species of insanity. One of the most striking characteristics of insanity, in many instances, is, forming correct conclusions from fancied or erroneous premises; so with the anti-slavery fanatics: their conclusions are right if their premises are. They assume that the negro is equal, and hence conclude that he is entitled to equal privileges and rights, with the white man.... I recollect once of having heard a gentleman from one of the Northern States, of great power and ability, announce in the House of Representatives, with imposing effect, that we of the South would be compelled, ultimately, to yield upon this subject of slavery; that it was as impossible to war successfully against a principle in politics, as it was in physics or mechanics. That the principle would ultimately prevail. That we, in maintaining slavery as it exists with us, were warring against a principle-a principle founded in nature, the principle of the equality of man. The reply I made to him was, that upon his own grounds we should succeed, and that he and his associates in their crusade against our institutions would ultimately fail. The truth announced, that it was as impossible to war successfully against a principle in politics as well as in physics and mechanics, I admitted, but told him it was he and those acting with him who were warring against a principle. They were attempting to make things equal which the Creator had made unequal.\n\nSo there you have it, it was about their right to own slaves and that right was a God given right and the most important part of their financial survival.",

    "body": "People don't go looking for irrefutable evidence to the contrary, they look for things that support their existing worldview.\n\nI don't say this only happens to climate change deniers. EVERYONE does this. Let's take a silly example: How often do you go and look up videos and papers about flat earth theories? If you do (and that's a big if), do you read them carefully so as to carefully weigh their points, or do you just skim along and laugh at how stupid someone would have to be to believe in a flat earth theory?\n\nMost people don't go looking up flat earth theories, and those that do don't go in with the intent to try to carefully understand them, they just go in for a laugh. That's because flat earth theories are stupid. BUT... for climate change deniers, the same could be said about the liberal climate change sheep, and visa versa.\n\nPeople (and I mean 99.9% of people) prefer to insulate themselves with ideas that don't destabilize their existing world view. That's why the growth of the internet has lead to more polarization. It's very easy to become very well-read and educated from a hundred different sources without ever once coming across anything that challenges your world view.",
