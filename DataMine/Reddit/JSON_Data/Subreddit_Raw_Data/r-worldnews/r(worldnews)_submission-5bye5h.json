    "body": "Hijacking a top comment. I posted this elsewhere but might as well post it here:\n\nwww.cic.gc.ca is our government immigration website. But yup, wow it's down.\n\nSome immigration information for those who are actually serious and not just lashing out: It's difficult to immigrate to Canada. If you just want to work here, you have to find an employer who is willing to go through the LMIA process, which costs them money, and they have to prove they could not hire a Canadian for the position.\n\nThe easiest way if you were a student (or could be) within the last 12 months and under 30 is to go into a SWAP programme, (aka working holiday visa). Click one of these sites: \n\nhttp://www.swap.ca/in_eng/partners.aspx#USA to see more\n (Edit: This is not for immigration, but for working. However, it can possibly give you the 1 year Canadian work experience towards Express Entry. Or just a holiday).\n\nIf you fall into the NAFTA categories, which Trump wants to eliminate: http://www.canadavisa.com/nafta-work-permits.html (easy work permit).\n\nIf you are highly skilled, you can enter through various skilled worker programmes, by applying through Express Entry. A good source of info is these forums: http://www.canadavisa.com/canada-immigration-discussion-board/index.php\n\nEE FAQ: http://www.canadavisa.com/express-entry-faq-candidates.html\n\nThere's also the Provincial nominee programmes. FAQ: http://www.canadavisa.com/provincial-nomination-program.html\n(FTR I am not a canadavisa.com shill. They just have the best info and forums out there for this stuff)\n\nYour last(and best) hope is to fall in love with a handsome or beautiful Canadian, and apply for spousal or common-law sponsorship. This is really the easiest route, but it involves having a genuine relationship with one of us Northern God/Goddesses.\n\nFor visitors: You can visit for 6 months without needing a visa. It's referred to as \"status\" for non-visa requiring countries such as America. After the 6 months, you need to renew it. This is usually done at the 5-month mark and can be done online. Restrictions for visitors are very clear: You cannot work, or go to school for more than a 6-month course. \n\nIf the course is something ongoing (like a degree programme) that falls into the no-no category. Something like a 2-month pottery course at a college is ok, however.\n\nGood luck, Yanks!\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/LKpX8Rh.jpg\n",

A destabilized U.S. is the most dangerous thing that can happen in the international system. What happens when Russia invades a Nato country?

What happens when China takes the islands in the South China Sea and Japan and China are at each other's throats?\n\n\nIf you think that you can get out, move to Norway and shut the door behind you and let the rest of the country burn, everyone else be damned, then you are as short-sighted and selfish as the people you are demonizing for voting Trump. \n",

Hopefully any of the huge donors and oligarchs that were riding on Hillary bail out for good. This is another method to get money out of politics, at least out of the DNC. We proved that donors don't equate to votes. We proved that they still have to give us a candidate we can digest, and they can't pick and choose for us.\n\nJust imagine how much Hillary was probably running around and promising, all the donors giving her back scratches waiting for their turn, all the connections she made that were riding on her victory. She failed. Her promises aren't going to mean shit anymore. She's done.\n\nIt might not be the result we wanted, but these people only care about winning and we wanted the guy who could've done that, and what WE want is what matters in the end. Her failure and the DNCs failure is a big win in other ways. It proves to them that they can't pull this shit without consequences.\n\nMaybe I'm optimistic, but I think the best thing that came out of this is that people are rightfully pointing fingers at the DNC. You want Hillary to win the primaries? You got it. You want Trump as your \"pied piper\" republican candidate? You sure as fuck got that! You want to win?
