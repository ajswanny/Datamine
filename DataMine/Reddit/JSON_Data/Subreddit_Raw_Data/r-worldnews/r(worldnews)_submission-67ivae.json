I see the State Oceans and International Environmental and Scientific Affairs Economic Support fund is going from 1,000,000 to 31,400, a significant drop. The USAID Bureau for Food Security is going from 0 to 100,000, probably part of the push to fold the state dept into USAID \n\nEdit - removed the $ signs since the the chart numbers are in thousands",

He hated the CIA, a few other government agencies and various politicians, and they hated him too. I would have liked to see him finish his term and not get his brains blown out, as he most likely would have gotten reelected because the people at the time loved him. He was calm, smart, and I believe his policies could have really changed the course of our country for the better.",

    "body": "> Carter treated the American people as adults and told them the truth\n\n\\#1 rule of staying elected: Tell the idiot fucking masses what they want to hear, not what they need to hear.\n\nIf you've ever wondered why American politics is so dysfunctional, don't blame the media, politicians, lobbyists, corporations. Blame yourselves, the voters. \n\nWe are a stupid people. And in a democracy we get the government we deserve. This is what we deserve. Until people get pissed off and start blaming **the right people**, we're never going to get anywhere. In any sane country, Trump doesn't even make it out of the primaries. There were plenty of perfectly acceptable, \"reasonable\" Republican candidates to choose from. Americans instead decided to throw a fucking temper tantrum about the shitty mess they had created for themselves and nominate a wholly unqualified, inexperienced, temperamentally unfit, misogynist, racist, dumb fucking child to the most powerful office in the world. Then 45% of the American people decided to vote him into that office for real. \n\nAnd don't hide behind this stupid fucking \"only 55% of people voted!\" That 45% isn't all Hillary voters. About half of them are Trump voters too. And if they were dumb enough to stay home when they knew Trump being elected was a possibility, then they're just as dumb as a Trump voter. \n\nHasn't the Trump election taught us something? Hasn't it taught us that voters > lobbyists/money/media? Is anyone going to claim the media was kind to Trump? They blasted him at every turn. The establishment of both parties didn't like Trump. The GOP only came around when he won the nomination and even then it was the most tepid endorsement I've ever seen. Trump got outspent in the primaries and the general election and he still won. Yes, your vote is fucking counted and it fucking matters. It matters more than all the fucking money on the planet. So stop bitching about lobbyists and corporations and the media and go the fuck out there and vote. \n\nAnd do you think politicians don't know that votes > money? Reddit has this fucking retarded hardon for \"oh we live in an oligarchy and our votes don't matter. Politicians are bought by corporations.\" Fucking no. You really think your vote isn't counted? You actually think a politician is going to do anything he thinks will piss off his constituents and get him unelected for $10,000? I fucking doubt it. Above all, politicians want to stay in office. They know that means pandering to their stupid fucking American constituents. Hooray for Americans and democracy. We're #1. \n\nHahaha just kidding let's keep blaming politicians. That's really worked over the past 30 years. Hahaha.",

Even if the current republican govt passed an upgraded ACA (with all the things they prevented from passing) people would still assume it was Obama's.\n* Trump's administration needs to get their shit together. They lack the ability to keep power. Meanwhile their opposition has become united in a way that hasn't happened since LBJ. Reagan was a very good politician and a sly one at that, his taking credit for the Iran Hostage crisis and the whole Iran-Contra affair shows it.\n* Trump's administration seeks to cut the same way that Reagan did. Reagan's cutting of programs was ruthless and helped increase the difference in financial situation, leading to the huge amount of crime in the 80s and early 90s. This was to create tax cuts, which even then were not sustainable (but held for long enough for it to be someone else's problem). Trump's administration seems to be going a bit too fast, and might end up falling on itself when still in term.\n* The fact that the US has chosen to not go into the TPP, but Mexico will means that Mexico will be the best path to the Asian market. This will make renegotiating NAFTA a pain. Pulling out is a suicide scenario for all three countries involved, Mexico is only hedging its bets on the US burning faster. This will not be pretty as prices for a lot of things increase, and jobs start disappearing and paying less.\n* Trump is a reaction pulling back towards right very aggressively, but the first 100 days have shown that there has been a shift and its not changing. If anything I think that Obama will be seen as the \"left Reagan\" remembered far more fondly and less controversially after a few years.",

    "body": "Lots of people don't vote but its not because they are stupid or lazy or uncommitted. It's because politicians in a particular party do literally everything they can think to prevent as many people from voting as possible. Between gerrymandering, voter ID laws, and voter suppression tactics, the Republicans have done an amazing job making voting feel completely and utterly hopeless. Not to mention it's been blatantly obvious for years that the electoral college is outdated and anti-democratic and disincentivizes voting in any place that isn't a swing state.",

A media company that doesn't pander to the dumb fucking American base is as dead in the water as a politician who doesn't pander to the dumb fucking American base.\n\nMoreover, how does an education system teach the morons who refuse to be taught? Half the country is creationist. They demand that creationism be given equal time in science classrooms. They demand that teachers not teach \"liberal\" global warming science. \n\nThe problem, at its core, is the stupidity of the people. And since we steadfastly refuse to take responsibility for that, just as you're attempting to do now, we will never ever improve.",
