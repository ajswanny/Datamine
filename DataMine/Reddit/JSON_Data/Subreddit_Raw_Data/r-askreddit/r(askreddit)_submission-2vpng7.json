Code name \"Ol Faithful\" continues to sneeze at regular intervals of about 6 minutes. I'm pretty sure she was sneezing between the first two updates too it's just I was watching Captain America: The Winter Soldier and it's a pretty dope movie \n\nEdit 10:46 \n \nShe sneezed again and coughed right after. I asked her how she felt and she didn't answer so I was like if you're awake don't say anything so I'm pretty sure she's just mad at me. Or sleeping. I do have Captain America on pretty loud. And I've totally been staring at Scarjo's ass the whole time. But it's about more than that I think- she's ready for serious commitment that I'm just not sure I can handle right now (10:50 another sneeze/cough) I don't know I guess it feels like we're both going the same path in life and we have similar views and opinions and senses of humor and everything and we match each other perfectly but I'm just not sure. I don't know. I'm scared to be that open with someone. You let someone into your head and they judge you they can leave you and break you and it hurts man. It hurts. People are animals but maybe she's not. No she's definitely sleeping now.\n\nEdit 11:03 2/12/15\n\nShe's throwing up in the bathroom now, girlfriend has the flu. Shit is grossssss. For some reason I haven't gotten sick at all though even though I've been with her a lot, my mom thinks it morning sickness but also that's just my mom (I hope) Captain America still going strong. How can someone be happy if their two biggest fears are commitment and dying alone? I don't know what I'm doing with my life\n\nFuck\n\nEdit 11:18 2/12/15 \n\nShe just sneezed again. I'm signing off. This has been too self reflective for my taste and I try go long periods without acknowledging my problems directly. Thanks guys.",

    "body": "I think it would go like this. A bunch of allergy sufferers would realize they all have suddenly stopped sneezing, perhaps through an online message board for people with bad allergies. It'd start spreading around online, not quite \"viral\" because no one would give a shit at first, but it'd get mentioned on big internet hubs like reddit or 4chan.\n\nWhile this is going on, individual hospitals/medical centers/doctor's offices would start to notice that no sick people sneeze anymore. Eventually someone in one of those offices would come across the online rumors and start connecting the dots. My best guess for the flashpoint here would be when an employee of the CDC hears the rumors. \n\nOnce the CDC finds out, it would be days before everyone knew. But I have no idea how long it would take to get to the CDC. It we think in \"orders of magnitude\" like days/weeks/months/years, my best guess is many weeks or a couple of months (perhaps depending on how close to peak allergy season in the US or Western Europe the cessation occurs). \n\nAmazing question btw. A followup that I just thought of might be this: what is the most recent date at which you can be reasonably confident that humanity would *never* find out? I guess you'd have to go back to the first widespread record of sneezing, because if it sticks around in legit medical textbooks, then eventually (even if it's 100 years later) people are going to read those books and say \"wtf is a sneeze, I have literally never seen anyone do that.\" ",

Individuals would surely notice, but chalk it up to something else at first. They surely wouldn't think \"no one can sneeze now!\"\n\nEven people doing research and stuff might be troubled or confused by it, but I doubt they would suddenly think that everyone has lost the ability to sneeze because it would be such an absurd idea. Depending on how deep into the research they are, they might even consider it something like bad luck or start looking into factors that might be affecting their results.\n\nDoctors and school teachers would see similar things. They might notice a trend, but unless they're communicating with people in many areas of the world about a change in sneezing patterns, it's still likely to go unnoticed as a global occurrence.\n\nSince you said \"collectively\" realize, I think it would take longer than many people here are saying. Sure, people would start to notice the pattern somewhat quickly, but I think it would take some time for it to be information shared between various locations in the world and for researchers to at least confirm the possibility of it and dismiss the general absurdity of it.\n\nOne thing that might affect it is if people still felt the urge to sneeze... I feel like enough people having that feeling frequently and being unable to sneeze might start reporting it earlier. It's such an annoying feeling and many people might consult doctors to see if they can do something about it.",

    "body": "My freshman year of high school. Taking a test in my american studies class and I have this annoying little sniffle. We've all had it, like there's little annoying drip of snot in your nose that either needs to be blown out or repeatedly sniffed back in. Its completely silent in class except for me and I can't handle it anymore. I get up and to the relief of everyone sitting around me I stride purposefully toward the box of Kleenex at the front of the classroom, quickly grab one and in one move begin to stride back to my seat while bringing the Kleenex up to my nose for a quick blow to get this little guy of of there. I blow and instead of an expected little drip the flood gates of my nose let loose with a horrendous honk and the biggest ball of snot I have ever felt in my life fills the 1 measly tissue I had grabbed as well as my entire hand.  I freeze mid stride, halfway to my seat, hands covering my face and just barely containing a handful of snot. I scan the classroom with my eyes to see who noticed. Everyone is looking at me from their seats, waiting for my next move. I moonwalk back to the Kleenex container and with my free hand blindly grab a handful while never taking my eyes off the class, quickly transfer the snot baseball to the the Kleenex reinforcements and wipe my nose in the process. A girl in the front row utters \"gross\". I throw the Kleenex away and return to my seat to finish test. I got a B+.",

They would dive into researching this phenomenon and set about writing papers to prove it before they came forward with their definitive evidence.\n\nMeanwhile people are noticing a little at a time. People with allergies and such, but they think it's just something weird happening to them. Their doctors can't explain it, and they might have noticed a trend, but they don't freak out or hit the panic button. \"I'm sorry, Mrs. Williams. You're just gonna have to blow your nose a lot more. Here's some sinus medication that might help as well. Guy came in last week complaining about the same, it's the damndest thing. Well, hopefully you clear up soon.\"\n\nThe ones who are bothered by it most learn to stop talking about it because they sound crazy. It's just a weird thing happening to them that they have to deal with. Maybe they tell some close friends that they believe no one is sneezing anymore and those friends give them a look of mock-sympathetic belief and say they can't think of the last time they had, but the friends don't really believe it. That's crazy.\n\nPeople talk in whispered tones, conspiracy theories abound on the crazier places on the internet. Extremist religious sects like the scientologists adapt it into their propaganda. Big Pharma and the medicine culture has stripped us of our ability to sneeze! It's the beginning of the end!\n\nWhen it becomes too big to deny, the government finally addresses it. They've spent the last few months seeking out all those scientists that figured it out first and snatching up any research they might have. They don't have any real answers, but they've got Top Men on it, they assure the public. It's not enough. People start to panic. The crazies were right. The religious extremists were right! What else have they been right about?! Is the end nigh?!\n\nMass hysteria begins to spread, and it is at this precise time that the aliens choose to attack.",

Contrary to popular belief, tortoises are in fact turtles rather than part of a separate group. Like most turtles, tortoises are shielded from predators by a shell. The top part of the shell is the carapace, the underside is the plastron, and the two are connected by the bridge. The carapace is fused to both the vertebrae and ribcage, and turtles are unique among vertebrates in that the pectoral and pelvic girdles are inside, rather than outside, the ribcage. Tortoises can vary in size from a few centimeters to two meters. They are usually diurnal animals with tendencies to be crepuscular depending on the ambient temperatures. They are generally reclusive animals. \n\nSource: I'm Wikipedia ",

Also kind of like the fictitious numbers we use to indicate something that's really really large, but an unspecified amount, like \"a zillion\" or \"a bajillion\".\n\n\"And then Jesus walked into the desert for like, a million days.\"\n\n\"Moses and the Israelites wandered in the desert for a bajillion years.\" \n\nSo \"40 days and 40 nights\" is really just \"a lot of days and a lot of nights\", and \"Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves\" is closer in meaning to \"Ali Baba and the Fuckton of Thieves.\"",

Because I sneeze when i go outside, much less even look at the sun. You wear tinted helmet visors, and your body/ brain is MUCH more focused on other things while you're flying formation than to think about sneezing. Like not twiching and hitting your friend who is literally flying at 400mph 3' off your wing, pulling 3G's. But that IS fun.. \nlong story short... Go for it. I was a long shot to begin with, but somehow managed to accomplish all that I have, and get to where I am. And I still sneeze looking at the sun.",
