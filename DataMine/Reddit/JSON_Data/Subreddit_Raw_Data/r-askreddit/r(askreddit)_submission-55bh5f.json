But expressing genuine interest in your counterpart is the best way to foster reciprocal interest. \n\n2. Break the touch barrier. At some point, before you kiss her (or him), you'll need to break the touch barrier. Hand on the thigh, small of the back, over the shoulder, etc. Physical contact... Not incidental - intentional. Start small.... Hand firmly on the small of her (his) back. Not aggressive, but clearly intentional. This is a huge moment because you watch the reaction. If they pull back, remove your hand, or react negatively in any fashion that's a clear signal. Anything else, indifferent or positive, is a sign of comfort, and ultimately a good thing. \n\nWorth noting, it's all about gradually expressing your interest in small increments, then judging the reaction. Talking... They seem interested? Good. Break touch barrier. They're not put off by you touching them? Good. Etc. \n\nAnd finally.... if you're having good conversation and have broken the touch barrier, the last step is the hardest and simplest. Fucking do it. Move close, make eye contact, whatever seems natural and appropriate. Again... Express your intentions with body language and judge the reaction. If you're holding eye contact and relatively close, look at their lips. In fact... Look at their lips. Once you've sensed there is mutual desire, close the gap and alternate between eye contact and looking at their lips. This lets them know what you're thinking. \n\nAnd then.... The hard part.... Just fucking do it. If you've made it this far and they have shown the signs and hesitate when you try... At that point... It's not even your fault. But if you've made it this far and they're still showing interest, based on my experience, they won't hesitate. They're waiting for you to step up and go. So fucking step up and go already. ",

    "body": "The most important thing you can do in your life right now is learn to recognize the \"kiss me\" look, also known as the \"yes please\" look or the \"take me\" look. \n\nWhen a girl (I'm assuming) is down you can see it in her eyes. People can fake a lot of things but the eyes usually give it away. \n\nSo the best move isn't what you do to them, it's paying attention to them so you're in touch with what she's thinking. If you learn to do that you'll gain a ton of confidence encause you just know and that's sexy. \n\nStep two is making sure the other person is comfortable with whatever you're about to do. Many people advocate for getting consent even for kissing because it establishes trust and comfort and it's rude to assume. If you lose those trust and comfort you'll turn someone off like a light switch. Game over. I say a dorky \"can I kiss you\" and her thinking you're a dork is better than just planting one on someone and her thinking you're a rapist in training. \n\nFor moving in for the kiss you can just ask, can I kiss you? If you're set on just going for it then you lean in slowly and PAY ATTENTION TO HER REACTION. If she leans in then keep going. If she turns aside, leans away, looks surprised or uncomfortable ABORT. Better to dorkily abort than plant one on someone who doesn't want it. \n\nIf you get this far start slowly and with a small mouth opening and work your way up to tongue. Pay attention to how she's kissing you and use that as a way to judge how to escalate. This takes practice, you'll fuck it up, that's okay. If things get weird and you feel like you're out of sync with her in any way you can back away, smile at her and start again if she looks like she's enjoying herself. There's. nothing wrong with fumbling around a bit the first time you make out with someone until you both figure out how to get it in gear. \n\nIf she likes you and is generally down the most important thing is that she feels safe and comfortable. If she feels that way with you then you're going to go far. If she doesn't then she's not going to open up to you. \n\nYou want to know about the neck and the ears. The neck and ears are the secrets to my success. Best to start lightly and judge her reaction than go in heavy with teeth. Play around with her neck and ear lobes and judge her reaction. Some people like it harder and with more teeth than others and finding the right amount of pressure is a skill. Some people like more than just the ear lobes, try it all out. Ear wax is about the grossest thing you can taste but it's worth the risk to find the spots she likes. Some people don't like any teeth at all. It's also important to develop an idea for her tolerance for marks and respect those. As you develop your skills think about how to get the most with the least marks... ...unless she's into marks, then by all means go for it. \n\nEvery person is different, never assume what works on one will for another. Learning what works with someone new is half the fun! This goes for more than just kissing. \n\nOne last point: just because someone is going along with something doesn't mean it's what they want to do. They may feel uncomfortable or are afraid to say no and stop something. That's why it's good to ask. You do not want her telling everyone how horrible you are, and she will, because you were all over her when she didn't really want to. You can say it's her responsibility to say no but it doesn't change how it makes her feel nor what everyone else will hear when she talks to them. \n\nAlso: Benny and June. I have literally never seen the last half hour of that movie. ",

    "body": "I had a hard time breaking the ice as a teenager. I finally discovered the truth behind almost every situation. She's already hanging out with you, she could literally be anywhere else, but she's not. That means she at least likes you. But does she want to kiss? Start by putting your arm around her, don't make a big deal of it, just do it. If you're nervous about doing that, wait until she gets up and comes back to sit down to just put your arm on her chair before she sits. If she sits in your arm, good sign. If she avoids your arm, bad sign, end the encounter as soon as possible as you're wasting everyone's time and it's uncomfortable for everyone. Or you can just get up and go to the bathroom, when you get back put your arm around her when you sit down.\n\nOnce there, you can place your hand on her shoulder, if she doesn't flinch or anything weird like that, play with her hair or the back of her neck. If she doesn't react negatively, you're way in the clear. Now, the kiss. It's as straight forward as the arm around her that we just went over. I personally like just looking at her for an instant a few times, don't stare that's creepy (but also might not be creepy... see the last two paragraphs for an explanation). She can see you out of her peripheral vision, she knows you're thinking about her. Then when you're ready just look at her and say quietly, \"Hey...\" She'll look at your eyes. Then just lean in and kiss her. Bam. It's that easy. Not only did you just kiss her, but you did it on your own accord, when you wanted to, like a man. Good job buddy, you should be proud of yourself. You'll feel 10x better because you kissed, and 100x better because the stress is off of your shoulders.\n\nNow you're most likely thinking, \"But what if this!? and what if that!? What if she pulls away!?\" Listen, here's the deal about women that you will eventually learn. Creepy guys can say creepy things to girls, but if the girl happens to think Mr Creep is hot, she literally doesn't register anything he does as creepy. All those creepy things are hot or \"naughty\". At the EXACT same time, a good guy saying honest nice things to a girl with the best intentions can be psychologically registered as the biggest, rapiest, creep on the planet. She literally doesn't register anything as nice if she isn't attracted to you.\n\nGo on, go prove this to yourself. Once you know a girl really likes you, say some weird shit to her, she'll laugh and slap you on the shoulder or something. Then go say \"Hi, I think your hair looks nice today.\" to a stuck up idiot that thinks she's a 9.5 when she's a 5.5. She will be disgusted, honestly insulted, and genuinely creeped out. So what can we learn from this revelation of female psychology? You need to learn that it damn near literally doesn't matter what you say. If she likes you, you can and will fuck up and she'll still like you. If she doesn't like you, believe me you'll know.\n\nCheers,",

I have to stop. I have to go\" I barely thought as we made out, his breath hot in my mouth as I held his face to mine, guiding and leading him, pushing him back a bit and exploring his mouth with my tongue quickly and with vigor as he follows suit. \"This is insane. Why am I in charge?\" I think, pressing my chest against his one last time before leaning back. I make an excuse and scurry out of the truck, bewildered as to what happened to me. \n     If mom noticed my lips were hella red, or my cheeks burning, she didn't say so. I'm normally hella quiet and deferential, so this was the craziest, best, most exciting thing I'd ever done. The four year anniversary of our kiss and us dating is later this month :) Hope that helped somebody.\n\n\n\nTl;dr get possessed by crazy kiss instincts and lead the action, get the guy.",

People have been listing their favourite make-out **movies** to which OP has been replying \"Not movies\". Some users, particularly /u/GhostalMedia have been replying with \"I assure you, that's a movie\". Hilarity inevitably ensued and a brief and tiny meme was born.\n\nIf you liked this thread, you'll love [Reddit, what movie helped you through a rough time?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/33z828/reddit_what_movie_helped_you_through_a_rough_time/) in which everyone responded \"Paul Blart Mall Cop ~~2~~\" in various and increasingly convoluted ways, so as to initially disguise the eventual answer. \n\nThank you, and please enjoy the thread!",

    "body": "One time a girl changed a date to \"can I come over and drink at 1130pm.  So it was obviously a booty call, right?  So we watch a particularly long movie and the whole time I'm trying to put the *movies* on her but she doesn't bite.  I'm not one to just throw myself on a girl, she's welcome to change her mind and her and I had never done anything up to that point.\n\nAnyhow the movie ends, credits are rolling, we are both pretty drunk at this point.  I'm throughly confused because her body language is not giving anything off.  So I look at her,  She looks at me smiles awkwardly and then looks away.  So I just say what's on my drunk mind, \"so, did you want to make out or something?\"  \n\nShe looks at me with a big beaming smile like she just saw the sun for the first time in 3 months an says \"sure.\"   Throughly confused but excited to test her lips I go in.  She slides down and I'm ontop of her.  We make out for a few, and she starts inching off her top.  Of course I help her take it the rest of the way off. We smooch some more and I explore the newly exposed skin.  She reaches back to fumble with her bra clasp and being the gentlemen I am, I reach back to give her assistance because I am much quicker at unhooking a bra then most women are (eagerness or the fact they have to contort their arm I'm not sure but I'm always happy to help a sister out).   \n\nSo completely topless I dive back onto her; makeout intensifies.  She reaches for her pant button at which point I lean back \"so, I have 5 roommates, the are probably not going to get up but do you want to move this to the bedroom?\"\n\nLong story short I ask and she says (two separate times) that she wants to bang. 3 inches from penetration, literally I was on my entrance thrust and she says \"I should warn you, I'm a virgin.\" \n\nReally awkward night all around but it made her earlier behavior a little more understandable, eager but scared.   Weird fucking night.  ",

That's creepy. She will know what you're doing right away. If she pulls back, let her. If not, she'll feel your erection. If she does like it, be chill and don't dry hump her or some shit like that. Don't be stupid. She's shown you that she's ok with knowing you're hard and that she's now ok with feeling you. It's \"safe\" because you both still have your clothes on, sexual intentions are definitely ramped up *without getting all hands grabby*, and it's easy for her to back away if she wants to.\n\nThe small of the back is key. It's not as overt as grabbing her ass and moving her closer. The small of the back is still \"within boundaries\" and allows you to show her that you're really into her without dry humping her or some stupid shit like that. Save the ass grab for when you're rolling around. Believe me, if she feels that you're hard and doesn't pull away, a rolling around, ass grabbing session probably isn't too far away. \n\nTL;DR: If a girl is into you, she won't shy away from your inevitable erection, but NO DRY HUMPING.",

Since you've probably never heard the term \"Make out moves\" (neither have I because it's not used colloquially) it simply jumped to the only previously known term that you're familiar with. \n\nIn some ways we humans see what we expect to see all the time. When you're looking at the world, you're seeing yourself more than the world, in most cases. We only see the things that interest us or confirm our beliefs, everything else is filtered out unless we make a conscious effort. That's why there's so much conflict between people, very rarely do any of us experience things as they really happened. ",
