In my experience, no one really talks about Germany as a place to visit - it\u2019s often overshadowed by France, Spain, Italy... but during my 6 months in Europe, I fell in love with Germany out of any of the countries I saw. The culture is great, the people were some of the most welcoming and generous I met, the food exceeded my expectations, and I loved the area and the sights. I spent most of my time in very southern Germany (Konstanz/Constance), but saw Munich, Berlin, Freiburg, Stra\u00dfbourg, and Salzburg (which is technically Austria, but is very very north so shares a lot with Germany). \n\nGermany was beautiful, cheap, accepting, kind, and overall my favorite place in Europe, closely followed by Bellagio, a tiny town in Northern Italy on Lake Como, and Alicante, a city in southeastern Spain. I largely found that my favorite spots were the smaller cities and towns rather than the sprawling metropolises - Paris and Rome were very underwhelming, but Germany exceeded my wildest expectations.

I've seen the others wonders and there are better ones than in Iceland (if you want to see glaciers and waterfalls go to Argentina, if you like beer, greengrass and castles go to Ireland, mountains? go to switzerland, etc), but in the only place I could see auroras was there and it was breathtaking.\nSo if you want to see as much as you can, go to Iceland, within a week and not much kilometres you will feel like that you have been in 3 different countries.\n\nSo far, my favorite country.\n\nPD: I went in October, the weather was fine and there weren't as many tourists as it could be in June.",

Aoraki/Mount Cook National Park was absolutely one of the best places I've been to - I've never seen mountains so *powerful*. \n\nQueenstown was typical tourist place, but pretty cool in of itself. I made the hike up to Milford Sound, which was pretty great. Almost like taking a scene out of Jurassic Park.\n\nGotta say, New Zealand (at least the South Island, didn't travel to the North Island) lived up to its hype.\n\nEdit: The town(s) that were close to Lake Pukaki were Twizel and Tekapo. Also made a stop at Lake Tekapo!\n\nEdit2: I rented a car for about 7-8 days to cross-country drive from Christchurch down to Queenstown.",

Some tips:\n\n-If you're using public traffic like trains and your ticket per day is above a certain amount: get a 'GA' for the day, it is often cheaper and you'll have access to ALL public transport (even ferries).\n\n-Avoid Lucerne if you don't like touristey and expensive places.\n\n-Go hiking in the mountains - you'll get the views and if you don't use cablecars its basically free.\n\n-Look for couchsurfing possibilities to save some money, the community is decently active, especially in cities.\n\nPM if you want more tips :)",

We fell in love with Abtenau. From there we went to a Gasthof just south of Trieben for a few days. I have my private pilot's license and arranged for us to go for a flight from the Trieben airport. We spent an hour in the air flying around the mountains and enjoying the stunning scenery. After that we spent a day in Leoben. I got a haircut in Leoben and from there we took an overnight train to Italy.\n\nI'd love to go back and see Vienna and more of Austria. Initially we had planned to spend more time in Germany, and hadn't planned on really visiting Austria. My wife's ancestry is Italian but she had never been there, so Italy was the big thing on her bucket list. We knew we had to get from Germany to Italy and decided to travel through Austria to get there (since all we heard about Switzerland was how expensive it is). After looking at Austria it ended up becoming more and more interesting and looked like such a nice place, so we started carving days out of other parts of the trip to be able to spend more time in Austria, and I'm glad we did. You have a beautiful country.\n\n* edit: accidentally typed Sweden when I meant to type Switzerland",

We arrived at the address, it didn't look right but the front door was open. I walked up the stairs and a man was just sitting on his couch watching TV. I asked if it was the hostel, he laughed and said 'about five year ago it was, where are you from?' I told him I was an Australian and my friend was from Switzerland.

    "body": "I had 7 days planned in Prague, 3, then to Amsterdam for 3, then back to Prague for 4 before going on to Moscow and then back to South Korea where I was living.\n\nI had just spent something like 7-10 days in Spain where I rented a car and literally drove all over the place. Was a lot of fun but exhausting. Wake up each morning and do a little exploring, jump in the car for a few hours of exploring, get to a new city around dinner, rinse and repeat. \n\nWe had no plans in Spain, or reservations, so we arrived in Prague in a similar position and found a big board in the airport advertising apartments to rent. One was right downtown (two or three blocks from the big cuckoo clock) and was only like 150euro a night, but had a laundry room, etc. We called the guy up, and he happened to be on his way to the airport to pick someone else up and told us the place was ours. He also agreed we could reserve it after we got back from Amsterdam and that since we were staying so many nights he'd knock the price down and taxi us back and forth from the airport. Cool.\n\nWe get in and there is a little restaurant on the ground floor a few doors down. Prague is literally like a fairytale just walking down the street, but we started going to this place once a day, and they served one of the best steaks I'd ever eaten. So for three days we just hung out and on the third day we became friendly with one of the waiters who invited us out with his friends. We went to this underground bar (not under the ground, but low key invite only not exactly legal) where they had guys serving drinks who were performing by throwing bottles up in the air, live music, etc.\n\nWe were pretty blown away by how surreal it was. Every day having no agenda, just wandering the city and eating, shopping, wandering in and out of old buildings. The people were so much more accepting than they were in Spain. We felt welcomed and had hung out at this waiters house earlier in the day when he gave me a bag of weed for free. \n\nRight on the spot I decided we weren't going to Amsterdam. We had non-refundable tickets but no hotel reservations, and I told the waiter who got really excited and asked if I was serious. I took a shot and then loudly said, \"FUCK AMSTERDAM! I'M STAYING IN PRAGUE!'\n\nThat went over pretty well. Didn't pay for another drink the entire night. Everyone cheered. Later we went back to the restaurant (which was closed) to drink at the bar after hours. We were standing on the street smoking a joint and I saw some cops walking towards us on the opposite side. I got paranoid and started trying to conceal what we were doing and get the group of locals back into the bar. The waiter saw I was anxious and asked why, to which I stated the obvious, that we were smoking weed in public, which was illegal, and that cops were walking towards us. \n\nHe put his middle finger up in the air and said, \"FUCK THE POLICE!\" I seriously almost shit myself but later he told me something like, \"Look, we lived under Soviet oppression for decades, we don't take shit from the cops like you do in America. They weren't going to fuck with us.\"\n\nTrying to make a long story short we ended up renting a car and driving to the waiter's home town. His mom cooked stroganoff from scratch for us, we went skiing at this backwoods podunk place and got hammered with his childhood friends who then took us bowling at this completely strange 1980s discotheque which looked like even when it was built that it was horribly out of fashion. We drove into Germany to have lunch one day and then went back to Prague where we continued to simply walk around and eat and actually relax during a vacation.\n\nThe most favorite city I have ever been to.  \n",

Pub transportation was inviting and simple. The canals were romantic and fascinating. And I made some of the best of friends I could ever imagine. The city and it's way of life is ideal for someone like me and I couldn't help but feel like I had been pleasantly trapped inside a Disney movie. \n\nI definitely over-romanticize the place but goddamn, what a happy time it was. \n\nWhat is your take on the city and the country?

The shops will be so small and specific that you wonder how they make it. (the rent is low and they might have second jobs). You will see a Dollar store, two thrift stores, 2 shitty gas stations and a good gas station, 2 liquor stores, a private grocery store that doesn't have much and closes at 8. There will also be a hardware store and at least one bar. \n\nWal-Mart is like the god damn town center. When you go there you see your neighbors, Tim and Erica who you see at church every once in a while and no less than two people you went to school with. They have pretty much everything you need including groceries that are cheaper and better than the private grocers, hardware cheaper than the hardware store and everything else you would imagine to find at a walmart. The store is clean and usually people are happy and friendly and nobody is really in a rush. This is much unlike a metro Wal-Mart where people are unruly, nobody cares about how the store looks, workers are angry at their life choices. etc etc. ",

In central Indiana there's Turkey Run, of course, and downtown Indy/near 465 has a bunch of cool areas like Holliday park and Eagle Creek. In Southern Indiana, there are a treasure trove of smaller but beautiful parks in Monroe and Brown county. Hoosier National Forest and Brown County State Park are both phenomenal. Lake Monroe is the largest and (imo) most beautiful lake in the state, in BCSP. Patoka Lake is also gorgeous (and quite large) in the HNF.\n\nWithout knowing what's closer to you, I think that's the best list I can give. Really if you just Google search for parks nearby, they mostly should have decent pictures and can give you an idea of what's worth visiting.",

It's famous for the deer park, there is a big part of the town where there are literally deer wandering around, they are pretty docile and you can buy special biscuits to feed them, also if you bow to them they will bow back (you should give them a biscuit as a reward for this). \n\nEven if you don't care about the deer the whole area is very scenic, there are loads of temples and shrines to explore, and the whole area has forest around it (nice break from the treelessness of Tokyo). It was a humid, crowded, overcast day when I went to Nara and I still loved it, I highly recommend going there during good weather.\n\nAlso /r/japantravel (READ THE FAQ BEFORE POSTING) was very helpful to me.",

    "body": "I'm an expat living in Greece, I've visited a bunch, I'd second Naxos, but also recommend the Ionian side with Zakynthos and Kefalonia. Zakynthos is super touristy in certain spots (navagio beach omg) but if you can find a small tour boat company to take you off to a nearby smaller beach holy hell, such beautiful white sand and azure water. Kefalonia is all around pretty, again certain spots touristy as hell, the Melissani Cave is incredible and otherworldly, but you do have to expect to queue quite a while to get in (I think it took us about an hour of waiting, but if you google the photos are accurate). If you want completely not touristy I recommend Amorgos in the Cyclades, which is a quiet off-the-beaten track sort of place, quite popular for Greeks to visit for vacation but almost no tourists, for a very authentic, quiet, relaxing break. Ammouliani is my equivalent for that in the north, we had a friend with a boat license and god it was so nice to just rent a small boat for a day with a picnic box full of food and laze on the beach, snorkelling, eating, napping, repeat all day. Something middle of the line between those extremes might be somewhere like Syros. If you go to any of the islands in summer I would actually recommend hiring a quadbike/ATV unless you want to carry your luggage around with you as you explore, they're a lot of fun, cool, easy to drive and great for the -not always fantastic- roads. If you like watersports definitely go for Naxos (kitesurfing, windsurfing in particular).",
