    "body": "I drove for Lyft/Uber last night but for the sake of this event, we'll call it my own little personal party. My 99\u00a2 store decorations totaling $3 help support that claim.\u00a0\n\nAfter 3 years of driving for these companies, and primarily on Friday/Saturday nights, I've never had someone throw up in my car. Until last night. \n\nI pulled up to a house in Northern Los Angeles around 11pm where a woman holding a booster seat was standing. She opened my door, started strapping it in, and said that she's \"helping the mom out\". So now I know I am driving a mother with a toddler. Cool. A couple minutes later, a man comes out and plops down in the back seat, as his wife stumbles through bushes holding the hands of their 3yr old daughter. The woman gets in the car, pulls her toddler up into the seat, and tells me, \"Please go.\" \n\nI start driving this mid-thirties, well-to-do, Asian couple towards their 20-minute-away destination and it takes only a few minutes before the silence is broken by the wife telling the husband that she is going to \"fucking kill him\". He responds by telling the toddler that \"mommy said funky\", prompting the toddler to repeat the word funky and then ask, \"Am i funky, daddy?\". They didn't respond. The mom then repeats herself, threatening her husband. He tells her that he, \"can't die, because he has to take care of the kids in the morning\" and that \"It's not his fault that you had 12 shots\" to which she mumbles some words that end in \"throw-up\". \n\nI interrupt the mumbling by telling them that in front of her are vomit bags. The mom thanks me, the toddler tells her parents that she's scared of me, and the dad asks if he can give me a stock tip for dealing with his wife. I say \"Sure\" as his wife cries out, \"Please don't\". He ignores her and begins by 'priming' me for his tips by giving me a run-down of why I should invest. The toddler asks, \"Am i funky\" to which no one responds. He then attempts to sell me on the department store world and how it's a hot market right now. The wife is gagging into the bag, while blindly slapping her husband. He pins her hand to his lap as he gets to the 1970s of why department stores are a great market. The toddler asks, \"Am i funky, mommy?\". The mom ignores her, instead choosing to finally produce vomit, prompting the husband to speak louder to cover the splashes. In between her gags, she is telling him that he either has to stop talking or kill her right now. He does neither, as the toddler hums to herself. We finally get home and the husband jumps out, unstrapping the toddler and booster seat as his wife climbs out and lays in her garden. The husband shuts my door, but i roll down my window to hear: \"I want to die here\", \"I think our driver is going to buy my stock\" and \"I *am* funky\". \n\nTLDR: A mom vomits next to her toddler while her husband sells me stocks and the toddler questions its funkiness.

It turned into a massive fucking train wreck, butchering the fuck out of it then some drunk guy in the audience was like LET ME SING IT FOR YALL so I said ok and he came up and was WAYYYYYYY worse, like as bad as you could imagine a horribly drunk guy could be singing. He totally took the spotlight off of how bad the band was, then when he sat down we jammed on the song with an epic guitar solo and we redeemed ourselves. Thanks drunken redneck \n\nEDIT: I forgot to mention, I tried to end it very quickly after the drunk guy got on stage and so I caught eyes with the bass player and we started playing an ending to the song but it was too late because our drummer was paying no attention to us and was singing \"SWEET HOME ALABAMA!!\" Along with the drunk guy into his mic, which made it even worse cus for a second, cause the bass and I (guitar) stopped playing while they were just singing over drums and my bass player looked at me and was like \"IT WONT DIE!!!\"\nI lol'd so hard and just kept playing",

The sober friend then drove us to Krispy Kreme where he got out and started pissing in the drive thru.\n\nWe got back and he said he was feeling sick, so he went to the bathroom and collapsed. It took 3 of us to lift him into the bathtub where he took his pants off and started vomiting all over himself. He stayed in that tub for too long. Our sober friend had to leave the bathroom because he kept talking about wanting to fuck her. We then had to lift him out of the tub so he could pee and we could clean his vomit and put him back.\n\nNow it's about 11:30 and he has somehow managed to walk himself back into the living room. He picks uo the pizza box full of garbage, throws it at us and yells \"I DON'T CARE IF I LIVE OR DIE!\" He then got a glass of water and kept saying \"Ya'll wanna see a magic trick\" and would then spit water everywhere. Then later he says it again and we all say no. He promises water won't be involved, so we say sure. He then just pulls his scrotum out and starts ranting about he every one can see his balls and he doesn't even care. He pulled his nuts out multiple times.\n\nMidnight hits and he yells, \"Let's drop the ball!\" And let's one nut fall out of his boxers. Then tries to kiss everyone.\n\nAt this point everything in the room is wet from him spitting water everywhere so we try to make him sleep. We put him on the couch and he keeps yelling \"I AM THE GOD MACHINE\" and whenever he would go to vomit he would just pick stuff out of the garbage can and try eating it.\n\nThe rest of us where all sober by the time the night was over.",

    "body": "One of my friends had a ranch out in Texas when we were young. Had a bunch of little farmhouses we'd crash in. So it's me and my bro in one of them one night, he's got the room I've got the couch, and he's up all night reading captain blood. I had a cold and went to bed early. \n\nFrom his perspective (it's a tiny house) - I get up at like 2am, walk to one corner of the house, another, making these weird sniffling noises cause of my cold. Finally he puts his book down to see wtf I'm doing, then hears me pissing in the bathroom (REALLY tiny farmhouse). He picks his book back up and hears a low rumble, escalate into a full roar. The window rattles, he feels a thrum in the floor. I was farting, hugely. It lasted about ten seconds and about 8 seconds in he was cracking up, crying from laughter. I'm still over the toilet but start laughing as well cause I hear him. I laugh myself awake, crawl back into bed, and say \"dude what are we laughing at?\" He starts to tell the story but I start farting again. \n\nI think I nearly burst a blood vessel laughing that night.
