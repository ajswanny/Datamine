I've been buying Creamy peanut butter all these years because you told me that was your favorite\"\n\nSo long story a little shorter, we both prefer chunky peanut butter by a large margin, but had been buying creamy for ten years because we both thought it was what the other preferred.\n\nReading that back, we're pretty boring people. yep :D ",

    "body": "I was a new graduate student freshly arrived in the US and very poor, and I couldn't afford a laptop, so the only way I could communicate with my family was to hit up the library and use a public computer to email with them. Eventually my girlfriend back home wanted to skype, and I wanted a little privacy for this if you know what I mean, so I set about finding the most private computer available to me in the library.   \n\nOn a recon mission the day before the Skype, I located a single computer in a conference room and the next morning got up at 7am to account for the time difference and walked into the conference room with my eyes totally focused on the computer. I'd actually walked most of the way in before I realized there was a group of people around the conference table having a ridiculously early morning meeting. The guy at the head of the table, apparently thinking I'd showed up for the meeting and that I was heading towards him, handed me a paper that said \"agenda\" and said he was so glad a graduate student had shown up, then launched into the most incomprehensible talk about electrodes and chemistry.   \n\nMeanwhile I know my girlfriend is sitting halfway around the world thinking we're going to have sexy time Skype and I'm blowing her off and I'm feeling desperate. But everything I knew about US culture was only based on movies, so I have no idea if I can just apologize and leave or what. I miserably sat down for the incomprehensible meeting, rehearsing all the excuses I can give my girlfriend when we talk later. I was barely paying attention. Eventually questions were directed at me and I confess that I'm a new grad student and I don't know much about the equipment they're talking about. Everyone excitedly tells me all about it and I still don't totally understand what they mean, except I'm starting to get that they're going on a research expedition to [an insanely exciting inaccessible dangerous place] and they're building a piece of equipment to bring with them. \n\nBy the end of the meeting I am part of the project. 6 months later I am in [an insanely exciting inaccessible dangerous place] helping to operate this equipment. I appear briefly in the background of a Discovery Channel documentary (only black guy within hundreds of miles so easy to spot). I happily transfer to this other lab and this other field for my fully paid and stipended PhD. I am considered a real go getter, mainly based on my arrival at an early morning meeting no one else wanted to attend. New major, new field, new life because I was too awkward to admit I had just been in the room to sexy skype with my girlfriend.\n\n*EDIT 1:* Broke up with the girlfriend but we're still friends. Have a new girlfriend now and have never told her this story for obvious reasons. Also my advisor doesn't know. He was the enthusiastic guy at the head of the table and he loves his work so much that he never questioned that a business major would show up to hear all about it and get converted to love it as much as he does. He's still exactly that oblivious and enthusiastic. He will probably tell my conversion story at my upcoming defense.\n\n*EDIT 2:* Thank you for my first gold ever, kind stranger!  And for all the kind comments!  I know how lucky I have been, I really do.",

My father, who probably had some doubts about my choice, arranged for me to spend a week in a civil engineering office owned my a friend of his.  I spent a week there and definitely knew one thing afterwards - that I *did not* want to become a Civil Engineer!\n\nSo... a couple of months later, I was walking through the centre of town and met the owner of the Civil Engineering company that I had spent the week with.\n\nHe says:\n\"Hey, 1000000CHF, how are you?  Still planning on becoming a Civil Engineer?\"\n\nI'm a bit flustered (as I often was at that age) and don't know what to say, so I say: \n\"No, actually I've decided to study eh... hmm... Computer Science\" (The 1st lie)\n\nHe says: \n\"That's great.  A career for the future.\"\n\nWe say good-day and go upon our separate ways.\n\nA few weeks later, while I'm actually sitting my final school exams, he calls me and says \"Hey, 1000000CHF, I'm starting a computer company, would you like to join?\"\n\nI say: \"But, but...  I'm about to start University to study Computer Science\" (The reinforcement of the 1st lie)\n\nHe says: \"Great! We'll pay your University and you work all your spare hours for us.\"\n\nSo I was trapped.  Because of my lies I ended up studying Computer Science in a top University and getting a great degree and postgrad degree while earning a full income on the side (this was the 80s).  \n\nBut the silver-lining was that I actually fell into a career that I absolutely love and never want to quit.  \n\nForty years later I still get enthusiastic about interesting new technologies and have created two successful I.T. companies that are still operating.  I'm actually in the process of creating another this month.  Despite the management tasks, I still succeed in spending over 70% of my time doing what I love - developing modern, quality software.  Clients and developers that work with me respect my opinions and are very often surprised at how I stay on top of the technology trends.  But what I really derive my career satisfaction from is knowing that there are millions of people out there using software that I designed and wrote every day.\n\nTL;DR: a lie and a reinforcement of the lie led to me having, and continuing to have, a very successful career in software development.\n\n\n\n",

I went home and told my mom I needed to sign up for it.  I was never good at athletics at this time in my life.\n\nI ended up going to the track meet, it was a 400m race I was entered in, I remember the moment the gun went off I immediately went into a mode I had never remotely gone into before, I was actually ultra competitive for once in my life.  I was neck and neck with another kid for the first place spot the entire race, and going into the final stretch I felt like puking and every fiber of my body was burning and he was pulling away.  Something came over me and I kicked it into psycho mode and pushed past him for the win and my legs felt like noodles and I collapsed and couldn\u2019t get back up.\n\nThat race qualified me for a regional meet, I did that one and won again in similar fashion, then went to the state meet and got my ass handed to me.  That started me down a long line of running long distance which involved being one of the best in the nation in high school and getting a scholarship to run in college, and trust me the training at that level consumes your life (100 mile weeks), so it was definitely my life at that point.",

They usually use the company designer, but one day one of his co-workers submitted an icon design for their new app (one my husband had worked on) and others followed. People kept submitting art, so they made it a contest (no prize, just glory). When he got home, he told me about it and then asked if I was interested in joining. That night I did a quick design, he fell in love with it, and asked me to finish it so he could submit it. So I did... \n\nTime passed, my drawing won, and they made it the app icon. Eveything was great, until the day his team was in a meeting with the company VP. The VP had heard about the icon competition and asked who had submitted the winning app icon. One of my husband's co-workers quickly called out his name before he could say anything. The VP was impressed and then said that he deserved a reward (money reward) for his work. Surprised and too embarrassed to correct the VP, my husband just stayed quiet. Not denying the information made everyone believe he was the artist. He doesn't have an artistic bone in his body. When he got home, he told me the story and gave me the money for my work. I thought it would end there... but it didn't!\n\nWhen their next app was ready for launch someone asked him to make an icon for them because they loved his previous design. He could have put an end to the misinformation then but he was too embrassed, so he said yes. He got home and asked me to make the icon, he even said he would pay me. I found the situation hilarious so, after laughing at him, I agreed... plus I was getting paid. \n\nThis has gone on for a while (about 3 years), I have made about 5 icons for the company under my husband's name. He has been pretty dedicated to keeping up the lie all these years. He has asked me about my process of thought when I draw, so he can tell his co-workers about his method. He asked me about my tablet and the program I use. He brain storms about the drawings with his co-workers and tells me what they want. And when I'm too busy to draw, he tells his co-workers how HE is too busy to draw.\n\nBy now it's our little secret and it has turned into an inside joke. Right now I'm supposed to draw a new icon but I have been so busy that I haven't had time. So when I see him playing games or chilling on the couch I tease him by saying, \"Shouldn't you be drawing right now?\"\n\ntl;dr\nHusband was too embarrassed to correct co-workers and company VP about a drawing he submitted for a company app that I had drawn. Co-workers now think he's an artist when he's really bad at drawing. He has kept up the lie by paying me to draw new app icons for him.",

    "body": "I have one. A good friend of mine did not have an umbrella on a very rainy day. One of her coworkers offered her a lift home. One lift home turned into two, then three, until he was shuttling her to and from work everyday for months. This coworker is also a very good baker, he would make these lovely cakes and pastries and offer them to her which she politely took, every day. Then one afternoon, on her way home, he stops and picks up his parents. He happily introduces her as his girlfriend. She was shocked by this title to say the least.They proceeded to invite her to a family gathering over the long weekend to meet EVERYONE. His parents, they were so nice, she accepted because she didn't have the heart to embarrass the guy.  She went to the gathering, met with other family members and he kept introducing her as his girlfriend. She never worked up the nerve to correct or stop him. Long story short they are now married.\n\n\nEdit: I did not expect this type of response for this story! I will address some of your questions. Yes, this is a very real story. The man is incredibly socially awkward. He liked his coworker for a long time, so driving her home and baking cakes was his way of \"working up the nerve\" to talk to a pretty girl. She always thought he was sweet and kind but since he was never forward with his feelings, she only saw him as a friend. I am outside of the U.S. so there is a culture difference for some readers. However, this is still a bizarre courtship story in my country. After the family gathering, they sat down and had a long talk about their feelings and expectations and he finally asked her out on a proper date. They went on to date for 2 years and have been happily married for the past 5 years. Some of you called it a romance between two socially awkward people, good observations. ",

I worked with a lot of people I really liked and admired for one thing or another and I just wanted to fit in with them. Compared to the stories they told I always felt like I had done nothing with my life or time.\n\nOne slow day stories are being exchanged and the conversation rolls back to me so I blurted out that I was a photographer in my off time and went on a long history about my years in photography with film and my own dark rooms. I told countless lies about the difficulty of transitioning from film to digital but still kept my old film cameras for certain types of shots.\n\nI fucked up. \n\nOf course everyone wanted to see my work, I weaseled and told them I would bring stuff in but of course had nothing to show. That night after work I went to bestbuy and maxed out my credit cards to get a lot of camera equipment, indent on a tirade of learning everything I could, signed up for community college courses on every type of photography I could sign up for. All so I could hide the mountain of shame I created. I started taking pictures every morning at dawn and every evening I could get out of work before sunset. I worked as an assistant to a wedding photographer for free for 3 months on top of all that to fill out a portfolio that hadn't existed up to this point. \n\nEveryone was so happy looking at my work that I couldn't bring myself to stop! I kept at it; I hiked trails that I didn't think I could hike just to get that perfect hard to find view of a sunrise the next day, I started doing weddings and parties by myself for free to capture the perfect picture out of thousands so I could show it off, I started traveling the world so I could validate the photography adventures I told stories of. \n\nIt's been a spiraling mountain of lies, but at the end of the day I discovered my love of photography through them and now it's my whole career. Three hundred sixty-five days a year and I have never been happier! ",

I needed a job so I dressed as best I could, which wasn't very well, walked into a bar on 7th and lied about my work experience. They gave me the job , I started working that day. They paid me cash after every shift. I worked there for three years, became the manager, and now I love cooking. Never cooked a day in my life up till that point.\n\nA lady, in her 50s,who was acting as the kitchen manager trained me. She knew I lied, but she also knew I was in trouble. I couldn't even cut a tomato. She saved my life. She didn't tell anyone and kept training me even though sometimes I'd piss her off but I always tried to do better. I got an apartment a month into the job using another cook to call the apartment and let them know how much I get paid cause they wanted that for some reason. I was getting paid $11 under the table so nothing was on record which is why he had to call.\n\nI worked as a line cook immediately. It was overwhelming. I'm not from the city and the work was fast paced. I would study on my time off by watching youtube and cooking at home.\n\nEdited for more info\n\nAnswers to frequently asked questions\n\nI became homeless at the age of 19, really. I kept bouncing around from couch to couch because I had a rough home life. I just wanted to get away, from Ohio, and moved to Charlotte when I was 20 trying to get a job as an audio engineer. It didnt pan out, but I didnt want to come back home so I stayed. I was homeless up until I was 22\n\nThe bar I worked at was a dive bar whose name cannot be mentioned. The ship sank a year or two ago, though I left there when I was 25. \n\nI do not live in Charlotte at the moment\n\nI cant make too many recommendations for where to eat as I do not think that is fair for you. I havent eaten at some of the places I normally would eat in that neighborhood and when I lived in the hood (Plaza Midwood) I only ate at home or anywhere that makes sushi lol\n\nThank you all for the absolutely lovely comments.

I was adding my contribution to the sign-up sheet when I noticed that one particular co-worker had signed up to bring brownies. She was a nice, single, older woman who had many pets at home (2-3 cats and as many dogs) and was regularly covered in a layer of pet fur.    \n\nThe day of the party had arrived, and everyone was going around filling their plates.

After a few drinks, I tell her, tearfully, that I have a confession to make - I'm not really allergic to nuts. She burst out laughing, thinking it was going to be something much more serious than that.

    "body": "In Vegas for a bachelor party. I was 21 or 22 at the time. Got wasted. Made a bet with a friend while we were out at the club: \"If you're wrong, you have to pretend to be British the rest of the night.\"\n\nI lost. I was British. \n\nMet a girl, who started talking to me because she overheard me saying some bullshit to my friends in a British accent. She thought that I was British. I went with it. \n\nI slept with said girl. Had to wake up hungover the next morning and continue to be British. She said that we should hang out again that night. Sure. Meet said girl, and she's brought all of her friends - who all think that I'm British. So I'm British again, but around more people. My friends are dying every time I talk. One tried to be Australian around the girl's friends, but was called out for being a fraud. \n\nMy fraudulence continued to go unnoticed. Had to answer all kinds of questions about my life and childhood. I had never been to the U.K.  Fortunately, I was an English lit major, and also watched a 3 or 4  British movies. Mostly Monty Python. Thus, I was more or less an expert on all things British. \n\nI got tired of doing the accent. So I started saying deliberately incorrect things about England to see if someone would call me out (more fun than randomly admitting it). Turns out that 21 year old American women are too dumb to know a fucking thing about England, so they were incapable of pointing out my bullshit. \n\nI like to think that, to this day, 12 years later, there are girls out there who think that the British invented tea and only drink it on Wednesdays, that Cromwell was a benevolent leader who gave out free pheasant to the impoverished Irish, that James Bond was written by an Indian guy, and that the only reason that Brits are known to dress nicely is because it's illegal to not wear a tie on weekdays. \n\nThe accent took over my mind so completely that, when a guy in line at that restroom said something to me (in a very clearly English accent), I instinctively responded in an English accent.  He got excited. I realized what I had done, but just went with it. He introduced me to his friends (mates). They mentioned that they couldn't pinpoint where I was from. I told them my mom was American and I lived half my life in Maine (bullshit), and that's why I have a strange accent. They went with it. \n\nBrought the Brits back to our group. So now I had British homies. My friends couldn't believe it. I've entered British Level 5,000. So many level ups in so short a time. \n\nFucked that girl again. Even talked dirty to her. Didn't know how to talk dirty Britishly. I said \"I've come\" instead of \"I'm coming.\" Thought that the present perfect made dirty talk sound more British than the standard present continuous. I laughed at my own bullshit. The British are coming, indeed. \n\nI admitted to her the next day that I wasn't British. She didn't believe me, and refused to accept that I was American. So fuck it, I was British for another half a day. \n\nThanks Maggie, for the good time, and for believing in me. That's when I realized that I really could be anything that I wanted to be. \n\nEdit: words\n\nAnd more: thanks for the feedback. Honestly, the story is a lot crazier and more convoluted than this, but it would take a book to write it. I even had a Mrs. Doubtfire restaurant scene moment where I had to oscillate between British and American on the same casino floor. I wish I still that girl's phone number just so I could call and be like, \"Hey! Remember that English guy you fucked in Vegas 12 years ago? Well, about that...\" \n\nI even imagined a scenario where I unknowingly got her pregnant, and when the kid asked her about his dad, she'd tell him, \"He was a charming gentleman from England, sweetie. I received a letter saying that he died at Waterloo.\" \n\nAnd morer: Guilded! (I mean gilded. FU autocorrect). Thousands of upvotes! My most responded-to comment ever! Obligatory: Thanks for the gold. ",

    "body": "Oh hey a question for me!\n\nI lied about attending University for 2 years while living at home\n\nStarted out by missing a class here and there, falling behind, getting depressed and stopped attending full stop, told everyone I was still attending. Spent time in netcafes playing games, waiting until next semester where I would buckle down and work hard. Next semester came and I just kept spiralling down due to depression, ran out of money as I was barely working so I stopped going to the netcafes and stayed home (usually spent my days on my laptop hiding in my walk-in closet in case my dad came to open windows or something as he worked from home), and when I had a few close calls I stopped doing that and spent my time in libraries mostly. \n\nConstantly lied to my family and my girlfriend about how my day at uni was etc, and whilst over the first year I still had the intention of fixing everything and turning my life around by going back and getting good grades etc but eventually I resigned to just going with the flow with the acceptance that I'll eventually just kill myself (so I was stringing everyone around me on with this false life that I never had the intention of finishing). Started losing control of my mental state and was always in a panic, cried myself to sleep at night etc, started to lose control of the lies in November last year and decided to say fuck it and come clean, cause worst case scenario I can still kill myself if things don't go down well.\n\nCame clean to my (now ex) gf first and she really struggled with it (it was all at once over text so I don't blame her)\nCame clean to my parents the next day, and they were so unbelievably supportive. I know my dad was angry about it but he never took it out on me and worked through those feelings himself/with my mum. I owe my current (much better) life to their love and care and I will always be so grateful for them.\n\nMy gf never really could come to terms with it and I don't blame her. Looking back on the relationship I don't think we were a great match anyway and I was mostly hanging on for stability I didn't really have otherwise.",

Normal nine year old thing to do, right? But there's only so many sore throats and headaches and runny noses you can fake before your parents or whoever else realizes you're full of shit. So, I got creative. \n\nI really had no clue as to what symptoms I was inventing or if there was even a name for them. I would pretend to faint, to freeze up all together, and a variety of other things. Naturally, my mom took me to the doctor who referred us to a neurologist. The neurologist did a couple of tests and based off the sleep deprived eeg exam I had, determined I was experiencing seizures. They diagnosed me with epilepsy, prescribed me depakote, and called it a day.\n\nBetween admitting my building lie and taking the tiny pills that my mother would reward me for taking with ice cream, I chose the ice cream. \n\nAt 13, several years later, I decide I'm tired of playing this game and going to these appointments etc. But instead of fessing up and admitting what I had initially done, I simply threw the eeg tests that served as the determining factors of my continued diagnosis. I walked away from the last eeg confident that this would not come up again. In fact, later in life I had a rather morbid joke that -- considering the whole debacle --  it would be quite ironic for me to die of a seizure later in life. \n\nSo a couple years back, now in my late 20's, I'm eating lunch with my boss is typical -- and then next thing I know, I wake up in a van, quickly realizing it was in the inside of an ambulance. The EMT tells me, \"Hey there! You had a grand mal seizure!\"\n\nIts actually happened a couple more times since then. I'm still going through constant tests to try and figure out what might be going on. \n\nGuess I have epilepsy now.",

After filming, the whole group of us were drinking someplace and met a couple of British girls. During the conversation, I ended up telling them that part of the reason I even got past the first bit of try-outs was by doing a Scottish accent, just to make the producers think I was a tiny bit more interesting. (My Scottish accent is *OK*, but it's basically Mike Myers doing Shrek.)\n\nWell, they were all interested in hearing it, so I laid out a couple of sentences. After which they excitedly told me it was really *quite good*, and then quickly devolved into saying things to me in a Scottish accent I *could not understand at all*. Turns out they would tell Americans they're from London, because 'Muricans don't know crap about the UK, but they were really Glaswegian or something. Holy hell, the change in their speech was incredible!",

To look cool, act like you're just standing or waiting in line and there just happens to be a board with wheels under you. Looking at your phone while riding helps this.\n\n4. When riding on a crowded sidewalk, yell \"PASSING LEFT/ RIGHT\" and don't be scared to push people over when they turn around to look. They'll just know you're a badass and shrug it off.\n\n5. Dismount is important. Sometimes I just jump off and let my board slam into whatever building I'm going into. You can also push the tail down to the ground and skid.

His coworkers, knowing that he knows some Hebrew and has a Jewish son, assumed that he is Jewish too.  Rightful assumption, but..... he isn't.  He never told them, and has kept up the ruse as a joke.  Upon meeting his coworkers for the first time, I unintentionally outed him.  He then responded with a joke about how I wasn't Jewish, confusing me, but reinforcing the belief that his coworkers had that he actually *was* Jewish (clearly, he and I had an inside joke about who was the more religious).  So, even after I point-blank told his coworkers he isn't Jewish, they still think he is.  My dad has also gotten Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur off for \"being Jewish\", and still gets the Christian holidays off since everyone on his side of the family is Christian, so his boss lets him take those days off to spend with his family.",
