    "body": "I've probably got more than a year left in me, but with Stage IV colon cancer who knows. I'm actually in a chemo infusion right now. The only thing I honestly want is to spend every waking moment with my young children. The thought of them growing up without me, without knowing who I am, is probably the thing that weighs most heavy on my mind. \n\nBut as far as actionable list items, I need to climb a mountain again. I grew up near the Rockies and have backpacked and hiked all through the southern Rockies. I keep thinking about when I'm done with chemo seeing if I can't bag a few of the simpler peaks nearish the Denver metro area. I'd like to start a group in Indianapolis with this or similar hikes/climbs in mind, but haven't done so yet. I'll look into starting this though. \n\nAlso, if anyone else in the Indy area needs anything, please DM me. I'm doing okay and would love to help someone in need out. Great thought OP!\n\nEdit: Thanks for all the ideas everyone. I'm going to look into getting a small digital video camera that myself or my wife can grab whenever to record what we are up too with the kids. I'll capture a lot of cell phone vids as well, but that can be cumbersome when trying to get an event. \n\nEdit2: Thank you kind stranger for the gilding. You are much too kind and I wish you all the best\n\nEdit3: Sorry it took so long to do it, but I've tried to reply back to everyone who responded. I will keep trying to do so if anyone wants to keep a conversation going. I will be attempting to get an Indy hiking group together and maybe planning a CO trip for some indeterminate date in the future. You are all extremely kind and good people and I wish a million, billion blessings on each of you. \n\nEdit 4 (Sept '17): You people are amazing. I get asked how I'm doing and the answer is really good. Chemo is working better than anyone expected and the oncologist is pretty excited by the lack of progression of the tumors. I'm not asking about a 5 year survivability number though, because having a statistical bookend to your existence sorta makes me worry about it a whole lot more. I'll keep living every moment I can though! Thanks all!",

He's been struggling with his own health issues for quite some time and landed in the hospital this weekend. He's been given 30 days to live. He's not in a position to fulfill any bucket list items, but I think it would be a kind gesture to flood his final days with cards, flowers or other sentiments. \n\nEdit: Thank you all so much for your generous hearts. The response to this is incredible and has gone farther than I could have imagined. \n\nI've attempted to PM each of you to share the mailing information. If I have missed anyone, please take a second to PM me for the details if you'd like. \n\nThe family doesn't know this is coming. My hope is that it will bring some smiles and a bit of peace during this tough time. One important note that a few have pointed out; because he's in ICU, the hospital will only accept Mylar Balloons and Cards at this time. I'm hoping they will make an exception for anything else this wonderful community has already sent. Thanks for the prayers, kind words and positive energy.\n\nEdit 2: Unfortunately, Ramon \"Ray\" Figueroa joined his Parents today in Heaven. I sincerely appreciate the outpouring of fellow Redditors putting pen to paper to try and make his last days a little bit easier. I've been in contact with the hospital to try and make sure all the beautiful cards, postcards and other well-wishes are collected throughout the weekend and next week for his family to see. I can't thank you all enough for your generosity. There is definitely some good hearts out there amongst us all.",

    "body": "Not me but my grandmother. \nMy grandmother on my mother's side is a Korean citizen living in Korea. She is my last remaining grandparent. She is currently hospitalized. \n\nKorean culture is such that many of nursing duties that are not strictly medical in nature must be performed by a family member. This leads to the expectation that a family member be at her side. \n\nMy father was taking care of my grandmother when there was a situation such that doctors had reason to believe that her liver was failing and therefore needed to be sent to a major hospital. MY dad approved the ambulance to take her to the hospital (as the ambulance fee is not fully covered by the national health insurance, if a family member is present, the family member must consent) \n\nHeeding the doctor's advice, my father approved the ambulance which incurred a charge of around $90. Once my grandmother gets to the hospital, my uncle calls and throws a fit about how my father loves to waste money and does not know how things work in Korea. (My parents lived in America; I still do) He accused the doctor of milking the system for money and my dad for falling for it. (unsubstantiated) He raised hell in front of everyone until my father offered to pay for it out of his own pocket instead of my grandmother's health insurance fund despite the fact that both my father and my grandmother(once she was stabilized) believed that the decision was a good one. \n\nWe all know the reason why this is happening. My uncle thinks that my grandmother will blow all his share of the inheritance on medical costs and sees my dad as an enabler. My grandmother has been feeling sad but her depression is getting worse as she realizes many of her children have already written her off and sees her as only a potential bag of money they have to try to redeem. \n\nI think my grandmother just needs assurance that she matters in some way. My dad and my mom are caring for her but they are only two people, both of who work much more than 40 hours/week. I just wish there was something that could be done. \n\nShe was born into poverty and colonial oppression, experienced life in one of the most horrific wars in history, and still managed to raise 4 children, one of who was deaf. She has continually sacrificed for her children, was basically married off to a borderline retard who came home drunk every night and endured life in a society where this was all somehow her responsibility to bear. I think that after all these decades, she just wants be loved before she goes away from the world. \n\nEDIT: Wow, I did not expect this to blow up like this. It is 2 am in SK right now so getting contact would be.. difficult but I'll try to get the hospital address ASAP. My grandmother will all be touched by so many people reaching out. Thank you. ",

    "body": "My dad was diagnosed with stage 4 pancreatic cancer this spring. He's gone through two rounds of chemo and so far it has actually done a good job of shrinking the tumors. He's pretty miserable while doing chemo but he has reasonably long stretches between treatments when he feels fine. Based on his age and overall health, he could live more than a year, maybe a couple years. But it's pancreatic cancer... we are not taking anything for granted.\n\nHe's already taken a trip to Italy (where he was born), and he's visited or made plans to visit many old friends. We're all doing our best to just do everything normally. I will grieve after he's gone, not before.\n\nThe one thing he really, really wanted that he never got was an old Volkswagen bus. He used to own one, years ago, but had to sell it for various reasons. Around 20 years ago he bought a \"restorable\" one. Basically a rusty shell. He paid a local VW mechanic thousands of dollars over several years and did lots of free database work for him, but the guy was a total flake and took him for a ride. He managed to get back about half the cash he paid, but of course no work had been done, and he was also out all the time he spent working on the guy's database. Several years later, the mechanic died in a shop accident, and that was that.\n\nHe sold the shell some years ago for a few hundred bucks. It had been sitting in our driveway for years doing nothing.\n\nNow, old VW buses (specifically the split-window ones that he loves) have exploded in price, and not only is it not feasible to do a full restoration on one, he can't even really afford to buy one in rough but drivable condition.\n\nI thought about looking up local VW clubs and seeing if anyone would be willing to lend their bus to us for a day or a weekend or something, but I'm not sure if that's realistic. I don't know if anyone would be willing to lend out their rare and expensive classic car to a total stranger. On top of that, I'm afraid that even if I do manage to score a VW bus for a weekend, it'll only lead to him feeling worse because it's not *his.*\n\nSo I'm not sure. I think I just wanted to talk about this. I still think he would love to drive one before he dies.\n\nEDIT: Before anyone goes too nuts, I still need to contact the Twin Cities VW Club and find out if they know anyone who would be willing to lend us a bus or ride along or something. They seem to have a good number of meets through the summer so maybe we can find something. I've just not put a lot of effort into this yet because I wasn't sure if my dad would want to. But if I can get something arranged ahead of time, I think he would really enjoy it.\n\nAlso, thanks for all the well-wishes and support!\n\nEDIT 2: Going to a VW club meeting tomorrow evening to talk to some people and hopefully set something up. There were tons of other great suggestions and offers in response to this post that I am looking into as well. One thing is for sure - I will definitely get my dad behind the wheel of a VW bus, even if only for a little while.",

I'd really like to review movies, like, on YouTube. Like [Chris Stuckman](https://www.youtube.com/user/ChrisStuckmann) and [Half in the Bag](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL34C1F26D03F5F9B8) and [Jeremy Jahns](https://www.youtube.com/user/JeremyJahns) and [Beyond the Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/user/BeyondTheTrailer) et cetera.\n\n\nI always wanted to be in movies and make movies and be on the stage, and I'm probably not going to get to realize that now. But I love talking about movies, too, and I think...maybe...I could do that well. And that's most of what I do at home--I sit around and talk to my mom and my friends about movies--so if I made a bunch of videos of that, she'd have them once I died, and it'd pretty much be like I was there, which she would like, and knowing that would make me feel good too. And it'd be way more fun putting thoughts and videos together if it felt like you people were watching, 'cause that's how my brain works I guess.\n\n\n**TL;DR**: I registered a YouTube channel for movie reviews, and if, well, you cool people who have liked this post did two more clicks and subscribed to the channel, and then I guess went and liked a few of my stupid videos once I get it set up, if you want--even if it was just out of like, pity or charity or whatever 'cause it's dumb...well, that would be pretty wizard. And that doesn't seem like too much of a pain to ask you guys, does it? I mean, Redditors are good at clicking and stuff.

    "body": "I got sick and kept brushing it off. Ended up having congestive heart failure that I had ignored because I just thought I kept getting the crud getting passed around at work.\n\nI was given a 50% chance to make it a year because my heart function was so low. Ice made it farther so that's great. But when it was really iffy the only thing I wanted to was pay off my car and all the medical debt I was getting because I didn't want my family to have to deal with it. I was super close this year. I only had $5k left on my car and paid my medical stuff off leaving just a personal loan I had to take out when I missed a ton of work and some lady hit me on the highway on my way home and totaled my car so I've had to start over there.\n\nIt's been a rough couple of years but if anything I've made it a lot longer than expected. I know people who had way fewer and less severe issues than me that didn't make it. Being completely honest there's nothing crazy on my bucket list that tanks higher than making sure all my stuff is taken care of so my dad won't have to if something happens. Having my dad in the hospital room finding out about all my heart issues and the fact that they weren't expecting great results was probably one of the worst days of my life. I was only 26 and my dad and grandparents had a really hard time with it.\n\nEDIT: sorry there isn't much anyone can really do. I didn't read the what can we do.",

The generosity from everyone for such an obscure thing is tremendous. It makes me now regret not creating a GoFundMe project, as recommended by another MDS patient. If the generosity shown here is any indication of things, the world isn't as bad as the news makes it seem these days.

It's against this subs rules to post the link directly, so if you'd like to have the link, please PM me. I didn't expect to do this, but the support getting these two books that I wanted to read has been so overwhelming, that I'm simply inspired right now to ask for small amounts of help from anyone who has the means to contribute.\n\nAdditionally, everyone should consider following the other great ideas here and donate blood or register as organ donors.

I dropped out of school a few years ago and I've been super depressed and anxious and trying to get my life on track for sometime (even before this).\n\nI always felt something was wrong with me and kept asking to get scans by my doctors but never had any symptoms until a high LT blood test warranted ultra sounds. \n\nApparently that's a thing, where people can walk around with growing cancer and not even know until it's too late.  \n\nthought being diagnosed with something would allow me to pinpoint the problems I have  instead of my ambiguous suffering, but now I realize this probably had little to do with my low energy and severe paralyzingly anxiety since I've had that for years and it was just exponentially getting worse.\n\nAnyway, now that i know I'm fucking dying, it's the exact opposite of the sort of breaking bad liberation I might have expected. I used to fantasize about death, sort of daily. But in a different way.\n\nNow, just knowing I'm going to die soon has given me a new type of horrified consciousness. It's so scary. I'm so terrified.  Everything will end.  Reality will end.  I will end. I can't have anymore time. It's impending death.  Forever.\n\nDeath is really scary. It's clear how much i ignored and objectifiedit until forced to confront my own. \n\nI'm so scared, so scared and so alone literally all the time. I don't know what to do. I want to explode.  I need help, divine help, yet I don't believe in God or supernatural shit. I'm so scared. I'm so scared. I'm so scared.\n\n---\n\nUpdate/edit/whatever: good morning.   thank you for all the messages.  I am actually feeling quite relieved in this moment to see that strangers care and are this good intentioned.  I'll respond to you when I have a moment. \nConcerning the few who sent me prayers: I did not mean to imply condemnation for religion or God and I totally appreciate your prayers.  I actually feel that there is something to all that stuff, somehow; but I grew up without religion and don't believe in the soul or God or an afterlife, from what I know of that--but I know literally nothing about that stuff either.  I just wouldn't be able to buy into it.\n\n(On the other hand if I could find a guru and go to India and achieve enlightenment or have Buddhists guide me to death in the Himalayas I would totally want to do that).\n\nI don't know even what I'm saying right now, I'm so unbelievably not lucid it's like I'm living through a screen and I really hate complaining so repetitiously.  But seeing these comments is making me acknowledge how genuinely nice you people are, and kind hearted, and empathetic that you can recognize my pain right now and that thought itself is getting me out of my head if even for a moment.  Thanks again. Talk to you soon.\n\nI appreciate any advice. Any words really at all. I'm so fucking lost, I really don't know what to do. I'm now immediately feeling overwhelmed again, it's just too damn much.  I'll also come back and update this post more (I guess, I don't really know how to reddit) but it would be cool to get more ongoing advice because I really don't have other people in real life.  This is in a weird way like a permanent panic attack at this point, and A part of me wants to kill myself to end the overwhelming nature of it all but no I want to live. I just can't wrap my head around dying. Around anything.  My brain is blocking itself and blocking itself from blocking itself.  I'll stop writing before this goes even more off the rails.  I don't know what to do, even moment to moment anymore.  I'm not equipped to deal with things, never was, and perhaps it's fitting that my body is failing me like this.",

Botched surgery and poor post-op care resulted in permanent nerve damage, that on my best days feels like I'm being slapped in the nuts every 10 seconds and someone hitting my leg bones with a 5# sledge hammer. On some potent opioids but it only takes the edge off a little bit for a few hours a day. \n\nBeen kickin' it like this for just over 13 years in hopes of medical advancements, but due to this happening at work the Workman's Comp insurance won't pay for stem cell treatments which apparently do work, and Medicare won't cover it because it's still \"experimental\". Would be great just to have pain levels cut in half, amazing if I could walk without a cane, a miracle if I could go hiking, run or ride a bicycle, and work again. \n\nI just keep hanging on at this point for my family because my older brother took his own life in 2005, at age 34, due to not being able to get clean (meth) and my younger sister died in 2013, also at age 34, due to a long illness. I currently have custody of my sister's 15 year old son who has gone through Hell, having been essentially (and legally) kidnapped by his biological father who ran off with the babysitter when nephew was a year old, then once he got awarded custody after divorce proceedings, stuffed his son in a boys home rather than actually raise the special needs kid he stole from the only family he ever knew. But I fought for him and the father & stepbabysitter finally agreed to give me temporary custody and I've had him for about 18 months. He's supposed to get Social Security Survivor Benefits but it goes to his father, and they pass it along to me but they keep a huge chunk for themselves and don't pay any child support, so as you might imagine it's pretty tough to get by on that and my small monthly disability check. I'd have the SS Survivor Benefits sent directly to me, and I could have that done, but the father would just take him back and stuff him in another boys home to be abused more and I refuse to let that happen, so I make do.\n\nSo as I opened with, not technically dying but certainly feel like it. My only wishes, which I doubt anyone can help with, is for the biological father to actually support his child and for me to receive stem cell treatments so that I might be able to get my life back, and get back to working so I can build that life. Maybe even find a good woman, get married and have a family of my own. At age 40, that's looking less and less likely to happen, so I guess just pray for us if that's your thing.",

    "body": "I would like to encourage all parents who know that they are going to die to tell their children the truth as soon as possible.  My mom suffered from ovarian cancer for around 4 years before finally losing the fight.  The weird thing is that she always believed that she was going to make it, even during her final two weeks when she was lying on the hospital bed with bloody fluids being drained from her lungs.\n\nThe sad part is that even though I was technically an adult of 22 years at that stage, I was so naive that I also believed that everything was fine and that she would be better in no time.   The shock was so tremendous when it finally happened that I was completely caught off guard and traumatised for years afterwards.  \n\nFor outsiders during the late stage of her cancer it was completely obvious that she was going to die, but her positivity meant to protect her children also caused us to be completely ignorant.  Deep down I know that she wanted to shield us from the inevitable hurt, but at the same time not knowing the gravity of the situation made me feel as if I missed a lot of quality time which I could have spent with her.  \n\nI was angry for a long time at her, at my family for not being more honest about the situation, and at myself for being so completely blind to what was right in front of me.  \n\nPlease let your children know so that they may give and get the love that you and they deserve in your final days.",

It is now in my bones, lungs, liver and in my skull. They told me I had a year and a half left but that was two and a half years ago. I'm still truckin'!\n\nI have had an amazing life. All those bucketlist items don't mean too much to me now; I just want to spend time with friends and family. I have learned so many lessons from this 'adventure'. Sometimes, I can't believe how lucky I am to be surrounded by so many good people. Cancer gave me a new perspective and I sometimes cry with happiness that I was able to live my last months in gratitude. Even a post like this, a complete stranger trying to help out a 'termie' touches me. So thank you, OP. \n\nYou know what I would love for someone to do for me? I would really and truly love someone out there, even if it's just one Redditor, to do something kind for someone in my name and send me a pic or tell me what you did. The thing that is most important in my life, the one thing that means most to me, is acceptance of others. Racism, sexism, homophobia - it all breaks my heart. My entire adult life has been dedicated to advocating for immigrants - before I became ill, I worked as an English as a Second Language teacher and as an immigration counsellor and LOVED every moment of it. It upsets me so much to see someone who has fought tooth and nail to escape persecution, arrive in Canada (or any country) and face even more adversity and discrimination, which in this current political climate is a very real issue. \n\nI would love for anyone reading this to do something for someone who could benefit from an act of kindness, which really, is any human being and tell me about it!  It would make me feel like I can still contribute something positive to the world and I know it would make me cry those happy tears I mentioned earlier.  Thank you!!!!\n\n",

    "body": "My grandfather just passed away 2 weeks ago from stage 4 lung cancer. I just wish I had more time with him.\n\nSeeing all the awesomeness in this thread despite the horrible conditions that has befallen some of the posters has made my day brighter. \n\nFor everyone who is coping with a passing in the family, I want to share my favourite quote that I first saw on Reddit about grief from /u/GSnow\n\n>*Alright, here goes. I'm old. What that means is that I've survived (so far) and a lot of people I've known and loved did not. I've lost friends, best friends, acquaintances, co-workers, grandparents, mom, relatives, teachers, mentors, students, neighbors, and a host of other folks. I have no children, and I can't imagine the pain it must be to lose a child. But here's my two cents.*\n\n>*I wish I could say you get used to people dying. I never did. I don't want to. It tears a hole through me whenever somebody I love dies, no matter the circumstances. But I don't want it to \"not matter\". I don't want it to be something that just passes. My scars are a testament to the love and the relationship that I had for and with that person. And if the scar is deep, so was the love. So be it. Scars are a testament to life. Scars are a testament that I can love deeply and live deeply and be cut, or even gouged, and that I can heal and continue to live and continue to love. And the scar tissue is stronger than the original flesh ever was. Scars are a testament to life. Scars are only ugly to people who can't see.*\n\n>*As for grief, you'll find it comes in waves. When the ship is first wrecked, you're drowning, with wreckage all around you. Everything floating around you reminds you of the beauty and the magnificence of the ship that was, and is no more. And all you can do is float. You find some piece of the wreckage and you hang on for a while. Maybe it's some physical thing. Maybe it's a happy memory or a photograph. Maybe it's a person who is also floating. For a while, all you can do is float. Stay alive.*\n\n>*In the beginning, the waves are 100 feet tall and crash over you without mercy. They come 10 seconds apart and don't even give you time to catch your breath. All you can do is hang on and float. After a while, maybe weeks, maybe months, you'll find the waves are still 100 feet tall, but they come further apart. When they come, they still crash all over you and wipe you out. But in between, you can breathe, you can function. You never know what's going to trigger the grief. It might be a song, a picture, a street intersection, the smell of a cup of coffee. It can be just about anything...and the wave comes crashing. But in between waves, there is life.*\n\n>*Somewhere down the line, and it's different for everybody, you find that the waves are only 80 feet tall. Or 50 feet tall. And while they still come, they come further apart. You can see them coming. An anniversary, a birthday, or Christmas, or landing at O'Hare. You can see it coming, for the most part, and prepare yourself. And when it washes over you, you know that somehow you will, again, come out the other side. Soaking wet, sputtering, still hanging on to some tiny piece of the wreckage, but you'll come out. Take it from an old guy. The waves never stop coming, and somehow you don't really want them to. But you learn that you'll survive them. And other waves will come. And you'll survive them too. If you're lucky, you'll have lots of scars from lots of loves. And lots of shipwrecks.*  ",

My fiance who lives in England (I'm from USA), we've known each other for years and plan on getting married soon, but she does have some crippling diseases she's developed recently. Myocarditis ( inflammation of the middle layer of the heart) and Churg-Strauss (EGPA) which causes inflammation of blood vessels, being the main two. We found out during a normal checkup about a year ago, the doctor found scarring in three places on her heart, so we canceled a 3 month trip for her to come to America otherwise she would've died in a couple weeks. Got started on Chemotherapy immediately for three months which I visited for instead to support her. That helped relieve the myocarditis to a dormant state. She's been on some basic steroids (Azathioprine) the past year but has been getting weaker and weaker. After more scans and tests they've found her bone marrow has been deteriorating and decide to put her on a monthly injection of Mepolizumab. So far it's been helping her tremendously and has taken away her own personal stigma she felt from taking multiple pills a day, but the hard part is the cost. There, she has the NHS and it's free. Yearly cost in America can be $12,000+ and I'm only 21, lost my job three months ago, living off my savings and generous friends/family who offer dinner or other small needs, job market in my area is very sparse. I've been considering joining the Navy to help pay for this, I had good grades, smart guy, dad did nuclear work for the Navy before and right now it pays very well and I believe I can shoot straight into that line. But the biggest thing of all this is just hearing her hurting every day and worrying about our future because doing all this at my age with only a high school diploma and now no income is hard. We're going through the process with USCIS (Immigration Services) to get married soon and it's been hard. I don't know what to ask for other than just some emotional support for us because we've wanted this for about 5 years now and the future of her health is very uncertain. ",

I chose the latter, as I know my girls will be looked after when I am gone. That brings me joy. My only regret is that I am not alive long enough to make them a nice place to live.

But they didn't know if I would make it to 1. I was 1 lb 2 oz I was adopted 6 months later by an American family, right after I got out of incubator care. I weighed 4 lbs. The nurses there told my parents that I had hip dysplasia and could be fixed. They got to America only to be told that I had cerebral palsy, pretty severe. They prepared my parents for the worse, that I wouldn't be able to walk, or talk, and if lucky I would make it through high school (don't expect college to be a goal) with the amount of damage done to my brain. They said I would maybe even be a restrained to a wheelchair, needing help with everything. I walked when I was 4 almost 5. All by myself. I struggled with math. I struggled to look myself in the mirror because I was a product of a woman who did drugs and smoked and did damage to her baby and now I was stuck with the consequences every day. I was severely bullied because of my CP. I had two major surgeries one when I was young and another when I was older to help my gait and ability to walk. I graduated high school with a 3.5 GPA. and I'm graduating college in a year. I can walk and even run. I have had 16 year of physical therapy to help my muscles stay loose and all that good stuff. And I have almost made it to 21. I pushed myself and now I hike mountains and workout in my free time. Even though my balance is a huge issue I don't let that stop me. I can even rock climb. Anything is possible. Don't give up. I felt like this subreddit needed some happiness because I was sobbing my eyes out reading through all of these. Y'all give me so much strength. ",

Have had nine rounds of chemo, seven surgeries, two rounds of a clinical trial drug, and I'm currently undergoing palliative radiation to five metastatic lung lesions. I'm on the waiting list for another clinical trial but the success rate of phase one trials is even more dismal than my five year survival chance.\n\nAverage life expectancy for a person with my cancer is 8.5 months and June 1st was the second anniversary of my surgery so I've done a lot better than the legion of docs ever expected. I have crossed a few things off my bucket list. The whole family went to see the original cast of Hamilton on Broadway last year (before they were even nominated for any Tony Awards). I got a tattoo. And I tripped on mushrooms. THAT was fun. \n\nMy husband and I went on our honeymoon to the Caymans in 1994. We have always wanted to go back and take our kids but it's wicked expensive and has proved to be logistically difficult to schedule with work, school, treatment, and life in general. We're working on it. \n\nWe are going to try and catch the total eclipse in August. That is a family camping trip planned with my brother and his family. Mostly I just like to do the regular every day things. I made my two best friends from high school quilts and I've given away some other things I've made that I think will mean something to people who got them. \n\nDying is not scary. What is scary and upsetting is knowing the heartbreak I'll leave for my husband and my kids. Every big day in their lives - when they graduate, when they get married, when they have their own children, when they accomplish any goal they've set and reached any milestone - will be tinged with sadness because I'm not there to see it. I would like to see what my kids will look like as adults. I would like to hold a grandchild. I would like to wear a silly hat and walk along the beach with my husband when I'm an old lady. I don't want my husband to live the rest of his life alone. \n\nBucket list stuff is fun but it's not what really matters. ",

Have the person tell a story about middle school or when they hitchhiked across Montana or got naked on a golf course or when they and their cousin snuck off to see the Beatles.

Unless the dying person expressly forbids a   visit, *please* go see them. Act normal. Laugh, bring something to eat if possible, play music, just hang out. Don't tiptoe around with kid gloves just cause they are dying. Be a friend. Don't fall into that trap of \"I want to remember Aunt Irma as she was\". That's cruel.

Hard to say how long I actually have, could be a months, hopefully years. I had surgery almost exactly a year ago to have it removed, but surgeons were only able to get 5% out (enough for a biopsy). I went through radiation and have been on chemo for the past year. It's pretty rough sometimes and sometimes I feel great. Losing my train of thought and being forgetful are the most frustrating side effects. \n\nWhile staying positive is difficult, I find anything that limits my stress and keeps me active helps the most. I spend a lot of time with my dogs, playing golf, and maintaining my little weed garden. I enjoy my hobbies, but I really miss having friends. My dad was in the military growing up, so I never had a 'hometown' and consequently not many lasting friendships. Most of my close friends live far away, and most that are near aren't comfortable around me like they used to be. It sucks ass and I understand, but I miss how everything used to be. \n\nTo be honest, I never made a bucket list. I thought my life was just beginning and now, I live in a kind of purgatory. If I could have one thing though it would be the chance to start a family. I want to be a father more than anything in the world. \n\nAsking for help is something I don't like to do.

Who knows, if I try really hard I might even beat this thing, have a kid and tell them all about this crazy mess. ",

I've also seen people write out cards and noted for every bday that they will miss. It might be heart breaking, but I know that your kids would love and cherish those cards/videos for their entire lives. Might be something to think about. Maybe even recording a video of a hike, and guiding/showing them the world through your eyes. Something that will stick with them no matter what happens to you. Hope this helps.",

His job at the time and some memories I keep from my childhood. But I have no knowledge of who my father was in the past, as a young man. My only advice would be to tell your kids about you, who you were, what your dreams were, stories that forged you into who you are today, challenges you overcame, your best memories with your friends, your hopes, experiences in school, things you did with your dad when you were young. Hell, anything they can hold onto while growing up that will give them a sense that they knew you and that their father was more than just a parent; he was a man just like them, with issues and insecurities and a thousand other problems, same as them.",

Just talk to them about yourself. My dad never really did. I have no idea how he saw life if everything had been normal. No idea what he hoped for us as we would become adults. He wanted to live life normally, which I respect, but I miss that the most. The 'adult' conversations, simply because I was awkwardly between an adult and a child at 13 years old. My brother can remember even less of him.\n\nSo please, write letters to them if you don't feel that they're at that age now where you can say these things. Write letters for their high school graduation, for when they marry, their first child. Write letters about yourself. Perhaps buy gifts now for their important birthdays. \n\n I feel now like I didn't truly know him, only him with cancer. I was at the funeral and the speeches were about a person I hadn't known. I'm 20 now, and I looked up old friends of his to tell me stories. I wish I would have heard it from him. \n\nEDIT: I never expected this to get seen, but I would like to add on a little since this comment has blown up. At the age I was when he was alive, he was 'daddy'. Compared to how my relationship has changed over the years with my mom, I wish I could have heard more stories about his life. My mom told me about when she experimented with drugs, her first break up, serious relationships she had had, funny stories from when she was young, how her relationship was with her parents, and so on. She told me how they fell in love. This I would have loved to hear from him. Just the life experience he had. I know her know as a full person, not 'mommy' any longer. These stories will keep you alive in their memory. These are the stories they'll pass on to their grandchildren and partners. ",

EDS means whatever tissue it affects gets really stretchy, doesn't shrink back, and is generally weaker - they have hyperflexibility, can freely dislocate and relocate joints, etc. However, because of the vascular kind, her life expectancy is about 40, because her heart or any of her major veins could go at any time without warning, and it's basically instant death. Because of it, she also has a large aneurysm on her heart, ready to go at any time.\n\nI had to do a lot of soul-searching and thought to whether or not I wanted to stay with her, since her body is a ticking time bomb and she can't have kids. It was a very rough decision. I ended up deciding to stay, because if the only complaint I have about our relationship is her health, doesn't that mean we're a pretty good pair?\n\nWhat also helped was realizing that was just her life expectancy. She could die tomorrow. She could live to see 70. I could get hit by a car on my way home today. Odds are just that - odds. They are no guarantee, and you can't live your life in fear of them.\n\nIf she does go before me, though, I have no idea what I'll do.

Would be cute, and something to have to look back on. Would also be nice for grandpa to have in his house or hospital if the time comes.\n2. When your son is a bit older, get one of those let's go fish toys with the little fake poles and set it up in the backyard or whatever and invite grandpa over.\n\nI know it's not real fishing, but these might help in making something close, and having the memory/photos to keep forever when he's not here anymore. Hope this helps! \n\nEdit: Wow thank you so much to whoever gave me gold! I feel so honored that so many people liked my ideas!",

If not, head to your nearest large academic center to have a hepatology appointment to discuss it. Of note, everyone should be an organ donor unless you have beliefs against it! And yes, people with hepatitis can donate organs--in med school I helped remove a liver from a lady with hep C to give to another person with cirrhosis, resulting in my first needlestick injury. Hep C is also treatable, guys! Harvoni is awesome.\n\nEdit 2: It also occurred to me that I should differentiate between Hep C and cirrhosis caused by Hep C. Cirrhosis is an end stage of many liver diseases characterized by fibrotic tissue (hard and woody tissue) that doesn't function normally. The liver performs many functions, including detoxifying, making proteins, making and breaking down sugars, and making clotting substances so you don't bleed too much. When you have cirrhosis, your liver doesn't do this anymore. We don't have any medicines yet for reversing fibrosis (fibrosis is the end stage of a lot of diseases in other tissues, too, like the heart and lung), so if you have cirrhosis, we usually think about whether transplant is an option for you. \n\nHepatitis C is a virus that can lead to cirrhosis. There are different genotypes, and some of these are treatable with medicines, but some medicines work better for some types. Some of these can be used when people have cirrhosis.",

She tells me the treatment worked so well, they had to switch everbody over from the placebo group to the treatment group. He wears some kind of battery pack that sends a low level of electricity through his brain (as it was explained to me) that keeps the cancer from growing. The trial was through Duke and Sloan Kettering, and the device was made by Novocure.  Look for that trial and see if it is appropriate for your finance.  If you can't get in, see if you can get some kind of compassionate use to get the machine.  God bless. ",

One thing that might help you is guided meditation exercises online (they helped get my depression under control). If that doesn't work, open a window occasionally and take time to breathe in some fresher air. We all have a limited amount of life to live. Try to see the little things- pictures of puppies (or the preferred baby animal of your choice), the smell of flowers, the feeling of a really comfortable t-shirt, the taste of a particularly nice cup of tea, coffee or flavored beverage of your choosing. If it's possible, try to go on a small walk or two and enjoy the sky, listen to some nice music you like, whatever makes you happy. \n\nI wish I could do more to help you, if I lived nearby I'd drop by with homemade snickerdoodles and my WiiU.

All of them just made me wish even more that I had known him from more angles and at more ages. One of the most moving experiences of my adult life was visiting the town he grew up in. Aunts and Uncles, childhood friends, random strangers on the street who recognized me just because I looked like him... it was hard to take ten steps without an emotional moment. \n\nAs a kid I never asked questions about my parents and their own lives. Kids can be so self-centered that we forget that our parents are people with their own lives, and that who they are can be such a large part of who we are. Now my list of questions I wish I could ask my dad is soooo long...",

I saw him after the letter in hospice and he said \"(name) sounds like your death not mine\" . We tried to see him more in hospice but his gf (who we were all ostracized by )stopped it and wouldn't let me/siblings go in to see him except for an odd 30 mins visit a couple times.  So we waited in the living area of hospice. When we ordered a meeting with the social workers, nurses, etc because we want to see him and have someone with him while he was dying (not able to communicate at that point), they agreed we could go see him a bit but we opened the door to the room and the nurse came in and said he died. Moral of the story is...sometimes it's not wanted nor accepted but I'm so very happy I said something in my letter. Even though the response was hurtful. It's your only chance to make peace.",

I am haunted daily by the fact that she died without being able to hear that I truly loved her and that I was sorry for being the moody kid I was and that I appreciated everything she did for me.  I would give anything--ANYTHING--to have a conversation with her before she hit that point to let her know these things and see what she had to say to me.\n\nTo anyone dealing with this right now, heed this thread's advice.

Some people have conditions which mean we can't give blood, and we just have to suck it up and find other things to do.  Check to see if you are eligible to sign up as a bone marrow donor, for example, since the requirements there can be different and the process is different too.\n\nUnfortunately I'm not eligible for either, so I don't know what I can do other than signing up as an organ donor (which I am eligible for despite being barred from other things, for some reason).  And I did that on the NHS website not two minutes ago.\n\nLate edit: [Here is the form to sign up as an organ donor.](https://www.organdonation.nhs.uk/register-to-donate/) You fill out contact details online, a couple preferences, and that's it.

    "body": "I used to be super needle phobic, just seeing a needle on TV would make me want to faint. I'm now a regular blood donor. Here are some tips:\n\n-Hydrate! Lots of fluids beforehand. In the morning, in the car on the drive over, while you're waiting. \n\n-Eat something! Don't forget to eat before you donate. You may feel bad before routine blood work because you're fasting, but you must eat before you donate blood.\n\n-Don't look! Don't look at the needle, tubing, anything that makes you uncomfortable. Just close your eyes, go to your happy place, and let the nurse know that you're fine, you just don't want to see anything.\n\n-Educate yourself about the blood donation process. The entire visit to the blood center may last an hour, but giving 1 unit of blood means the needle is in your arm for about 10 minutes. That's 10 minutes of minimal discomfort that could save up to 3 lives! Also, if you donate through Red Cross then you can use Rapid Pass (starting with your 2nd visit, I think), which takes care of some of the predonation questions that are required with each visit. I've gotten in and out of the donation center in 40 minutes.\n\n-Hang out in the chair when you're done and get up slowly. If you hydrated beforehand and you get up slowly then you should be fine, but don't push yourself. Enjoy the free cookies and don't forget to hydrate!\n\nEdit: now with paragraph breaks (hopefully).",

    "body": "I don't know your situation but I watched my 52 year old uncle die of cancer a few years back. He was an avid hunter and talked about having a \"hunting accident\" so that he wouldn't have to go through everything that was coming. \n\nI wouldn't have blamed him if he did. He didn't end up doing it and I'm glad he didn't. That process that he chose to go through was horrible and sad and really hard to watch. But in a weird way he gave his daughter and siblings more time and now when we sit around and tell stories about him we talk about all the good times before he was sick and we talk about the good times towards the end and there's just something about those stories specifically that are almost healing in a way. We all saw how horrible it was and how sick he got, but when we talk about the funny things he did in those days we get closer. \n\nHad he gone out and had that \"hunting accident\" we wouldn't have those stories. We wouldn't get to talk about it, I can't imagine we would be able to broach the topic of his death at all and there's no healing in that. \n\nAgain, I don't know your situation and I can't tell you what you should do or what the right thing for you is, but from someone who has lost a close family member long before anyone expected, this is my experience with it.

    "body": "very topical for me as my 13 year old cat will be put down today. as i write this i am spending my last few hours with him.  He is struggling to breathe from a pyothorax from coyote/cougar bite.  So the choice was to operate (50/50 odds with an unclear recovery window) to clear his lungs, or let him go.  I am choosing the route of compassion, though i really didnt want to give up on him.  He has had an awesome life, and i dont know if he would put up with 4 months of prolonged recovery.  Very very hard decision, made hard because it wasnt just being terminal, there was a road of possible recovery, but he could have gotten sicker at any point.  I just dont think he would want that, not living like a cat",
