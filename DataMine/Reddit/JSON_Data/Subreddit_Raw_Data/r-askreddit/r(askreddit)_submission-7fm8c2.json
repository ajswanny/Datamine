So what happens here is that we create a new instance of String ('username checks out') and send it as an argument with the message \"show:\" to the object \"Transcript\".

In season 3 (2013) he was dominating the other pro players at the worlds tournament like it was a cakewalk. He had a rough 2014 season, but has generally been regarded as the best player in the world for four straight years now and has won three world championship titles out of the four he's played in. That feat is astonishing in itself given how drastically the game can change over time and no player has ever managed to come close to his peak performance level or consistency. \n\nHis South Korean fans started calling him the \"Unkillable Demon King\" in 2013 and shortly thereafter the western fans ended up just going with \"God.\" \n\nTL;DR he's the Michael Jordan of LoL.\n\n",

    "body": "I'll take a shot at this.  Faker doesn't make many mistakes.  Most players make a lot of mistakes so when they eventually pile up bad things happen (their character dies is the most common one).  These mistakes allow the other team to pick up small advantages that turn into bigger advantages over time (usually amassing gold leads that give them overwhelming advantage eventually).  Since faker doesn't make many mistakes he doesn't give his opponents many options to gain advantages.\n\nThe biggest way that people gain advantages on faker is usually due to very high level skilled plays.  Since he doesn't give people many openings he pretty much only dies when he gets surprised by something (seems this way to me anyways).\n\nTeams will frequently spend a great deal of resources trying to keep faker down.  Two and three man ganks are common against faker and he somehow stays alive throughout (hence his old nickname, the unkillable demon king).  So he soaks up an enormous amount of pressure while frequently giving up very little (maybe some cs). During this time, his team has been amassing advantages elsewhere on the map or even worse for the other team fakers team is coming behind them to even things up after he's absorbed all that pressure and getting kills where they didn't get any kills.\n\nThese are just his defensive abilities.  Faker seems to be able to play a very high number of champs at an extremely high skill level which is uncommon.  He seems to know how to get the most out of the champs that he plays.  Frequently just barely eeking out kills seemingly out of nowhere because he knew exactly how much damage he had to do and knew he could do it beforehand.  He surprises people frequently because he makes plays that they wouldn't have thought of in order to use a champions kit to its fullest.  There is a famous clip from a game (last year I think?) that faker called something along \"I got them\" in comms like 4 seconds before he even went into the teamfight.  He used a rotation of his spells and completely decimated the opposing team turning it into a rout.  That kind of foreknowledge is ridiculous.  I'm okay at the game and I'm lucky if I respond to an opening that I see half a second earlier in a complicated teamfight.  \n\nTl:dr  Fakers defensive game is possibly the best in the game.  He absorbs an insane amount of pressure allowing the rest of his team to get ahead.  And if you don't pressure him he outplays the opposing teams mid and instead snowballs the game all by himself.\n\nEdit:  I feel like I should mention that I'm actually not a faker fan.  But there is no denying that he's probably the best league player ever.  He's just been at the top of the game for too long at this point to say otherwise.  It's possible that there will never be another league player that has a better career then he does.  One of the posters in this thread compared him to Michael Jordan.  It's a pretty good comparison.",

I don't hold any of these things against them, it's not their fault they were dealt a shitty hand in life. \n\nI've had clients try to stab me, throw their own feces and urine at me, punch, kick, and bite me. I have patches of nerve damage in both arms from being bitten. When I was pregnant I was pushed down a flight of stairs. I also had a client kick me with both feet in the stomach, 2 days before I went on mat leave (I was 36 weeks). I caught the kick with my hands and deflected so it barely hit my belly.\n\nI had a client cum in his hand, sneak up behind me and slap me across the face with it. I had to walk off to take a few minutes after that one. I had a client reach between my legs and grope me, he had been sexually abused and was extremely sexually aggressive. He functioned below a 2 year old level. It was horrible. That poor kid.\n\nYou learn to take it in stride. I'm a pretty mellow woman, which helps a lot. I do have to take time for myself though.

Now, this boy had been sexually assaulted by family members. So he had some unusual masturbation habits. He was fisting himself in the shower. He was told to stop by the staff, because he had no concept of safety and actually damaged his rectum.\n\nHe reacted angrily. Smashed the mirror and attempted to stab the staff. I got called for help. We had to do a floor restraint for almost 20 minutes while he calmed down. He was naked and covered in feces, cum, and soaking wet.\n\nI threw up.",

So this kid on his first trip to the shop, he's done accompanied trips, he's done trips where someone drives along behind him or when someone watches from the window, it's taken a few months.\n\nSo he goes, everyone waits inside and 15 minutes later in he walks, giant grin on his face, holding a mars bar above his head like a gold marathon medal. It's a tiny thing for most people, but this kid is 17 and going to the shop on his own just never seemed like an option in his life. ",
