My skin turns a horrendous red where the blisters are and it\u2019s pretty painful and horribly horribly itchy too. Places that get more sun exposure are tougher like my hands, but I pretty much have small itchy bumps on my hands all year long but only a few at a time. Arms, chest and back get it the worst. Then the face and legs and hands and feet. The longer I stay out the worse the blisters get. It also makes me really really tired. A couple of times I\u2019ve had quite bad abdominal pain too or digestive problems. And tmi- but when I get too much sun my urine starts turning quite dark which is why they are testing for porphyria. It\u2019s pretty f\u2019ed up. \n\nHere I am today.
