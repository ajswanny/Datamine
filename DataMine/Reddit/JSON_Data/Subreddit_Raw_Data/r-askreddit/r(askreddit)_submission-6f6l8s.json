Our German Shepard came over, convinced me to walk outside with him and started licking my hands, looked at me, and ran away jumping the fence and he never came back. He was so loyal and good that to this day noone believes me and thinks he was stolen because he would never leave. \n\nI'm almost certain he did that because he didn't want us to see him die and he wanted to go to the massive forest area and do his thing. I miss you buddy\n\nEDIT: Wow some amazing replies here. I'm glad to know all our pets love us in this way and that they care like they do. Much love \n\nEDIT2: Those of you wondering why noone believes a kid on something that does happen a lot was that we lived in Iran at the time and the dogs (especially rare purebreds) we're usually stolen so my family thought it was a result of that.

The only reason it caught my eye was because the parking lot was empty save 1 or 2 cars besides mine, and it was like my pushing the door open also pushed a button to trigger the bird to take off, the timing was perfect.\n\nSo I'm walking down the sidewalk, and I'm watching this seagull fly in my general direction following the edge of the lot, when it gets to the corner and turns so it's going to fly *directly* over me.\n\nI think to myself \"No way....\" and sure as shit, (heh. heh.) I see this seagull drop one in midair just before it gets to me. It's flying a good 20ish feet in the air, so I simply sidestep and watch as this giant blob of bird shit liquid splats down on the ground, perfectly where I was.\n\nSo this seagull saw me walk out the door, and instantly decided it was going to try shit on me.",

We both grew up with this cat. She'd sometimes follow us and watch over us. My parents used to make jokes about how she thought of us as her kittens. \n\n\nNow, my sister wasn't very nice to me. It took a lot of people a lot of time to realise she wasn't just nasty; it was full on abuse and bullying. My sister is a narcissist, but that's not what you need to know. When I was too young to understand what was happening, I used to talk to Princess. She was like my version of a diary; I'd sit with this creature that was older than I was and tell her all my problems. \n\n\nOne day at a store, my mum told us she'd buy us each a lolly. My sister wanted a different one to me, and grabbed my arm and clawed her nails down it so hard it drew blood. Hurt a lot and I was really upset. When we got home I went and cried to Princess about how scared I'd felt. After a while I calmed down and went and played with my toys. Princess ambled out of the room. A few minutes later I heard a shriek and she ambled back in. Turns out she'd walked up and scratched my sisters hand, then hissed at her before coming back to sit with me, and watch over me playing with my toys. \n\n\nMy parents assume that my sister provoked her, but I know. She walked out of the room right after I'd been talking to her, and walked in right after the shriek. I can't prove it, but I think Princess saw how scared I was and showed me that she'd protect me. I've never told anybody about my white and grey guardian apart from my currant cat. \n\n\nI haven't thought about Princess in a while. She lived to be between 19 and 21, depending on how old she was when my parents got her (she lived with them for 19 years; was around two when they found her).  I loved that cat. Funnily enough, my new cat was originally my sisters. She got him, then left him with my parents, and he slowly became mine. He likes to sit with me more than he likes her. ",

His hair is a mess, standing on end. His clothes are all over the place, not ripped, but disarranged. Like he walked out of a bomb blast but he cleaner. He's looking around, silently, clearly confused. Homeless people were really uncommon in my area then and tended to be couchsurfers rather than streetsleepers. He looked too well to be a street sleeper plus he didn't seem to have a clue where he was but he turned left and wander off the my left before I crossed the road. \n\nThat night, local news comes on.

The whole thing had a funny feeling to it. Also this isn't a region where that is always a helpful move. I was actually pretty gun shy at the time because I'd been a witness in an assault case and it had resulted in severe life consequences for me with little outcome for the victim. \n\nHe wasn't wet.

I peered from behind a corner in my hallway and never let her out of my sight. I was beyond afraid. She calmly sets the pen down, shouts thank you from the dining room, and then walks out the front door. I bolt to the window and make sure she's gone, then I bolt to the door and lock it. Then I nervously and very slowly approached the note she left on the table. \n\nI read it and was dumbfounded. She said that she believed god spoke to her in the garden, and told her to build an alter to her grandmother. The note was her scheduling an appointment with my mother to discuss placing a tombstone and a prayer table or something in the garden. \n\nMy parents got home and I freaked out, I told them my mom had to talk to this woman. She left her phone number on the note. My mom took the day off work, sat out on the porch at the time the woman said, and waited for her to arrive. She never showed up. My mom called the number on the note, only to get a disconnected message. The only proof I had of any of these things happening was the note she left.

We watched it then move diagonally to the left then back to centre, diagonally right and then back to centre. \n\nDuring this we discussed the possibilities of what it could be, a helicopter, a skilled pilot, a series of spotlights? The speed at which it moved and the fact it didn't waver slightly and the fact the motion was so fluid left us without an explanation.\n\nAs we discussed and watched the movements, the light moved even faster up, down and diagonally.

We saw lights appear out over the water and move towards shore, it was rotating so the lights along its edge could tell us how fast it was spinning.  It came toward us and was hovering a few hundred feet offshore, while the lights starting speeding up. It started moving north slowly, but spinning faster and faster. All of a sudden it just took off at an insane rate of speed. When it finally disappeared over Barnegat Lighthouse we went back to check our poles. When we started reeling in our lines, both of our lures were on the beach behind us about 30 yards down the beach. We were using striper lures as well so they needed probably 3 ounces of weight, So there's no way when we casted the wind blew it back behind us and onto the beach.  I also remember the clock said 11 30by the time we got home, and I didn't think we spent 5 hours down there fishing. We used to talk about that all the time when he'd come visit the shore house, my parents would just laugh at us. Unfortunately he killed himself a year and half ago so I can't get any more details. I'll never forget it though, one of my best memories with him. Rip Jay ",

    "body": "I'm not a superstitious person so I've completely ruled this out as a strange coincidence. Still when it comes to things, this series of events is by far the spookiest. This all happened within the span of a two weeks last year.\n\nFirst, I was walking home extremely late from work. I worked until about 3am had decided I'd take the long walk home that night. Not too strange for me as I used to live in the country and go on late night walks down dirt roads. Theres something about walking in eerie atmospheres that relaxes me far more than any other kind of walk, not sure what. Anyway, I took a road that went away from the city and into the woods so there wouldn't be any cars zipping past as I walked. Next thing i know, I hear a rustle in some trees. I look over and see someone about 20 feet in the bush with a perfectly white blanket sat on their head.\n\nI froze and looked at them for a moment then slowly kept walking as I clutched my multitool in my pocket and flipped out it's knife. After I continued for a few moments they simply took off into the woods and that was that. Gave me the creeps, pegged it as a homeless guy or a teenager fucking around on drugs.\n\nThe next night. I decided to walk to the store around 11:30pm. It's a good walk so I'm not back until around 12:45. I live in a really nice neighbourhood and right next to my apartment is a small convenience store that closes at 11pm. As i approach my apartment I see this girl dressed in all white, head to toe. White heels, a nice short white dress, a white fur vest, a massive white hat. Her hair was blonde and she even had a long skinny cigarette. She looked like she just left a fancy 30's costume party. She simply stood in this empty convenient store parking lot and payed not attention to me as i passed. Why she was in the middle of the closed lot, I have no idea but once again this sort of gave me the creeps. Especially after I recalled the previous night.\n\nSo I get into work monday, tell some people of my strange encounters to spook them out. Everyone tells me to stop walking at night, I decide its probably a good idea and jokingly say \"I don't wanna risk running into the third white figure OooOOo\".\n\nThe next Sunday. I realize i'm out of toothpaste and hop in my car and drive to the store. Driving back I approach a stop sign with a cross walk. The roads is completely empty at this time of night, but i come to a complete stop, I always do. But apparently I wasn't really paying attention because the moment I pressed the gas, someone stepped out  onto the crosswalk and i quickly hit my breaks. I immediately gesture an apologetic wave to the person and I realize its a kid. Not just any kid, an albino kid. He didn't seem to notice my mistake and just slowly strolls past my car. I was already a little flustered from my inattentiveness, but for a brief moment as I thought about the two people I had seen before and how I had joked about there being a third... I nearly shit my pants I was so creeped out. \n\nGot home and immediately thought of it all as a coincidence. I had never seen an albino person before so that made the last one especially shocking to me. But I don't walk at night anymore haha.",

My parents basement was/is unfinished and we had a small tv and a single couch in the middle of it for my siblings and I to go play games, watch VHS tapes, whatever.  \n\nOne night I decided to hang out down there by myself and watch some movies and I ended up falling asleep on the couch. While asleep I was in a dream where I was in the exact spot I was in in the basement, watching tv on the couch when something asked me \"What channel are you watching?\" Still in the dream I turn and say \"channel 13\" to a short alien sitting next to and staring right at me. I of course wake up in the empty and now dark basement (I'm sure my parents came down to turn off the lights and tv) and am frozen in place for a moment until I hear something behind the couch.\n\nI sat up to turn around hoping to god it was our old dog and there it was, the alien from the dream rising up about 2 feet from behind the couch and walking toward me. I'm sure I let out a blood curdling scream as I bolted upstairs and right to my parents bedroom. Everyone including the dog were up there and to this day I believe what I saw as crazy as it sounds. (It doesn't help that my mom and sister say they've  heard things constantly in the home for years like people waking around all hours of the night when everyone's in bed)\n\nTLDR Fell asleep with an alien asking me questions in a dream only to wake to \"it\" standing behind me.",

Quickly, I called for my friends in the house and they brought out a garbage bag and a shovel. We poked the cat with a shovel looking for any identification or sign of life - none.

Doctors thought I was making things up as a kid, or talking about floaters, so I dropped it. It wasn't until college that I discovered the name for it.

It was one of the best moments in my life when I found out I wasn't alone or crazy.\n\nI've become used to it since it's just a part of who I am, but the other symptoms/side effects like migraines and tinnitus are incredibly annoying.

    "body": "I grew up in Florida, and have seen my fair-share of weird stuff, but this takes the cake.\n\nWhen I was about 8 or 9, me and my older brother went on a walk in our neighborhood. At the end of the street that our house was on we both saw a man in a doctor's coat and surgical mask, walking very slowly and awkwardly like in a limp, while holding his side like he was injured. Both me and my brother thought this was some weird shit and decided to walk in the opposite direction, back home. \n\nA couple of years later I was playing basketball in my driveway and saw what looked like the same man in the doctor's coat and surgical mask, except he was riding a unicycle pass my house on the road. He didn't look at me, just kept staring straight ahead at the road, riding his unicycle. And a year after that I swear I saw the same man riding his unicycle just days before I moved away from that house.\n\nWhenever I tell people this now, they kind of give me a weird look and don't really know what to say. It's one of those weird things that's too obscure to make up but too ridiculous to think it actually happened.",

As i became older (6 years old) i used to feed him biscuits as well. I would hold a biscuit out of the window. He'd be sitting on the sill and gently take it from my hand.\n\nNow fast forward many years and i am in college. I used to sleep late on weekends (till noon). Now Kaga(crow) had a habit of waking me up at 7am in the morning, right time for me to have breakfast and give him some part of it. In college it was annoying to hear him kaw loudly at my window(above my head), so after waking up, and still sleepy, i told him i cant wake up this early, please be quieter next time. And ill be damned. From the next day, he wouldnt start cawing his head off. he would start softly... slowly he would increase his volume. I miss him :( He did when a cyclone hit my city. He was very old and blind in his right eye (cataract)",

Then there was a rustling on the other side of a fence. We had a clear line of sight between the campsite and the fence and this weird cougar/dog/human looking thing climbed over fence with its knees and arms bent at odd angles (almost 90\u00b0) then it was over the fence. It stood up on two legs and ran to the left into the campgrounds. It was terrifying. No one has ever believed me, but my dads now exgirlfriend still remembers, and looking into the urban legends in Michigan i came across the story of the dog man.

Like, if NBC was covering a basketball game, they'd have a satellite truck set up at the arena beaming up to space. The satellite would then beam that down to Earth, so that your local NBC station could pick it up and transmit it across its broadcast area. It was up to your local station to then put in advertisements during breaks and whatnot.\n\nHowever, if you had big dish satellite, you could sometimes pick up those raw feeds. Supposedly you'd end up hearing the commentators just BSing, the cameraman aiming at random things, etc.",

Usually if someone has drowned and the body isn't recovered, it's left at that only becuase that's the last known thing the person was doing or was seen doing. The guy may have not drowneded, but been through some other sort of bizzare incident after his water activities. \n\nA friends' father was a recovery diver for 25+ years. On more than a few occasions individuals missing and believed to have drowned while boating, diving, swimming, etc were found wandering nearby, or disoriented and traumatized far downstream, often hours or days later. Divers, especially cave divers, consistently go missing and bodies aren't recovered for months or years, but their remains are almost always just assumed to be in their last known area. In one occasion a diver his recovery team searched who had for suffered some sort of medical issue while on a lake dive and made it out of the water and into the treeline a few meters up from the shore before collapsing dead.",

I'm driving my friend home around 2 or 3 am and as we approach her intersection there is a woman walking along in the right lane of the street that I'm driving along. I'm supposed to be turning right onto my friends street soon but I switch out of that lane to avoid her and my friend and I kind of mention that was weird. One of us suggests maybe she's blind or sleepwalking and I decide to U-turn around to see if maybe I can help her, but I feel very strange about the entire situation. I stop in the left lane closest to where she is and roll down the window a peep, debating what to say and she starts walking towards us with her arms forward, almost zombie-like, but more so as if she was trying to feel something. Her eyes looked closed when we first saw her, but now they seemed slightly opened or white-ish, and both times she was sort of smiling. I had an instant body feeling of, oh fuck we gotta go, as one of us says \"this is not good energy\" and I just bolted out of the intersection and told my friend to sleep over at my place tonight.\nStill have no idea what this was exactly and when we mentioned it to my friend's brother, he said he's seen that woman eating soil some while ago across the street from their house during the day. No one knows if she lives in the neighbourhood but she is not an immediate street neighbour since they all know each other.\nTheir immediate next door neighbour has apparently seen a woman, unspecified whether it looked like this one or not, \"fly across\" the street. To be fair, he's a stoner and drinks a lot but a grown ass man was scared out of his mind at 2am and came running to my friends house telling them this story. From what I recall, she was on his side of the street walking along, he looked away for one second and she was all the way on the other side of the street, like an impossible distance for a few seconds in front of someone's eyes.\nAnother neighbour who's lived in the area since he was a child and is about 50 now has apparently seen this woman every so often and she \"hasn't aged\". I kind of wanna find out more about this witch-like person cause this all seems insane and very eerie with a lingering bad energy and in a way the closest to something \"paranormal\" that I've experienced.",

Most of the trip was rained out, and consequently I spent a lot of my time playing Pokemon. At this time, I had both Yellow and Red version, the former of which was new. After stomping the Elite Four in Red version, I swapped the cartridge for Yellow. I didn't touch the Red version for the remainder of the trip. We packed our things, left the hotel, and drove back to PA -- without my Pokemon Red. I was distraught because I put a lot of time into that game, but to no avail: my parents reached out to the staff and they couldn't find anything, so I went without.\n\nFast-forward one year and we are on the road heading back to Ocean City. We stayed at the same hotel in a different room. There was some issue where our air-conditioning unit was spitting out the cigarette smoke from the couple beneath us, so the hotel staff allowed us to swap rooms for free. We coincidentally ended up in the old room. I immediately went to the bedroom and looked at the area where the bed met the headboard. Holy fucking spaghetti sauce: my Pokemon Red was wedged perfectly into an opening on the headboard. I liberated the cartridge and waited until returning home. It was my game, complete with my prized level 100 Charizard, unevolved Pikachu, and a mirror image of Ash's team (Pidgeot, Lapras, and even a Muk). God, I'm pretty sure that moment was the first time I ever had an erection.",

I looked to see what it was and it was a pale blue ball of light floating straight down slowly. \n\nI rubbed and blinked my eyes to make sure I wasn't seeing things, but it was still there. It was coming down over a field about half a mile away. I wondered if it could've been a flare but I'm not sure if there are flares that are light blue and fall that slowly.\n\nAnyways, I freaked out that it was an alien ship and called my cousin to go investigate it because he lived close by and I couldn't be late for work. I had to hang up on him because I freaked myself out even more thinking that the aliens knew I saw them and were going to come get me, so I pulled over to the side of the road to vomit then rush to get away from there. \n\nNeedless to say my cousin didn't find anything and any time I tell someone about it they're just like \"oh, that's weird\". \n\nEdit: according to all the responses, I've came to the conclusion that it was ball lightning, although I still believe there is other life out there.

A lot of the time cats can be extremely attached & affectionate to their families even if they often pretend to be indifferent. Not showing emotion is a defense mechanism cats evolved with. If they get hurt in a fight then displaying pain/injury gives a sign of weakness to the predator they're fighting with.  \n  \nThe gray & white kitty I have now, Teddy, has been extremely attached to me since the day I got him when he was 9 weeks old (He's 7mo now) When I leave he follows me to the door, looking all sad and watches me drive away from the window. Then when I come home I yell \"Teddy!\" and he comes zooming as fast as he possibly can going \"Meow! Meowww meow meow!!\" He starts purring loudly, I pick him up so he can headbutt me and rub his little white cheeks all over my face. I hold him on his back like a baby and as I scratch his back/ears he reaches a paw up and rests it on my cheek while slow blinking + purring. One time I came home and he was outside on the screened in back patio. I went into my room to finish some eBay listings, he didn't know I had came home. After ~20min he came slowly walking into the room for a snack, all sad mopey looking. Soon as he saw me on the bed using the laptop his little ears & eyes perked up, he came running over saying \"Meeeeow Meeew Meeeoooowww!\" Jumped up on the bed and rubbed all over me, so he didn't know I was home and was so happy to see me. He follows me everywhere I go. When I watch movies/shows he snuggles up next to me and watches too. When I'm working on something he sits on my lap and \"helps\" with his little paws. We're definitely like two peas. Sometimes when I'm home he acts all indifferent/independent and won't let me snuggle him, but I know he's just pretending. When I'm sick in bed I know he can tell, because he never leaves my side. He'll bring me his toys and stuff too.   \n  \nMy ex-girlfriend and I had 3 cats. Every one of them was super affectionate, they loved snuggles, attention, & purrs more than anything in the world. When we came home from work they'd be waiting by the door and would get so excited to see us. Cats definitely can be just as attached, affectionate, and caring as a dog can. ",

The dogs had free reign of our 1/2 acre fenced in yard. One day, I let Jack outside like any other day but I noticed the trees were FILLED with crows. The property is surrounded by several large trees and there must have been hundreds of crows. As I'm in awe with the sheer amount of black death surrounding my home, I realize there is a MASSIVE crow on the ground and Jack is challenging him, growling and circling the bird. He was about 12 lbs and I was afraid he'd get carried away. Then all of a sudden the battle began. He was biting the crow's wings and the bird was pecking him and trying to grab him with one foot still on the ground! Crow king gave no shits! All his hundreds of crow followers were bursting into caws and shrieks egging on their leader but never joining in. \n\nI, meanwhile, was screaming for my brother, freaking out thinking our dog would be killed. He came running out of the house screaming for Jack to come but that bastard never listened. That's when Kuma came barreling out of the house straight towards the bird-dog battle arena, grabbed the crow king by the neck, and shook that fucker with fiery disregard for his onlooking horrified subjects. \n\nThe crow king was dead. \n\nThe skies filled with crows and the sound was deafening as they all flew away. Hundreds of pisssed off crows all cawing and flapping away. Jack's face was all cut up but other than that he was fine. To this day, my older brother and I are the only ones that saw this shit happen and no one in my family believes me when I tell the story of the crow king and his defeat.\n\nI think it was a crow fight club and they all gather to send their strongest fighters into battle and bet on the winner.  \n\nEdit: Pics of Kuma  and Jack [here] (https://imgur.com/gallery/X9kx2) \n\nEdit 2: Structure and spelling    ",

    "body": "I've seen the dog man too!!! Holy shit. I came in this thread to talk about it, and here is the perfect place to stick it.\n\nI was also camping in Michigan's upper peninsula, at JW Wells state park. It was late, around midnight. Us kids were in a giant tent, there were nine of us. Adults out drinking at the campfire. Suddenly, there are headlights shining into our camp- a ranger pulled up and rushed over to speak to the adults in whispered, frantic tones.\n\nNot two minutes later, our parents were scrabbling to get us out of the tent. We all piled into the van, scared...my mom explains that there are a family of wolverines in the campground that are aggravated over something, so the rangers want everyone in vehicles. \n\nWe are giggling and screwing around in the van for an hour when we hear this bone chilling, cackle like scream. It was LOUD. We all shut right up and are staring at each other, and I'm wondering if a wolverine really makes that sound when\n\nOur tent we were just in was ripped apart, we watched as something collapsed it and was thrashing around for what seemed like ever. All we had was the light of the campfire, myself and my two cousins staring HARD into the darkness behind the van, trying to make out this wolverine tearing up our canvas tent. It went still, and my dad and drunk uncle ran to the tent remains, beating it with sticks. They didn't find anything. No animal, no nothing.\n\nThe scream came again as they were kicking through the remains, from the woods behind the van. My uncle pointed his giant craftsman flashlight immediately in that direction, and SOMETHING FURRY STANDING ON TWO LEGS took off running, howling and screaming and cackling as it went, hooking its weird angled arms above its head. I saw the flashlight shine in its eyes, and that was no fucking bear. \n\nWe slept in our cars and left as soon as the sun was up. We left the shredded canvas tent behind, and my mom snapped a picture. I'll ask her for it next time I talk to her, if anyone is interested. The ranger refunded our week plus the night we stayed, and gave us a truck bed full of firewood. I think the adults knew it wasn't wolverines.\n\nEdit: way more interest than I realized, thanks everyone. I guess it could've been a mountain cat, like maybe a big bobcat, but the angles of the arms were opposite. I asked my mom for the photo, she said she'd dig through her pictures to see if she kept it. I hope she has! I'll update when I find out.\n\nEdit 2: my mother literally has two hundred boxes of photos. It's taking a while, but I'm going through them guys, and we'll find it. \n\nBonus though, my drunk uncle also took pictures that night, and he's looking too. He says he has the \"animal thing\" in a picture, I'lL GET THEM I SWEAR\n\nUpdate: 6/7/17 3:15p est\n\nMy mom says she's find the camping photos, she actually put them in her scrapbook. My drunk uncle is in south Carolina, I'm sure he'll get in contact if he does find them. Sorry for lame update guys,  I'm going to my mom's Friday for her birthday, and I'll get a picture of the scrapbook page. \n\nEdit 6/10:  hi guys, we partied pretty hard last night, and are going through photos today. Next update will definitely have photos!!! \n\nEdit 6/13/17: So I'm a lame OP. I cannot find the camping scrapbook. She thinks it's up in her garage attic, and there are thousands of pictures. My uncle hasn't gotten back a hold me yet either. We are still looking but I work sixty hours a week.. I promise this is on the top of my mind guys, I was actually contacted to talk about it for a podcast, which I will gladly do. I WILL keep updating this.\n\nEdit 8/17/17: We've torn the house apart to no avail. My uncle doesn't have his either. I'm sorry for everyone who woke up remind me bot, if I ever do come across them I will tag everyone who asked for them here. ",

    "body": "Once in high school we went on a trip by doubledecker bus and briefly got stuck in traffic. A few minutes in someone shouted to look to the left, where two lanes over a truck driver was visibly fapping away. He probably wasn't used to people being able to see into his truck while on the road because it took him painfully long to become aware that the whole top level of a bus full of teens was waving at him. Luckily for him our ways parted fairly soon after that, but the dread in his eyes upon realising we could see him leads me to believe he'll have flashbacks to this moment for the rest of his life.",

I had used shamanic drumming before to discover certain things, and I decided to do it again, but with a 'little help'. I had a large shrub of Brugsmansia sanguinea I had grown from a cutting. I made a tea, and not knowing a proper dosage, guessed at 2 leaves and two reddish orange flowers. I went to bed, and tried to do some drumming. After a while, I felt the drug coming on, quite strong, but for some reason, I fought it. I fell asleep. I had terrifying dreams of being chased by a demon who kept smashing my face into the projectors in a movie-theatre projection booth where I worked. I woke up at one point, from pain, as I ran into the kitchen counter at full speed, which smacked me down, and I crashed on my back on the hard floor, no hands to cushion me whatever. I gasped from the shock and pain and 'passed out' again. That's all I remember.\nWhen I awoke the next morning, I felt very strange. There was blood on the sheets, my legs were cut up, some nasty cuts on my forehead. My son stood at the foot of the bed, staring at me. He looked at me strangely and said, 'Dad, I think you need to come into the living room.' I followed him and stared aghast at the carnage. A large plate glass window, about 4 feet by 8 feet, had been smashed - it was not safety glass, there were ominous daggers of glass. It seems I had gone through it, fortunately knees first, or I would have been decapitated. I had torn the back door off its hinges, same thing with the clothes dryer. 'What happened?' I asked him.\nHe said I went crazy during the night, they didn't know why. The three kids cowered in their room as I ran back and forth through the house, smashing full speed into walls (evidently at the same time as my dreams of being chased by the demon). I was yelling and saying strange things. I stood in the shower with my clothes on and wept. I seemed intent on destroying myself, and did the aforementioned damage to the window and door.\n \nI went to check myself in the mirror. I looked like a Martian - my blue-green eyes were completely black, like those guys infected by the alien virus in the 'X-Files'. And I was cut up very badly.\n \nDO NOT TRY THIS STUFF!!! maybe under controlled circumstances with an experienced shaman it would be a different experience, but I could have been killed, and it was truly the most frightening experience of my life.\"\n\nFrom Wikipedia: The hallucinogenic effects of Brugmansia were described in the journal Pathology as \"terrifying rather than pleasurable\".\none example reported in Psychiatry and Clinical Neuroscience of a young man who amputated his own penis and tongue after drinking only 1 cup of Brugmansia tea.\nThe concentrations of alkaloids in all parts of the plant differ markedly. They even vary with the seasons and the level of hydration, so it is nearly impossible to determine a safe level of alkaloid exposure.",

    "body": "Sure... here's the full story in detail.  Again, I've questioned myself if my mind made this up or if it really happened... either way, it's a very comforting story to me and the way mom would want to be remembered.\n\nMom had a rare genetic cancer, and her last few months we had run out of options so it was more a challenge of making sure she was comfortable than hope for a cure.  So her final trip to the hospital, she decided it was time for hospice care.  Rode in the ambulance with her from the hospital to home, where the hospice nurses (who are incredible and I can't imagine how they do their job, it seems so difficult) were setting up the living room with her bed so she could spend her remaining time looking out on the yard and her garden.\n\nOne thing that still gives me chills and stress when I think about it was that the paramedics were pulling her out of the ambulance at the house, and one said to the other \"don't go so fast, I almost dropped her.\"  Just thinking about it now over 10 years later I still get queasy with the thought they almost dropped her onto the driveway.  (They didn't.)\n\nWe rolled her into the house, and some of my aunts and uncles were here and cousins, helping get things set up as well.  My one uncle had a stroke a few years before and was sitting in the dining room.  Mom still was getting over the chemo and needed to throw up right there.  At this point I was so used to it I would let her throw up in my hands.  My uncle wasn't... my mom's last words were \"your uncle doesn't look well, better get him a bucket.\"  (Mom's cancer was in her adenoids, she had all kinds of digestion and speech problems because of it.)\n\nSo we got her settled into the bed, everyone went home, and I unpacked my bag in my bedroom, probably 9PM.  Plan was I'd stay the first week, then a sibling would come and take over another week, and we'd trade off and make sure mom was as well as possible until the end.  We all knew it was a matter of days or hours, not weeks.\n\nA few times in the middle of the night, my dad would wake me up to help give mom some pain medication (morphine?).  Again, at this point it wasn't something I was uncomfortable doing and the hospice nurses had gone over everything.  Around 2am it was a little rough and not knowing what else to do, I called the hospice nurse.  She picked up on the first ring and said \"I've been waiting for you to call.\"  Said she would stop in first thing, but not to worry about \"every 6 hours\" -- just give mom the pain medication whenever she looked like it would be needed.  (Dad still was sure we shouldn't go overboard on it still.)\n\nFast forward to the morning.  I was sitting at the computer doing some work, right next to mom's bed.  Every few minutes I could see something out of the corner of my eye.  A dog?  Two dogs?  Is that a cat?  Just sitting next to Mom, nothing strange.  Except they hadn't had a dog for 10 years at that point, and a cat maybe 5.  (We had amazing pets, definitely part of the family.)\n\nThings like that went on throughout the morning.  Just thinking I was seeing things.  Mom was mostly comfortable throughout the day.\n\nAbout 1:45PM things started going south again.  I took a chair and put it at the foot of the bed, so she could see me if she had her eyes open.  Dad was standing to her one side holding her hand.  My aunt sat on the other side crying (because no one was paying attention to her -- I've still never forgiven her for that).  And my dad's weird super-religious cousin was behind the bed yelling about Jesus and praying... as if her prayers would finally reverse decades of cancer and treatements and such.\n\nSo I was sitting at the foot of the bed... about 1:52ish I saw a beam of light come through the window behind my aunt (dad's sister) and the little poof of white that could have been hair... and just felt... warm and happy.  My grandmother (dad's mother) could have been a stand in for Sophia on Golden Girls, and the size of the sun and glare was exactly her height.  It just felt... warm and super-comfortable.\n\nThen, around 1:58 or so, I heard a man's voice behind me.  \"We're here to get you.\"  I didn't recognize the voice.  My mom's father died the year before she and dad got married.  Then my mom's voice behind me saying how terrible she looked.  And the woman's voice -- that sounded like my mom's mother (who died around 1987) saying \"it's time to go.\"  I glanced back and another beam of light was coming through the window, but I swear I saw shapes that could be people moving.\n\nI also felt the same warm comforting feeling I did when the sunlight came in behind my crying aunt.  A lot more powerful at that point too.  Then I distinctly heard my mother's voice behind me saying \"Let's go\" and the light faded a bit.  \n\nI turned around to look at mom one last time.  She sat up in her bed (her eyes were closed) and when she was in more of a sitting pose than lying, her lips went from pale pink to blue.  She rested back into the bed and was gone.  I looked at the clock and it was 2:06 PM.",

    "body": "It did for me. My mom died of ALS and I spent the last few years of her life caring for her. ALS also affects speech so she would often just say \"help\" if she needed something if she didn't have the energy.  One day me and my sister were sitting with her probably about a week before she passed and she said, \"Help, help!\" We asked her what she needed and she said, \"I'm scared.\"  It was probably the most heartbreaking moment of my life because the only thing I wanted to do was make her not scared and it was the only thing I couldn't do.\n\nThis is probably the thing that upset me the most about the whole thing is that she had to die scared and there was nothing anyone could do. When they said she was changing by the hour (meaning she only had hours left.) I came over with my kitty that had slept with her every night while I had lived there because I knew she loved it when the cat slept with her. I felt like it was the only thing I could do do bring her some measure of reassurance. My kitty of course, seemed to know we needed her and behaved like a champ, laying with my mom to the very last breath.\n\nI've never been a religious person and neither has my family, and I think sometimes it makes things like this harder because I don't have the comfort of believing my mom went somewhere better with that confidence.  This makes me hope that maybe my dad who passed when I was 13 was there to help her through and tell her not to be scared.  I hope she wasn't.\n\nEdit: thank you for your warm wishes and assurances that I was of comfort to my mom. The cat in question has also been with me all morning offering her support. And I agree, fuck ALS and I'm so sorry to anyone who has had or currently has friends or family with ALS. I love that I can come here and people can share their experiences and everyone can feel just a little bit better.",

I know it was scary and I know cancer sucks but he is so okay and I just miss him.\n\nI used to get really strong dreams about him whenever I was having a really difficult time or something bad in my life was happening. The dreams would be different in details but basically he would come and say he loved me and that he wasn't angry at me and how much he just loves me. A few months ago i had a strong sense of him and just kinda... told him that although I miss him he doesn't have to stay around for me. That it's okay to just go and I'll be okay. \n\nThis is all really rambling, and I'm crying my eyes out but I'm also smiling really wide. Thank you for sharing your story.
