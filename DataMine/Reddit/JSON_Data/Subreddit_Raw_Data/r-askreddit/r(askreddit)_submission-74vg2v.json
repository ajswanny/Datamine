I student taught her Japanese class because a friend had done it for my class, and it was fun and a great experience for me. We bonded hard, and ended up dating. It only lasted a few months, but we stayed good friends, realized we were just better friends\n\n\nWe went every year together to the annual Cherry Blossom festival in D.C., and we always caught up. That trip, just for 3 days out of the year, was like a little time bubble - nothing back home mattered, none of the drama, the troubles, stresses that a high schooler could or would have, all of it washed away, and we got to spend 3 heavenly days together.\n\nThe first time we went together was when the marriage pact was made. At first, it was at 25. We settled on it, then a week later renegotiated to 30. Every year we reminded each other; every year made it more real for me, and something awesome to look forward to while simultaneously knowing we could still do what we wanted to before then. \n\nI graduated. We fell apart a bit. She went downhill a bit, pills and drinking, until she got pregnant at 18; I drank heavily and slept my way around trying to fix my crippling depression. I remember hearing about it. It didn't shatter my dreams of marrying her - if she was single at 30, kids or no, I was putting a ring on it. It never bothered me.\n\nKid 2 came a few years later. A few years after that, we bumped into each other and caught up. It was like no time had passed, and we done right back into our old friendship, incorporating all the things that has happened over the years. She was 24, I was 25. We spent the next two years trying to put a relationship together before the pact was due; it worked between us, but what didn't work was that we both has establishes, busy lives apart. I worked 50-60 a week, she was a full time mom and social services worker. We tried, we really did. But it always came down to \"Work needs me another night this week\", \"The kids are sick so I'm on full nurse duty.\" I loved her more than anything. \n\nShe died two months ago this coming week. We never got to carry through with our pact, but we'd gotten so close. My buddy moved up after a divorce; she was getting over a bad injury during her time in the military; time was again working against us. Then she was just gone. Blood clot from her lungs to her heart. And so it goes.\n\nI would have carried out the pact; I would have married her anytime between the past few years and 30. But I didn't. I beat myself up a bit for it, even if I had just had a few years to call her my wife. She'll always be in my heart, and that voice in my head that stops me from treating myself poorly. She has become my voice of reason, and maybe that makes me a little crazy, but it keeps her close to me, knowing full well I'll never smell her hair again or feel her hand on my face. \n\nShe was my Sunshine, and I was her Buoy. That'll never leave me. Maybe this wasn't the place for this post, but here it is.\n\nEdit: I just wanted to broadscope thank everyone who commented below; your kindness has found a wanting home in me, and I thank you all for it. I have made positive steps towards integrating her and our memories into my everyday step, but there are days where it is still hard. Thank you again.",

    "body": "My husband and I met online, playing a MUD (online text based roleplaying game for the normies out there) when I was 12 and he was 13. He lived in eastern Canada and I lived in the Western US. We flirted a little and internet \"dated\" off and on every few years, but for the most part we were just internet friends who could always find something to talk about. We jokingly made the exact pact to marry if we weren't already by 30. No matter what, we always kept in contact. \n\nSo when I was around 20, I got into a bad relationship, and ended up having an unplanned pregnancy. During this time we lost contact for about a year. I think we might have talked 4 or 5 times within that year for a few minutes a piece. The father and I broke up before I even had the baby, and after I gave birth and was recovering at home, I hopped on the computer and opened up my old messenger. \n\nHe was online, and we talked. A little at first. Then some more. This worked up to hours a day, updates on everything we were doing and confusing in each other our despairs and triumphs. We became best internet friends again.\n\nWhen my son was about a year and a half old, I suggested that he come and visit me. We were both working, he had vacation saved up, why not? But he resisted me. I couldn't figure out why, and I would later learn he was staying away as a precaution because he thought maybe I just wanted someone to take care of me, and didn't want to take a chance of being used.\n\nSo a couple more years passed. We were still best friends. I didn't push him to visit me again, and one day he got his tax return back and suggested it to me this time. At that moment a whole world opened up to us. We really, really loved each other as friends, but had never really thought being together was a true, real life thing we could do. We got giddy over it. We promised we wouldn't say \"I love you\" until after we'd spent a total of one year in person with each other.\n\nWell, we met and had explosive chemistry. We'd really been together in spirit, more or less since we were 12. We said I Love You the end of the first visit. That was 2 years ago, and we're celebrating 1 year married this November.\n\nHe's my person, and I'm his. I'm happy every day he's with me, and leaving after our visits made me never take his presence for granted. I'm at work but I'm happy every day to come home to my son and my husband. They are my life.\n",

    "body": "Kinda! \n\nSo I dated this girl 10 years ago, in high school, in Australia. She was my first, I thought I was going to marry her (young and dumb, but maybe onto something?) and then she dumped me; she considers it a dumb decision now, but it needed to happen that way. I just joke about it :)\n\nWe didn't talk for 8 years.\n\nWhile I was on exchange in London earlier this year, I visited Barcelona. I knew she lived there at the time, so I messaged her for advice on where to go. It was the first time I'd felt comfortable messaging her.\n\nShe had flown to Australia the day before, but offered me advice. We also started catching up, and ended up messaging nonstop everyday since.\n\nTurns out, while I was walking around Barcelona, I mega fluked taking a [photo](https://imgur.com/a/HsH0e) of her apartment, which she told me weeks later when I uploaded the pic. I just liked the paint job on the building. Out of all the streets, in all the cities in the world, one of 20 photos I took of buildings was hers... I still can't believe it.\n\nWhen I got home from studying, we caught up. Kissed within 3 hours and slept together within 4. Then it just grew from there. The entire time I was saying \"This is literally as best it can go for two Ex's\", as we went from Ex's, to friends, to potentials, to dating.\n\nWe also realised that in in our 2002 primary school photo, from when I was 10*, I was standing directly behind her. I liked her then when I was 8, but only spoke to her when I was 15.\nAlso realised we lived within 100m of each other for years, during the time we didn't speak.\nMy Dad also works with her housemate, and is 'the crazy dude' from work.\n\nLike a moron, I had organised a second semester abroad before we started dating. We kinda decided it as I left the country. Now I have 4 months of purgatory in Canada, while I wait to meet up with her in Barcelona...\n\nIn true wild style, I asked her to marry me, because trust me, it's just something I know. She said yes, but I need to ask in person. I bought the [engagement ring](https://imgur.com/a/pp0bs) last week, on my 25th birthday, and now I just have to look at it for another 3 months.\n\nSo not a pact, as such, but a literal rom-com irl. I study film, and could very easily make this a script. Maybe one day \ud83d\ude0a\n\n*Update*\n\nI just got out of Bladerunner 2049 (Go see it!!! One of the best movies I've seen in recent years) and this has blown up!!! I think this is easily my top comment ever. Crazy.\n\nI don't have any data right now, due to Canada's crazy prices, so I'm itching to get home and reply to everyone.\n\nI'll upload a photo of the ring and the photo I took of her apartment with a photo she took months before from inside.\n\nShe's also out of reception down the coast in Aus, but I can't wait to show her this thread!\n\n*Edit*\n\n*#1* Was 10, not 8. I guessed instead of doing the math \ud83d\ude1e\n\n*Proof*\n\n*#1*: [Photo](https://imgur.com/a/HsH0e) of her apartment in Barcelona.\n\n*#2*: [Photo](https://imgur.com/a/pp0bs) of her ring. Don't click on this, Babe! :/ :D <3",

So here are some additional details (some is cut and paste from my comments to others). \n\nHe and I were best friends from age 15-20. Somewhere between that age is when we made the pact. Age 20 (but before he met the wife, he tells me he would divorce if he happened to be married at age 30 and if I was still not married. A week after this convo, he tells me how he really feels about me and I decline. A month after this, he brings the girl into my workplace, introduces her to me (he only just met her after he told me how he felt about me which is why I didn't know who she was), and shows me the ring to explain that they are engaged. They get married and it was the same wife he wanted to leave for me when I heard from him again 10 years later.\n\nYes they did have 2 children and yes he is (or was) unhappy in his marriage.

    "body": "I can't not bring up this story from the last time I saw this question (not mine, but the original was [deleted](https://www.reddit.com/r/defaultgems/comments/4rah8f/ualexclifford_shares_the_tragic_story_of_his/)): \n\n-------\n\nProbably too late for this not to get buried, but I have a story about this. We met in college, and were instant best friends. I was 20; she was 18. We spent all our time together, and were briefly lovers, but we never formally dated because both of us were very much into being wild and free and enjoying our youth. We dated other people on and off, but we talked about it and agreed that a committed relationship between the two of us would be an all-or-nothing kind of thing. Since neither of us wanted to give up our hedonistic, promiscuous, irresponsible lifestyle, we made a point of not committing to a relationship. A few years went by that way, and we were very happy, right up until her sisters died.\n\nIt was a car accident. They were 16 and 18, and both were killed in the crash. Dead on arrival at the hospital. My friend was utterly, completely devastated. It still hurts me to remember it, even now. Her father, though, was even more devastated, to the point where he was legitimately willing to let himself starve to death rather than try to go on living. She moved home, out of state, to take care of him. She cut ties with everyone for awhile, even me. I didn't see her again for two years. She was so different after that. Before the accident, she'd always been the most joyful, exuberant, positive person I'd ever met. After she came back, she was quieter, sadder, maybe wiser. I wanted to be there for her more than I'd ever wanted anything in the world. Not being able to fix things for her, not being able to make it better, that hurt more than anything I could ever remember. I guess that's when I realized how in love with her I was.\n\nI told her that I loved her, that I wanted to be there with her, and she told me that she couldn't handle the idea of any kind of emotional connection for awhile. Maybe a few years, she said. Maybe never. Maybe she'd never be able to open up emotionally again. She said she needed space from me, particularly from me. She said she needed to figure out what it meant to be alive in a world where her sisters were gone. She asked me to give her time, and I told her that I'd give her anything she wanted. She told me that she'd never been happier than she was when we were together. I told her the same. I told her that I understood, and that's when we made our pact. I was 25 then, and she was 23. We agreed: if she turned 30 and I turned 32, and if she had learned to heal, and if she hadn't fallen in love with someone else, and if I hadn't fallen in love with someone else, then we'd get married. So that's how we parted ways. She moved to Wyoming, to be alone. I moved to Germany, to get as far away from her as I could. We didn't keep in touch at first, but over the next few years we built up a correspondence. We wrote letters because we both liked writing letters. We emailed now and then. Sometimes we'd mail each other books that we thought the other would like. Years went on, and we became closer and closer. When I turned 30, I half-jokingly brought up our marriage pact. I told her that I hadn't ever fallen for anyone else. (I didn't mention this, but I couldn't have fallen for anyone else. I always compared every other woman to her, and in my memory she was perfect.) She replied that she was still very serious about our agreement, and that she'd never fallen in love with anyone else either. I asked her if she thought she had begun to heal, and she said she had, as much as a person could ever heal from something like that. A year later, she told me she'd like us to meet and spend some time together, to see if the spark was still there.\nIt was. She was living in California at that time, and I found a job there. I'd always wanted to live in California anyway. I proposed to her six months later, and she smiled and told me \"no fair\", that I had to wait another few months, when she'd be turning 30. I thought it was silly, but at that point things were going so well that a few months didn't seem like they could matter at all. But I'm crying now, so I'll have to wrap this up quickly.\n\nShe died. That's how the story ends. She was hit by a drunk driver and spent 2 days in the ICU before her body gave out. I went to her funeral. I spoke to her father but I barely remember what we said. I've never spoken to him since. I don't have the willpower to make myself find out how he's doing. That will be four years ago this November. I'm in therapy and trying to learn how to have feelings again, other than blank, mindless, miserable rage. I often wonder if this is what it felt like for her. She made progress. She learned to feel again. That thought is what keeps me going. She did it. She'd want me to do it.\n\nThat's it. That's the story. It's a shitty story, and I hate it.\n\nEDIT: This is very difficult for me, in that I didn't expect to go back and re-read this, but all the replies dinging on my phone were too much to ignore. It's hard to explain what it's like to only have two emotional states - anger and nothing. Someone said this reminded them of a Nicholas Sparks story and...\n\nHere's the difference between life and a love story: in a book, she'd have regained consciousness before she died. In a movie, she'd have opened her eyes and looked at me one last time. I wouldn't have had to see her all smashed up with tubes in her throat. I'd have had a chance to tell her how much I loved her instead of the last words I said to her being, \"Don't forget to pick up Scout's flea medicine.\" I'd be noble and tragic now, instead of a miserable shell of a person just trying and failing to believe that anything could ever be worth anything ever again.\n\nI'm sorry. I'm so angry. I want to delete this post but my therapist would tell me that this is progress, somehow.\nThank you all for your kind words. If I have any advice to give, it's to go hold the people you love while there's still time. I have to go take some medicine now. Please have a very nice night. Thank you again for being kind.\n\n------\n\nI want to reiterate that this isn't my story.   Just one that stands out heavily in my memory that I thought people here might enjoy. \n\nedit: the original author, /u/AlexClifford, replied below!  ",

I was like 3 when our church got new pastors(a husband and wife team) and they had a 1 year old daughter. I grew up being told by my parents that the first thing I said when I saw her was \u201c I\u2019m going to marry her\u201d. We grew up together and were very good friends. There was the 2 or 3 year age difference so she had friends more in her range and I me but when we were together we were pretty inseparable. For some reason I always kinda thought we were meant to be together. I guess I took that \u201cI\u2019m gonna marry her\u201d to heart. So even after she moved away and I had very little contact with her I still kinda kept her in the back of my mind. Whenever I wallowed in self pity and thought I was going to die alone I always told myself at least there\u2019s *pastor\u2019s daughter*. I always thought of showing up wherever she was and sweeping her of her feet. Like she was just waiting for me or something. I feel horrible for thinking that now.  \n\nAnd now we\u2019re happily married. Just not to each other. I have my wife and she has her own. \n\nWe reconnected right after Facebook became a thing and it was very obvious she\u2019s a lesbian. That was what finally got me off my ass and got the courage to meet someone. I no longer kept the idea of marrying her on a back burner. I\u2019m very happy with my family and she is with hers.

They have a kid, she ends up meeting some dude in a chat room and runs off to Pennsylvania, leaves the kid.\n\nHe fucks some Craigslist prostitutes (this was circa 2007, before tinder), they get back together but not happily, he even said to me at one point, \"I know she's bored but I want the marriage to work. I don't care of you fuck her, I know she's gonna do it and I'd rather it was with someone I know and trust.\" She leaves again.\n\nThen he gets busted as part of a big child porn sharing ring. That was the end of the friendship pretty much. Not over the porn but he just wasn't able to admit he had a problem. Call me crazy, but being a sick fuck in denial is very different from being a sick fuck and owning up to it. She got custody and remarried.\n\n",

Long story short, they broke apart for 10 years, started talking when they were around 28 or 29, got together and were all set to get married, as they both had never found another person. \n\nThen she was hit by a drunk driver, two months before the wedding. After all that time of not being together and thinking of her, her life was ripped from his hands. The guy was in a mental hospital for some time after that. That's all I vaguely remember from the post.\n\nEdit: found it. https://imgur.com/FVYjEzV",

A small little corner in the library felt like some sort of ghetto LAN party or something rather; anyways I remember meeting the sister and we started talking and playing together.

He's well off enough that he can probably afford to take a year or so off work, but it's not sustainable. I don't know if he's going to make it. A year ago I would have said that I didn't know if *I* was going to make it, but lately I think maybe I'm going to get through this. I hope he does too. I feel like I should try to help him, but I'm scared that it would be like trying to save a drowning man: if you aren't a professional, you might end up drowning along with him.\n\nThanks very much to everyone who has been kind.

    "body": "This is a shitty feeling! In the early days of AOL, my twelve year old self made \"friends\" with a thirteen year old boy from England. We shared everything, sent holiday cards, playlists, secrets, etc. We hit a lot of big milestones around the same times like first significant others, first kiss, losing our respective virginity... We fade in and out of touch as adults and reconnected. Both of us just out of shitty relationships and we decide it's high time we meet. We both figured maybe WE'RE the reason nothing worked out for us - because we were meant to be together. Right? Anyway. He looks at plane tickets, I request time off of work. Then a week before his flight, he cancels because he met someone. They fell in \"love\". Eventually got married and had two kids annnnnd just got divorced.   Meanwhile, I moved back home, fell out of touch again, I met someone (not just anyone... Thanks, eHarmony!), fell pregnant, had a beautiful baby, and going on one and a half years of happy marriage. \n\nI still wonder what would've happened had he made good on his promise... ",

Leisure Suit Larry was a naughty game and my parents had no idea we had found it on some shareware. AIM ICQ and actual chat rooms like Open24 came about when I was hitting the teenage years and I quickly discovered how many perverts are interested in young girls lol ew.  But I made a few friends that kept in touch for several years. I dabbled in learning html to make my own sparkly geocities web page and then web page wizards came around and I forgot most of that stuff. It was an awesome new world and I was lucky to have parents that really embraced new technology at that time. It's cool seeing the leaps and bounds made every year.  ",

Sullivan\u00a0to describe the inclination to skew\u00a0perceptions\u00a0of others based on\u00a0fantasy. The \"distortion\" is a faulty perception of others, based not on actual experience with the other individual, but on a projected fantasy\u00a0personality\u00a0attributed to the individual. For example, when one falls in love, an image of another person as the \u201cperfect match\u201d or \u201csoul mate\u201d can be created when in reality, the other person may not live up to these expectations or embody the imagined traits at all.\n\nEdit: A couple people have PM'ed me - I am not a psychiatrist by any means, and self diagnosis is a not a good idea (I am absolutely able to listen nonetheless). Please always speak to medical professionals if you think you may be suffering/have experienced something like parataxic distortion. ",

He's over weight,  no girl prospects, stuck driving the truck because he's too large for anything else.  We've chatted for almost 2 years in a big brother/little sister capacity. I'm giving valuable life advice from my wealth of knowledge at 16 years old lol.  He appreciates having someone to talk to.  \n\nI have an art club trip to Chicago coming up and he decides to drive from Pennsylvania with a buddy to come meet me. MY PARENTS ACTUALLY OK THIS,  as they've chatted with him on the phone a few times.  \n\nSo we meet in his hotel room and hang out and chat,  and amazingly I don't end up on the side of a milk carton. He's everything he said he was and we have a great time just being buds. \n\nUnfortunately I'm late getting back to the bus and my roommate rats me out because the chaperones are getting nervous.  They come get me and I'm on lock down for the rest of the trip and have to sleep in the chaperones room. \n\nWhen I get back to school,  I get called to the principal's office and get to discuss my screw up.  Because there are no rules on the books, I avoid punishment.  The principal informs me that I am the reason that rule will most certainly be added to the book.  \n\nAnd that is the only mark I ever left on that high school.  The guy and I were friends for about 7 years total before losing touch. I found him on FB once and he's lost weight and found a wife, but didn't accept my friend request,  but I'm happy he's found a good life.
