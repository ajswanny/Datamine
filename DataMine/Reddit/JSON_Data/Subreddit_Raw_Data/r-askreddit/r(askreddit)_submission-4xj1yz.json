I then get in my car and rev my engine up for about a minute to \"warm up the engine because my car has a turbo on it and a youtube video said I should because reasons\" and also because at about 3000rpms my aftermarket exhaust resonates in just this certain way that I like. Since I live in an apartment complex, I park facing someone else's bedroom window, so I make sure that my headlights are on, because I like the way their curtains look in my HID headlights. They are the curtains with holes in them that dont block out much light, so I'm sure they enjoy the way their room becomes illuminated with a pattern. Then, since i drive a stick, I try to shift into reverse, gun it to chirp my tires (helps them warm up), forget about reverse lockout so I'm actually in first, drive forward as fast as possible on accident, and crash into my neighbors bedroom. Then I get out because I forgot to grab the coffee cup I put on top of my car, back up, and go to my job at Comcast Customer Service. ",

I went outside to see what the hell was going on, along with about half my neighbors too.  The source was a Mustang parked in a spot in between buildings, but no one wanted to be the guy who approached the car (this was in Florida so it was 50/50 that angrily banging on the window would have ended with a gun in your face).  We decided to call the cops instead and somehow it fell on me to make the call, which meant I had to wait up for the cop to come to my door and talk to me.  When the cop showed up he told me it was some kid taking his date home.  He claimed he was resting his foot on the accelerator and didn't realize how loud it was, which is one of the biggest loads of bullshit I've ever heard.  In fact the next day (at around four in the afternoon) I tried resting my foot on the accelerator to see how much noise it made.  The engine barely got up to 2000 RPM.  I'm pretty sure it was just his sad douche way of trying to impress a girl and I hope to hell my calling the cops ruined any chances he had with her.",

The engine should sound a little quiet and tired.\n\n2) Let engine warm up for 3-5 minutes. It should get louder, perhaps sound like it's about to take off for space flight.\n\n3) Tap the accelerator pedal once, it should go down to a normal level of engine running sounds.\n\n4) Drive.\n\nYou do not need to, nor should you rev the engine every 15 seconds because you're bored. Some areas require that you sit in or with your car as it warms up. If you're bored, catch a pokemon or watch a cat video on your phone.",

I actually tried to talk to them about this like fucking grownups. I wasn't even that much older than they were, maybe 2 or 3 years. I told them that I had to get up at 4:30 every morning, and I'd appreciate it if they actually adhered to the rules of the apartment complex and kept the noise down after 11pm. That still only gave me about 5.5 hours of good sleep, but I was trying to compromise. \n\nThey didn't listen. \n\nSo after about another week of this shit, I actually knocked on their door at 5:15am and re-introduced myself and said, \"This is what time I have to be up by so I can get to work. Do you feel how tired you are? That's how tired *I* am because you and your friends hung out on your patio, which is 15' from my bedroom window, til 1am last night. This is why I asked you to keep it down after 11pm, which is a full hour after the time the apartment complex requires you to keep it down on weeknights.\"\n\nI'm not normally that confrontational, but those kids pissed me off. I tried reasoning with them and when it didn't work I knew I'd have to *show* them what I meant. They were much better after that, but they moved out at the end of their lease a few months later.

Back porch one evening(home): she made the boys that were hanging out take all the patio furniture out for the trash men. In the morning, she woke us up and made us bring it all back in with no recollection of making everyone take it out. Plus various nights of sleep walking and over medicating. Oh and one black Friday, she decided to leave at like 6am for a sale somewhere and blew a tire on a curb, somehow made it home. Unbelievable. ",

    "body": "I remember dating a girl who was on Ambien. It made me feel like a rapist.\n\nOne night I was at the bar and I drunk texted her and said I was coming over, she said she just popped an Ambien but she would try to stay awake for me, but promised me good sex in the morning and a good breakfast regardless. When I got there it was like she was a woman possessed, like Sigourney Weaver in Ghostbusters type possessed. We had a pretty good sexual relationship at this point but that night she was a straight savage, she had vigor and freakiness that I had never seen in her before. She licked me in places that I had *never* been licked in before. She somehow knew different places to touch me to get me ready for a round two after a 5 minute break. This was the best sex of my life.\n\nThe next morning I get a text from family with a semi emergency situation where I had to leave right away. I kissed her head and said bye. She texted me later in the morning that she was sorry that she passed out on me last night and she would make it up. I just texted back I'm coming over immediately. I went into great detail of what happened the night before and went into different areas of the apartment that had evidence of *certain* activities. She just had this look of utter shock and disbelief because it was not only that she didn't remember anything, it was that apparently certain things she did that night, she never did before and never felt the urge to. \n\nIt was the weirdest feeling to me, on one hand it was great sex, but on the other hand it felt immoral since she had no memory of the scenario. I thought to myself what if that happened with a girl that I just met at a bar or something, who wasn't as comfortable with me as my girlfriend was, a no consent state of mind is technically rape.\n\n\ntl;dr Ambien turned my gf into sex goddess while she was blacked out on it.",

    "body": "You know after Home Improvement had finished it's amazing run, Richard Karn got a gig hosting Family Feud.  My friends and I were in LA, and went to the taping of the very first episode.\n\nRichard came out to warm up the crowd a little bit, and we could tell that he was a little nervous with it being the premiere episode, so I waited for an appropriate time when he made some funny quip, and I yelled, \"I don't think so, Tim!\"  \n\nHe laughed, and gave me a subtle point with the finger.  I think he appreciated a fan in the audience; but the audience itself all turned around and frowned at me like I was just yelling random shit.  One of them even said, \"His name isn't Tim.\"\n\nSuddenly *I* was the asshole.",

On February 1, 1994, the company filed its application with the following description: \"The mark consists of the exhaust sound of applicant's motorcycles, produced by V-twin, common crankpin motorcycle engines when the goods are in use.\" Nine of Harley-Davidson's competitors filed oppositions against the application, arguing that cruiser-style motorcycles of various brands use the same crankpin V-twin engine which produces the same sound.
