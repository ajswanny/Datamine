    "body": "My mom and her boyfriend abused me and my two younger siblings (brother and sister) when we were very young. I was the oldest, at age 5 at the time of my brother's first birthday, when I noticed something wasn't right. But at 5 I didn't really understand what was going on, and I thought abuse was normal. Until one day, a few days after my brother's birthday, she told me my brother was \"sick\" and that she he needed to go to the hospital. I didn't think much about it and said my goodbyes, as my mom dropped me off at my aunts house on the way to the hospital.\n\nI arrived at my aunt's house, she gave me a bath, and me and my cousins played and watched television until it turned dark. Then something went wrong. We heard a knock on the door. I heard, and started after the door, thinking my mom was here with my baby brother. I was thinking he was okay and everything was fine. My aunt opened the door, and started to cry. I tried to piece it all together before I realized there were two tall men at the door. Police officers. They picked me up and told me I had to go away. I remember screaming for my aunt and I didn't get to say goodbye. At the time I didn't understand what was happening at all. I even thought maybe they were picking me up and taking me to my mother.\n\nWe arrive at a place I cannot remember much about, where they fed me and took care of me that night until the sun came up. After I had woken up, it was off to another location. They were taking me to a foster home. I was living with a large family I didn't know, and it was all too scary for me. I stayed there for a few weeks until I was moved somewhere else. There I waited in a room when I saw somebody I knew. My grandparents and my sister. But my brother wasn't there. I began to worry that he was still sick. I got so excited still, and even more so learning that they were taking me home. That's when they began to explain to me where I was and why all of this had happened. All the abuse and neglect was too much for him. He wasn't sick. He was dying. And the reason why I was taken away was simply because, my mother (and her boyfriend) was charged for abusing us, and causing him to pass away.\n\nAll this didn't really phase me at the time, since I was still just a child. But after the years I started to blame myself for not being able to do anything about it, even though I was so young and couldn't possibly do so. Every year, on his birthday, I go to where he was buried and put a flower on his grave. My aunt told me he loved yellow, so I always make sure to get yellow flowers, and maybe a small toy I think he would've liked. And sometimes I wonder if he's up there, looking down on me, and likes the fact that I still visit him every year.",

She liked for the two of us to play in the doghouse in the backyard where she would try to get me to play a game that she said her dad played with her. The game involved touching each other in ways an adult should never touch a child. My mom thought it was weird that the girl always wanted to play in the doghouse with me and so got rid of the doghouse pretty quickly.\n\nI didn't understand what the game meant then and it took two decades for me to realise just what it meant. It was like lightning just stuck me one day and I suddenly remembered the incident and understood what it meant.\n\nThat little girl was abused by her dad and I can't even remember her name. I still haven't gotten the courage to ask my mom if she remembers the girl. I've never tried to find her. I have never told anybody and I'm ashamed of my cowardice.\n\nUPDATE: Thank you all for your support, kind words, and encouragement.

Before I found out( I found out by looking at her phone, she did not tell me) we were having arguments and just not getting along. One night I finally had enough and approached her to discuss what was happening to us. It was then that she told me that she didn't know if she loved me anymore. 2 weeks later I found sexual pictures of her sent to him, texts between him and her that discussed getting together to hook up, and the most hurtful things a wife could say about her husband. At this point I understood why she was feeling detached from me. All her emotional needs were being met by this other man. \n\nWe have 3 amazing kids. A son and 2 daughters. 10,9,7 respectively. They are such good kids. I am dumbfounded that my wife would do this. We have been together for 20 years and married for 14. I think back to when she loved me and we were so happy. Life has been challenging for us but not any different or difficult than most couples. I am so in love with her. She is an amazing mom, extremely beautiful to me, and has a very attractive bubbly personality that everyone loves. I am so proud that she is my wife. At least I was. \n\nFast forward to now, it roughly been 7-8 months, she has yet to show any remorse or show me any affection. Im so lonely, sad, afraid, and ashamed. I am very ashamed to say that I have thought about suicide. That way she would be rid of me and she could be happy. Of course that I could never do that to my kids. They would be so hurt and confused. At this point I pray that I will get a fatal disease or have a fatal accident. \n\nWe have been and still are going to Counseling. She did end the relationship with the other man the day after I found out. She did say she loves me but is not romantically in love with me. Her actions are just not showing me much. \n\nI haven't told a soul except the Counsellor. Close friends of mine always ask me what is wrong. My brothers and parents do the same. I don't want them to think that my wife is anything but a good wife and lover. \n\nPushing through. Hopefully this has a good ending. Thanks for reading. ",

    "body": "On the day of our 10 year wedding anniversary I found that my wife had been talking to a guy online, trading pics, talking about possibly leaving me for about a month and a half. I sort of knew the guy through the Guild my wife and  I were in (world of warcraft). The night before when I got home from work she was telling me some jokes he had told her and I found it strange that she found them as funny as she did. I felt like it wasn't something she would normally laugh at. So while we were on the couch watching TV, I logged into her discord account and the first thing I saw was \"I'd send you butt pics but I'm being supervised\". I immediately excused myself and went to bed, I didn't know what to think so I just shut down. Upon waking up in the morning I googled a script that would download thier chat history from discord and i read it all. My heart broke when I read \"I'm so angry at (husband) when he's not with me, but I'm fine when he's here\". My heart shattered the first time I saw her say \"I love you\" in the chat logs. It shattered again when I saw \"I thought banging (husband) a bunch would cure my horniness but it hasn't). I haven't cried in... Fuck I can't even remember the last time I cried but I cried 3 times while reading the logs. It was a sick train ride of deep sadness, despair, and anger seeing the progression of this happening. Getting further into the logs I see them arguing, resolving said arguments and then arguing again. At one point she exclaims to him she doesn't know why she's doing this and that she really loves me but he's like her kryptonite and she can't help it. I can see both of them pushing each other away, yet still trading pics (presumably through Snapchat although I can't prove it) every so often. By the end of the logs it appeared to me that they were basically masturbating buddies whenever one or the other got horny I guess. It seemed like any relationship had run it's course and they were just mechanically (or habitually?) doing this. \n\nI confronted her. Said \"happy anniversary.... Do we have another year?\" Told her I found the logs and read them. She explained how it happened, that we did have another year, she didn't know how to end it once she realized what she was doing, that she didn't REALLY cheat on me (*eyeroll*), that she would immediately block him on everything.... i was pretty catatonic for almost a week. It's about 6 weeks later now. We seem to be doing fine now I think. The trust is still broken though, and I still find myself wanting to log into all her accounts to check on things if she leaves her phone out or computer on. I am doing mostly ok at this point, though sometimes I'll hear or see something that reminds me of everything (like when I saw this post title) and I'll have... an attack of depression...? I guess. Hard to explain. I haven't talked to anyone about this because I still love her and I don't want my family and friends to hate her. \n\nNow, I feel like I should note why she was angry with me since I mentioned it but didn't really explain. She was angry because she felt like I wasn't doing anything/enough around the house. She talked to me about that (while she was already talking to him). Now, I felt like I was doing plenty and she just wasn't recognizing it. However, I still took her complaint seriously. So I started writing down EVERYTHING I did around the house in a sort of daily journal: from picking up trash, cleaning up cat puke, taking care of the 'lil one, to picking up her old coffee mugs and used Splenda packets. I'm still doing this, because I realized while I was doing things around the house before I started the documentation it was hard to say how much I was actually doing because most of it seems inconsequential by itself and I would forget what I had done making it hard to say I wasn't just being lazy. when tracking it though it's much easier to remember (without looking at the journal) and it all added together is actually alot that I do. Plus, it's just satisfying to see the pages fill up from margin to margin with all of that stuff. \n\nAnyways... Thanks for this post. It's been really good to actually say something about this. ",

    "body": "I own a 5 foot tall sex doll while living with 2 grandmas & my mom. It was interesting ordering the doll and getting this big box weighing 80 pounds into the house with no one noticing.(I sat outside waiting for UPS to arrive just so no door bell was rung.)  Had to go through the front door- through the hallway then into my room. Somehow I did it with no one seeing. After owning her for about a week it's a real bitch trying to keep her clean with people around - so strategizing clean up times in the bathroom sure is a chore. One time I had her in the bathtub to clean up and just took a shower so no one would question, then I open the bathroom door to see my grandma waiting to use it. I just had to pray she didn't open the shower curtains while doing her business- in which she didn't. So a few months go by, some family needs to move in. I would now share my room with my brother and his girlfriend temporarily.  I hide the doll in a big enough box, inside my closest. No one knows I have this life sized doll- and I would rather keep it that way.   ",

I wasn't always this way - it kind of happened over the past 6 or 7 years after a deep depression and struggle with drugs.  I've been happy and drug free for several years, but I haven't been the same.  When I make myself hang out with friends, I generally sit there thinking about how long I should stay before I can duck out and go home without looking like an asshole.  Its hard for me to have conversations with people because I just think things like \"When are they going to leave me alone?\", or \"When can I leave?\".  I'm pretty good at hiding it and have several people who consider me to be their friends, but I secretly get no enjoyment out of those relationships.\n\nI'm not sure why my fiancee is different, but it makes me very afraid of losing her.  I'm almost positive I won't find anyone else that I will be able to love like I do her.

    "body": "I have stage four stomach cancer.\n\nOver a two month period earlier this year, I unexpectedly dropped about 30 lbs of weight from 220 lbs to 190.  I was urged by friends and family to seek medical help, so I did.  I was diagnosed with gastritis.  After failure to successfully treat it, they realised there was a misdiagnosis.  I've been misdiagnosed since then with crowns disease, diverticulitis, and ulcerative colitis over a few months.  Last thursday, I received the diagnosis of stage four gastric cancer.\n\nFinally, one of the doctor's I've been seeing decided to do an endoscopy, where they run a tube with a camera down into your organs to get a better look.  They found a tumorous growth inside of my stomach.  It proves to be malignant.  Theyve found that it has spread to nearby lymphnodes and I have an appointment tomorrow for them to check other organs they now believe may have also been affected.  I do not know how to tell my family about this.  \n\nMy symptoms have been persistent nausea, blood in vomit and stool, disinterest in food and even when hungry I feel full after a couple bites, I've continued to lose weight and am now down to about 175 (I haven't weighed 175 since middle school.)  I'm constantly fatigued, which sucks working 60hrs a week doing physical work.  Fairly constant discomfort in my abdomen as well.  I've been diligent in hiding all of this from my wofe, kids, parents, siblings, coworkers, and friends.  I never told them much after the diagnosis of Crohn's disease and diverticulitis.  I do not want anyone to treat me differently or try to do things for me that I can still do.  I just want to stay useful for as long as I can.  I don't want to burden anyone with such news, and I'd like to keep my dignity for the time being.\n\nAfter a lifetime of bipolar disorder I have never liked myself or wanted to stay alive.  I had a successful suicide attempt 12 years ago but was revived shortly after by emergency medical services.  Three years later I tried again and failed.  Less than a year later I was baker acted for starting to set forth a plan to kill myself.  I have always hated myself and thought of suicide.   I've also always been an atheist so I do not fear an afterlife of torment and despair.  But this diagnosis almost makes me want to believe in a god.  I know I will not live, and there is nothing I can do about it, not anyone else.  I don't have to give my family a bigger grief of suicide now, I can just let this cancer take me.  And take me it will.  \n\nThis is my secret, and I will keep it from everyone but you, Reddit.   As nobody in my personal life uses this site, I can rest assured you will keep it too. It does feel much better to get that off my chest, I appreciate those who took the time to read it.",

    "body": "A few years ago I went camping with one of my best friends. \n\nDuring the 3 day camp out in the Poconos we only brought meats. We had 0 vegetables. It was basically a 3 day BBQ for 2. \n\nOn our last night there I awake around 3am to the most FOUL grumble and pain in my stomach as I realize I have to shit NOW. \n\nI look around for a good place within our little clearing, but there was none where I could comfortably squat. Until I notice his truck we came to the campsite in. \n\nI ran over to the truck and leaned my back on the panel right over the rear wheel well and FUCKING EXPLODE. It HAD to look like that scene in [South Park where Cartman made his mom bring the pan for him to shit in](https://media.giphy.com/media/sO5eDV8ZBXERO/giphy.gif). \n\nI wiped off, and went back to bed... Relieved. \n\nI wake up in the morning to my friend shaking me. \n\n\"Etsu. Bro. Did you shit all over my truck?\" \n\nNow I could have said yes and we would have laughed our asses off. I'm not shy about it or anything, but something inside me compelled me to say \"... No?\" just for shit's and giggles. \n\n\"Dude. You HAVE GOT to come look at this. There is a literal shit puddle on and around my truck.\" \n\nI hadn't seen the puddle when I left earlier in the night since it was so dark. So I got up wondering what it would look like when I turn the corner and see it. \n\nIt was repulsive. It was all over his rim and then a massive puddle blob at the bottom near the tire, the area speckled with shit splash damage. \n\nAt this point I am trying my HARDEST to not fall over laughing. \n\nHe says \"Do you think it was a bear?\" which almost broke me. \n\nSo I got on my phone and googled images for \"Bear poop\" and scrolled until I found a pic of something that at least resembled what I had laid and said \"Yea this looks similar.\" \n\nSo he thought it was bear shit. \n\nBut were not done. \n\nWhen I get home I tell EVERYONE the story I am telling you here on Reddit. They all know it was me who laid the shit. And the funniest part is hearing my friend retell the story to our other friends (Who know the real story) and they keep laughing hysterically at random parts of the story and he's always like \"Wtf are you guys laughing at? We didn't even get to a good part?\" \n\nOne day I'll tell him. One day. Maybe take another all meat camping trip and try to \"see if the bear will come back.\"  \n\nEdit: I actually put 2 secrets here. Both dealing with butt releases. Here is the other one I originally out in the thread if anyone is interested. \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/76r87v/slug/dogkyta",

She was cheating on him with my stepdad.... she had also told him he would never see me again.... so he took his own life at his place of work after hours cuz he didnt know where else to go. I always thought my middle name being my stepdads first name was just a coincidence. Because i dont remember him coming into my life until a couple years later. My mom found out she was pregnant with my little sister 3 days after my dads death. Ive always resented my stepdad before cuz he burnt all my baby pictures with my dad in them and i never knew why... i look nothing like my stepdad btw and still havent confronted my mom.\n\nEdit: ive read most of your comments and im still going through them. Thank you all especially u/NJCuban \nIm going to take his advice and when the time comes talk to my mom and forgive her.\n\nAlso thank you from whoever for the reddit gold.

    "body": "My older brother sexually abused me and raped me in my sleep from the age of 4 years old. We're 5 years apart and he was always too old for it to be \"kids experimenting\". \n\nAs I got older it would start to wake me up and I would just lay there in fear with my eyes squeezed shut and hope it was dark enough that he couldn't see my face or didn't notice my breathing pick up in panic. He had issues and was violent and angry a lot. I didn't want to die or be hurt. I picked up habits of putting bells on my door handle, thumb tacks on my floor,  piling things behind my door, and nothing kept him out.  I convinced my mother someone was stealing my stuff (he was doing this too, as every time a new electronic or game would go missing it was after one of those nights) so she put TWO locks on my door; a handle lock and a hook and loop higher up. Didn't work. My door was mangled and I tried in every way possible to beg her for security cameras or a nanny cam or SOMETHING. I could never tell her the truth then. She denied me the camera. One night I left my phone recording audio, and my whole phone was mysteriously water damaged to no return the next morning. \n\nIt happened until I was 18 years old. I dropped out of high school because I was so depressed. I wasn't sleeping - I would stay awake for as long as possible in an attempt to keep him away but no one can stay awake forever.  I became heavily promiscuous, and always had a boyfriend or girlfriend sleep over when my mother would allow it. Someone else in the room was the only thing that kept me safe. I tried not coming home a lot but my mother would flip. \n\nIn 2015 I finally told her the truth after I found out he had a child with a girl he hooked up with. I didn't want that piece of trash anywhere near children. \n\nMy mother kicked ME out of house. Told ME someone with as many partners as I had could have never been raped. Told me it happened to her as a kid and she never told and \"turned out fine\". Clearly fucking not.\nMy older sister acted like I didn't exist, my dad told me he would rather go through chemo than ever have a daughter like me, there was an investigation open and childhood diaries and a shitty 5 second audioclip saved from the cloud wasn't enough and my case was closed. I got a retraining order anyways. \n\nI lived in a fucking shelter for 5 months of my life because I had nothing. Ended up dating a man way older than me who physically abused me because he paid for an apartment and food for me. I got a new job and worked my ass off until I could pay for my own place and then I changed my entire name legally, packed up my shit and left the apartment without saying a word.\n\nI wish my brother would fucking die. I used to see photos of my family, including my infant niece, all having a good happy family time and living fucking normal lives like I was never even born. Sometimes I wonder what my mother tells extended family when they ask why I'm not at family functions and haven't been in 3 years. I can't wait til the day my brother dies. \n\nI moved a 5 hour flight away and would have killed him myself had I not been kicked out by my mother. I really fucking would have. It's still in the back of my head. \n\nThe day he dies I'm going to show up at his funeral with fucking bells on and I will tell the WHOLE fucking truth to everyone there. \n\nMy parents attempt to talk to me, I send them screenshots of the things they said to me back then when they ask how I am. \n\nMy life is good now, I have my dream job, an amazing apartment and a boyfriend who I love more than anything - and he knows everything and still loves me too. I'm in a lot of antidepressant meds, and I have some PTSD issues but I'm in both general therapy and childhood rape specific therapy. \n\nSorry for the novel. I've never gotten the whole story out to more than one person that isn't a cop, a therapist or a doctor... \n\n\nEdits: small things. ",

I can\u2019t remember the branding or characters (but I doubt anyone will read this anyways).  The part I *do* remember is that it had his minigame in it where you could build a sandcastle.\n\nIt was honestly really cool for a kid like me, so I was always making sand castles with their preset buckets and shovels and spoons...\n\nWell, here\u2019s the thing.  The game featured this thing where if you clicked on background things, it would do a little animation.  For instance, maybe if you clicked on the sun it would put on sunglasses.  All I remember is that one of the people in the background, when clicked, would eat a hotdog with crunching sound effects.\n\nEven as a kid this bugged me to no end; hotdogs aren\u2019t crunchy!  They\u2019re soft, right?\n\nThen it hit me:  *there must be sand in that hotdog*\n\nWell for some reason that sounded *so damn good* to ~4 year old me.  Sandy crunchy hotdog?  Yum!  But I wasn\u2019t stupid.  I knew the world would shun me for my sandy hotdog ways, so I never acted on it.\n\nFor years and years and years I\u2019ve been in the sand-closet, craving that sandy hotdog.  I\u2019m an adult man now but I have to admit that if you handed me one right now, I might cry.\n\nThat is my deepest, darkest secret.\n\nEDIT:  No no no, chips won\u2019t do it and neither will toasting.  It\u2019s got to be sand.  The salt, the grit...  I can\u2019t quite describe it but it will never be satisfied by edible substitutes ",

    "body": "I feel terribly anxious all of the time and the smallest thing sets me into a panic. I feel paralyzed and scared. I don't know how to put it - its like a mounting feeling of dread. I am in therapy but it isn't helping.\n\nEdit: I am so overwhelmed by this positive response. I've gotten a lot of comments and PM's reassuring me it's going to be ok, giving me advice, or just offering to be an ear for me.\n\n I've gotten a lot of comments about changing therapists - I actually really like my therapist, but I haven't talked to her about my anxiety per se. I began going to her because I found myself disgusting, and I was deeply ashamed of who I was. It is difficult to articulate, but I have a lot of self-loathing. And I knew that it was totally irrational, but the shame was still there. Whenever I ate sweets, I imagined my stomach ballooning into a ball of fat and my cheeks get puffy with soft flesh. Whenever I made a joke that fell flat, I could feel the contempt radiating off the other people in the room. Whenever I took an extra oreo, danced awkwardly, or failed an exam, I thought I could see the disgust in everyone's eyes and the sneers on everyone's lips. I thought that I wasn't a real person - I was only good enough to use as a large paperweight, a boat anchor, or a talking garbage disposal, eating everything in sight and making obnoxious and stupid comments. And to top it off, I was ashamed of being ashamed, because I knew that my shame was irrational, and this irrational fixation was embarrassing me. I wanted to punish myself to absolve myself of this shame. I fantasize about drilling holes into my legs.\n\nWe've been making progress on some of this stuff - I don't hate myself as much, and we've found out that a lot of the issues I have stem from abusive parenting and loneliness. I wasn't a very social kid, was bullied and ostracized a bit. I didn't have any friends, and I think that took a toll on me. Because of that, I became desperate for people to see and love me, and that is where the fear started I think. But for some reason, I didn't link the tightness in my chest and my sense of panic to anxiety. I also didn't link my self-loathing and panic together. I think that the anxiety comes from a pressure to be someone who is loved and respected, and the self-loathing comes when I have failed to live up to my (or other people's) expectations. I think this is why therapy hasn't been helping me the way it could - while I could articulate why self-hate, I didn't know that the anxiety was at the root of it. So I could learn to love myself and get over my shame for a little bit, but those intrusive and panicky thoughts - that *fear* - would always wiggle its way back into my brain and I would be back to square one. Confronting my shame didn't mean that I was confronting my fear, if this makes any sense. And finally, my feelings of fear was never a \"condition\" to me. It was who I am. Being anxious was the default. It was normal. But I have recently realized that doing classwork shouldn't make me anxious to the point of tears. I shouldn't cry every time I take a test, and pacing back and forth in the dorm basements at 2 am because I am too scared to start my OChem homework is not normal. I made this post because now that I knew about it, how would I explain it? How could I talk about this in a way that doesn't make me look crazy or weak? I am so glad that none of you called me weak. \n\nI hope that gives you a bit of perspective on why and how it is difficult to articulate this to myself. I think I have a lot more internalized issues to work out than I thought I did, and I will be talking to my therapist about medication. Thank you all so much again for listening to me and for your advice. I know I rambled a bit in this edit, but I felt that I owed you all an explanation. I probably won't be able to respond to all of the comments, but I have read every one.",

    "body": "My mom abused me for my entire childhood by either being active in the mistreatment, or being silent and allowing her boyfriend to do it. \n\nFast forward to now, her mental health issues are taking a toll. She is a drunk, meth user, and gambling addict. When she calls me it is like someone I dont even know. \n\nLast week she was in the hospital for a heart attack, and I really wish she would just die. \n\nI lost her when I was a kid. I feel like this other is an imposter, and I just want it to die and for her, and I'm not gonna lie, my, pain to end.   \n\nEdit: I just want to say that the response to this post has been a mixture of sadness and happiness for me. I would like to give a somewhat brief overview to my story, and perhaps it will help others. \n\nI don't remember when the abuse started. But my earliest memories are of it occurring. Here is a funny joke. What does someone who wears glasses and someone who is  abused from an early age have in common?\n\n They think how they see the world is normal. \n\nI never thought to question anything, ever. For a number of years. I was a quiet child and didn't make many friends because people scared me. By the time I realized something was terribly wrong in my household, I refused to let the few friends I did have over. \n\nI have a very vivid memory of being small, I must have been around four, because my younger brother was an infant. My mother had taken the three of us into one of the bedrooms and locked the door while her boyfriend smashed things downstairs, and was just losing his mind(he was a meth head too)he had a cattle prod and I could hear the crackling of the electricity through the walls. My mom had burns from it all over her arms. She asked me, a small child, if I would call the police if he broke in. \n\nI started crying, and begged her to please not make me. That I would get in trouble, and he would hurt me and I was scared. \n\nShe asked me, \"Do you want me to die?\" \n\nThose words are so clear in my mind, I can still hear it perfectly. To this day I have nightmares of having to call 911, and not being able to speak, or pushing the wrong buttons. \n\nThe abuse became worse. Every trip to the hospital was an accident. Every public outburst was treated as a parent having to wrangle an unruly young kid. \n\nI tried to run away in the winter. I packed some clothes in my little backpack and went out onto the ice of a river near our house. I laid down out in the middle, in the cold, and day dreamed. Just watching the snow fall down. I was nice and warm in my coat and multi layered pants(my parents would never buy a snowsuit for me). \n\nBut I went back. Because I was scared of what would happen to my mom. Her boyfriend always told me that if I ran away, he would kill her and my brother, and keep me alive so that I would have the memory. \n\nI stayed until I was 14 and he tried to drown me in dirty dish water. I ran, and started living at a friends house. My mom would call constantly, begging me to come back. That things had gotten so much worse for her. But I was too afraid, and the guilt piled up. \n\nHe ended up leaving when I was 18. I have not talked to him since. I consider the time I was around him like a terrible, horrible nightmare. \n\nMy mother spiraled. What was once a functional alcoholic turned I to a complete mess. She turned to prostetution to subsidize her addiction. She lived on the streets, and every time I moved and slowly got better, she would call and ask for money. I gave in to that for a long time. \n\nI was hospitalized and diagnosed with a number of mental disorders. She called me a malingerer, and that my pain was nothing in comparison to her own. \n\nI got married, and had two wonderful children. She tells me my husband Wil leave because I am crazy, that my children will grow to be addicts, and that I am her clone. That I can't escape it. \n\nShe is like a voice in my head, berating me. While at the same time working her way back in like some sort of abusive spouse. \n\nWhen I listen to music intended for exes, it makes me think of her. Adele's Hello, is about my mom for me. \n\nTo everyone who has dealt with a similar situation, you are amazing. You are strong. You will get through this. When I was young, every fucking day was hell. I thought it would never fucking end. \n\nBut it did. It WILL get better. You just have to make it better.\n\nI love you all. I dont know who the hell you are, or what you have been through, but I love you.   \n\nMore edit: To every comment that said I won't read your comment, I do. I read every one. Keep them coming. Its just dinner time, and I have to make my children foods, so I can't respond right away.  \n\n**Another edit**: To the people saying, \"I didn't have it this bad.\" Or \"Wow, what I went through is nothing in comparison.\" \n\nStop it. You just stop it right now!\n\nYou have pain. You are allowed to feel it without feeling bad and comparing it to another person's pain and suffering. We dont sit around comparing our joys do we? You don't win a hundred dollars off of a scratch ticket and immediately tell yourself, \"Well this is stupid, I dont have as much money as Bill Gates.\" \n\nYour suffering is just as god damn legitimate as mine, because its you who felt it!

    "body": "Late to the party, but this is a story I\u2019ve never told anyone. The year was 1980-something and I was in fifth grade. I was a chubby white nerd. There was an Arab kid from 6th grade who used to bully me with his friends. Mostly just shoving, name calling, and heckling, but there were a few times they got really nasty. Once was when I was feeling sick and I was in the bathroom at school. By total coincidence, the leader of this group saw me go in. I puked in the toilet and the next thing I knew, he was behind me and pushed my face into my own puke. Another time, they picked up some dog shit on the way home, put it in a paper bag, ran up behind me, and smashed the bag of dog shit on my head. This kind of stuff, mostly just heckling and fear-jeering, happened every day after school. They lived one block past me, so no matter what route I took home, they could follow without being inconvenienced. \n\nEvery day, as I\u2019d break off toward my house at the end of my walk, the leader kid would say, \u201cyou know you better not tell anyone, right?!\u201d  I\u2019d say nothing. And I told no one. After stuff like the puke and dog shit incidents, he\u2019d grab me, get in my face, make some comment about how I was a total piece of garbage, and then he\u2019d say, \u201cif you tell anyone, I will kill you.\u201d  I never told anyone because the way he said it made me believe he\u2019d either kill me or beat me to within an inch of my life. \n\nMy uncle was a trucker. (Not actually my uncle, but I called him my uncle.)  He used to drive cross-country and he always took his dog, Brutus.  Despite his tough name, Brutus was a tiny Pomeranian.  We were at his house and he was telling us a story about two guys who tried to rob him at a truck stop while he was walking his dog. \n\nHaving been a trucker for 20+ years, he was used to seedy characters and hookers and drug dealers at truck stops. He was also well aware of wildlife that would come out to scrounge in the dumpsters and had come face to face with hungry forest creatures who thought his dog was a meal. Whenever he\u2019d go out at night, he\u2019d take his tire-thumper. It\u2019s basically an 18-24 inch hard wooden stick used to test semi truck tires. Don\u2019t ask how it works. I\u2019m not a trucker. \n\nAnyway, the two guys confront him and as he goes for his wallet, he grabs the thumper hanging off his belt instead. He whacks one guy in the head and the other runs away. He takes off and he ended his story by saying that he didn\u2019t know how hard he hit the guy. He wonders, to this day, if he actually may have killed the guy, but he said he looked at newspapers and never found anything. But this was the 80\u2019s, once he left town, it would probably be hard to look up something like that. \n\nAnyway, as he told his story, all I could think of was \u201cman, I wish I had a tire thumper to take care of that prick who bullies me!\u201d  I think of his comment about the forest creatures and I ask if he has another tire thumper because there\u2019s a mean dog that barks at me when I walk my own dog and that thumper sounds like good protection in case the dog ever comes after us. He takes me out to his garage and hands me a tire thumper. I still remember that he had like 20 of them and they all had logos on them. I guess banks give out free pens with \u201cChase Bank\u201d and truck supply places give out free tire thumpers with \u201cTony\u2019s Truck Part Emporium.\u201d  (The one he gave me was from \u201cNational Truck Parts.\u201d)\n\nThe bullying continues. I keep the thumper in the umbrella sleeve on the side of my backpack. I\u2019m too afraid to use it. It\u2019s always 3 or 4 against 1. I might whack one, but the others could get me. I bide my time.  On occasion, I see him alone after school, so I figure maybe I\u2019ll make the one-on-one stand at that point. I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m just scared overall. This fucking kid is like well beyond twice my size. He was probably a retard who got held back and should have been in high school. I don\u2019t really know, but he was by far, the biggest kid in school. \n\nAnyway, my school is doing a project on Liberty and every class is making models of some kind of monument. BIG models. My class was doing the Statue of Liberty out of chicken wire and clay and papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9. The teacher offered extra credit for anyone who stayed after school. I stayed. \n\nI\u2019m walking home after school figuring I\u2019m safe since they left over an hour ago. Lo and behold, here comes the bully right behind me. He must have stayed with his class too. He\u2019s alone. He\u2019s not saying anything. Just walking. \n\nI get to what we called \u201cThe Trails.\u201d  It\u2019s a chunk of land where no houses had been built on the block. It was about 6 empty plots on one side and two on the other (shaped like an L, so you could cut through the middle instead of going all the way around the block). It was like a sparse forest and kids would come here to ride their bikes on the little trails that weaved through the trees and around the bushes. I would always take this short cut on my way to school, but never on the way home (they usually weren\u2019t there to follow me to school, so I felt safe cutting through the little woods in the morning). \n\nThis time, I decided to take the shortcut home and if he followed me, I\u2019d beat his ass. \n\nAs I got to The Trails, he started up with \u201chey fatso!\u201d and \u201cI don\u2019t have my boys!  You think you can take me?\u201d  Taunting bullshit. \n\nI got about 20 feet into the woods and I heard him say, \u201cHey, if I cut your fat ass up in here, nobody\u2019s gonna find you for days!\u201d\n\nI looked back and he had a pocket knife. He was waving it at me. \n\nI said something like, \u201cJust leave me alone!\u201d And he said, \u201cTime to gut a little piggy!\u201d\n\nHe started running at me. I grabbed my tire thumper and swung blindly. I heard a crack and a scream. It was a blood curdling scream. I don\u2019t even know what I hit, but he was on the ground crying like a baby. I lifted the thumper above my head to beat the ever-loving shit out of him and he screamed for me to stop. My blind rage/fear clicked off. He was begging me to go get help. \n\nBeing a kid, I said something like, \u201cI don\u2019t want to get in trouble\u201d or some stupid shit. But I was starting to feel really really bad about this. I mean, he was hurt. He was hurt bad. I was just about to take my lumps and run to get help when through his tears, he said, \u201cGo get me help, you fat fucking pussy!\u201d\n\nI thought for a second, rage clicked on, and I brought that thumper down on his thigh as hard as I could. I heard a crack and that rage clicked off immediately and turned to confusion. Not remorse. Maybe fear?  I don\u2019t know. He screamed again. The begging continued. He pleaded for me to get help. Now, all of a sudden, he was being very polite. \n\nOut of nowhere, I heard someone yelling from the street 20-30-40 feet away, \u201cYou okay in there?! Hello?!\u201d\n\nI dropped down, covered his mouth with my hand, looked him straight in the eye, and said, \u201cIf you tell anyone, I will fucking kill you with your own knife after I break *both* your fucking legs!\u201d  Apparently, I\u2019m a good actor because his eyes reflected the fact that he totally believed me and completely understood. \n\nI took his pocket knife, hunkered down, and ran out of the forest toward my house. \n\nHe wasn\u2019t in school for about a week. Without him, his buddies left me alone on the way home. When he came back, he had an arm in a cast (first hit - the blind one) and his leg in a cast (second hit). \n\nThe story he gave everyone was that he was walking through The Trails and fell off the makeshift ramp some kids built for their bikes. \n\nHe never bothered me again. His friends never bothered me either. I kept that thumper with me every day though. Probably stupid to carry around the weapon, but I was maybe 10 or 11 at most. I didn\u2019t know any better. I stashed his pocket knife in the attic of my grandfather\u2019s house that weekend.  Grandma died shortly thereafter and Grandpa immediately moved into a retirement community after selling the house. I never had a chance to go back. I wonder if it\u2019s still there.\n\nIn any case, that was the only thing I\u2019ve ever done that outright hurt another person and it\u2019s probably the only story I haven\u2019t told anyone. Not my wife, not my best friends, no one.\n\nA few follow up notes. Yes, I feel horrible about it. I always have, but I justify it because of the bullying. And when I was about to go get him help and bite the bullet for what I\u2019d done, he pushed me again. I just snapped. And, of course, he recovered, so it\u2019s not like I left him crippled for life. I\u2019ve Googled him over the years and while he was arrested for domestic battery and animal abuse (in the late 90\u2019s), he owns his own business now and his Facebook page gives the impression that he\u2019s turned himself around. He\u2019s married to another lady and has a couple kids. I think it\u2019s kind of interesting that he\u2019s Arab and his wife is Mexican. She\u2019s a big lady and I have a feeling that if he tried smacking her around, she\u2019d lay his ass out worse than I did. I guess maybe a good woman *can* make a bad man good. \n\nEdit: Grammar and spelling. ",

I didn't understand what she meant but eventually told my mom because my friend said she wanted it to stop. My mom didn't know what to do - for some reason, it's easier to hope the victim is just misunderstanding the situation than to accept that they're actually being abused. \n\nMy mom eventually told the girl's mom and she didn't believe us at first. She was pregnant with the dude's kid, so I understand wanting it to not be true. We moved soon after so I wasn't sure what happened until years later and me and my mom saw the guy at a grocery store. He was with a different woman (so we assumed the woman and her daughter got out of the bad situation), but this new woman had kids too. My mom confronted him and tried to tell the woman he was with, but she didn't seem to understand much English. It's still makes me sick to think about, but it's not my fault.\n\nIt's the abusers' fault for being shitty humans. You just have to remind yourself that. \n\nMy mom reconnected with the woman at one point and she apparently left him soon after everything went down, but I don't know about the new woman he was with.

Honestly, I can't really attribute my change in feelings toward death to any one particular event or thought, but there were a few things that helped me along the way:\n\n- I realized that my fear of death was more a fear of leaving behind all of the people and hobbies I enjoy in life.  I think this helped me to disassociate with the direct physical effects of death (because really, most of us don't know how it will happen) and allowed me to compartmentalize what actually scared me about it.\n- I started exercising several times a week.  Running sucks, but it made me feel better both physically and mentally.  This was particularly helpful for me when a panic attack was imminent because it forced me to regulate my breathing.\n- It may sound weird, but I started to equate death to sleep.  I'm not a dreamer.  I literally go to bed most nights and wake up the next morning with a 6-8 hour void of time that basically vanishes into the ether.  I'm also not much of a believer in the unknown, so I can't imagine that death is much different than that empty space of time I experience every night when I go to sleep, and that isn't so bad to me.\n\nEdit:  Thanks for the gold kind stranger!",

I had been drinking and wearing that fucking dress that now had his cum on it. My sister made her profile picture on Facebook of him and her. To teach me a lesson about \u201cbeing over dramatic\u201d. Before that day, I would have died for her if she had asked. \n\nIt was really hard for a long time. No one believed me so I pretended it had never happened(really bad idea btw). It took me a year just to say the words out loud again to another person. To actually use the word \u201crape\u201d. It was just a random person on the end of a hotline, but I had said it. I had some really hard New Years eves. Typically the week before I start to get panic attacks. It consumes my thoughts and I don\u2019t let my SO hold me at night, in the dark. Last year though. 4 years after, I had my first proper New Years kiss. My boyfriend encouraged me to have one glass of champagne and held my had for most of the night. I even danced a little! \n\nAs many have said before, you took a HUGE step today! You should be SO PROUD!!!! Please remember that you can get back what Ian took from you. You are stronger and smarter than he even will be.

Incomplete and broken, and all these people were capable of smiling, and I could do nothing but cry. Eventually, I stopped crying, I could eat again, I stopped drinking so much, I cut back on the smoking, I stopped wanting die. It took a long time, I looked like a shell of my former self. I was dangerously underweight, but now I'm healthy again. It hurts that he's gone, and I love him and miss him, but the fact that he died, doesn't mean I have to. I decided I would do all of these things he wanted to do. It started out that I was going to wait to kill myself until after I finished getting a tattoo he always wanted, and going to a show he bought tickets for, and all of his memorial services and benefit concerts were over. By the time I did all if that, I didn't want to die anymore. I wanted to make him proud, I wanted to live for him, to keep going because that's what I would want him to do\n\nIt helps if you think about what they would want. Did they want you to be happy? If the answer is yes, you need to keep going through the days until you don't want die anymore. It's one step at a time.",

And constantly pushed it on me.  \"You can sleep over Saturday, if you come to church with us on Sunday. \" \"you're having a hard time because you haven't accepted Jesus. \"  that type of stuff.  In jr high there's a class that's part of curriculum called seminary. You do this from 7th to 12th grade if you're Mormon.  His mom and dad said to him they didn't care if he graduated highschool,  but he WILL graduate seminary.  He dropped out of church around 16. They blamed me and my influence.  Mind you I've never said anything to him about it up to this point about being Mormon.  He was my buddy.  I accepted it.  His parents un invited me to anything after that.  Even their home.  Well. Fast forward a bit.  We're about 30 at this point.  My buddy wants to come over and needs to talk.  Ok.  Come over man.  He tells me his dad is leaving the church.  Had a family meeting and said it's all bullshit,  he's thought so for years.  Even before my buddy left the church.  He wants to meet with me to apologize for the 15 year shit treatment i received.  It fucked the family up. Bad.  For a little bit.  Then everyone accepted it. And it got better.  It was a huge shock because it carried on for so long. Be open.

He is having major health issues and I feel it would be best if he just left earth. It would be much better for all of us. It's not even him anymore\n\n\nEdit : to expand- he just told everyone yesterday that he has a brain tumor and the whole family didn't even bat an eye. He's put us all through so much hell the past 14 years and everyone is just done with it. He would give me xanax when I was around 14 on a regular basis. I had no idea what it really was and the reprocussions it would have on my life. I had to go to rehab at a very young age because of it, being full blown addicted to xanax as a 10th grader was terrible. 13 years later and he's gotten worse every year. Destroyed every holiday, destroyed my credit through fraud(knowingly), drugs has destroyed my family. The last text I got from him said word for word \"you disgust me hero boy, your the worse son that could ever been born. Fucking theif. I hate your fucking guts, all I have is hate for you. Don't bother showing up to my funeral. You turned out to be a real bastard.\"\n\nI got that text at 4am in the morning, and the reason was (I kid you not) he found a tape measure in his car and thought it was a tool used to break into cars, and he thought I broke into his car and stole some pills. I'm 5 years sober and was in town to my mother and sister for a few days. And all of this doesn't even scratch the surface. There are things like breaking my door down high on crystal meth and forcing me to call my mother to take him back. I was 12 and was happy that she finally had enough.\n\n\nEdit 2 : wow you guys are really fucking incredible. I really really appreciate the supportive comments. I can't believe a fake piece of gold put the biggest smile on my face lol. I'm a total bro but you guys hit me right in the feels <3 and thanks again kind stranger!",

There are a bunch of adventures you can find for free online for low-level players, and you'll also need some friends to play them with.\n\nI suggest playing something like [this introductory adventure](http://www.rpgbot.net/dnd35/howtoplay/adventure/) to learn the rules before you start, because your players are going to be asking you questions and you need to be able to answer them. Don't forget, as DM you get to make up the rules, so if you can't remember something and can't find the applicable rule quickly it's okay if you just make something up that's about right.\n\n^(^I'd ^actually ^suggest ^Pathfinder ^over ^DnD ^3.5, ^but ^the ^joke ^only ^works ^with ^DnD.)\n\nedit:  \nIf you're running an adventure someone else wrote, and they included stats for all the encounters they included, you can probably get away with just a copy of the player's handbook. Alternatively, you can find most of the rules you'll need online [here](http://www.d20srd.org/). For Pathfinder, a (much more comprehensive) SRD can be found [here](http://d20pfsrd.com/).",
