    "body": "I'm assuming that you've been to a neurologist about this and have had the proper testing. (If not, this would be an important thing to do.) Generally speaking, the reason you're feeling the itch is because your nerves are not completely dead. Itching can be a sign of healing, wires being crossed, or really sporadic signals the nerves are getting. Depending on exactly what is causing the itch, there are a couple ways to go about treating it. \n\nThe first one is operating under the assumption that the nerves are being cut off because of inflammation of some sort. If you have EDS, this is a common problem. A back or joint injury could also cause this. To deal with it, your doctor should prescribe you with an anti-inflammatory. Mobic is what I see most often being successful, but there are definitely other ones out there. \n\nThe second option is to take Atarax (brand)/Hydroxizine HCL (generic). It is an allergy medication, but it works differently than most antihistamines. It actually stops the itch on a neurological level. For example, someone with multiple sclerosis might be prescribed this to stop the pinpoint shock-like nerve problems, which can also show up as intense itching. I've known one person with a TBI who developed compulsive scratching, and this worked well for him as well. This is one of those medications that a lot of doctors won't prescribe routinely simply because they're not familiar with it, despite it being an older medication. If you decide to go this route, know that there are two forms of it. You want the HCL version that comes in a tablet, not the one that comes in a capsule. The capsule one will work more quickly but it'll also wear off sooner. Also, the standard dose is 25mg, depending on what it's being prescribed for, but it's safe at much higher doses. I take 100mg 2-3 times a day. The lower dose did absolutely nothing for me, but I don't have anywhere near as many nerve problems on this dose, so it might be worthwhile to try a higher dose of the lower doesn't work for you. It does make most people tired, but you can build a tolerance to that. Just play it safe in terms of your activities until you're certain it's not going to affect you like that. \n\nAnother option would be to take something that actually changes the blood flow in your brain. This is, of course, assuming that the problem isn't elsewhere, like your back. I know there are other medications out there that function like this, but the only ones I can think of off the top of my head are Provigil/modafinil and the newer version, Nuvigil/armodafinil. Both of these are classified as narcolepsy drugs, but they're finding that it helps tremendously with things like dysautonomia/POTS, MS, depression, and so on. Like the Atarax, some people need a higher dose for it to be effective. \n\nIt seems to me that I was reading about another medication recently that would potentially be helpful, but I can't remember what it was. If I do, I'll edit my comment. ",

Then, a month or two later... it happens again. Clear as day, they KNOW they heard it. They ask around to figure out who's fucking with them. It's more annoying than anything so theyre not too mad... until it happens again, a couple months after the last. Now its been awhile, the joke's not funny anymore - someone, fess up. But no one does. The victim starts to distrust their friends and family a little. The joke's starting to be mean, but it doesn't stop. Obviously someone dislikes them. The victim begins to feel unwanted by their friends, although that's not the case. They start to suspect maybe it's some crazed murderer or something - but why haven't they done anything yet? Another couple months, another scream. If they want to do something to the victim, then do it already! Another scream. Maybe it's in their head? But they KNOW they can hear it, even if everyone else denies it. Another scream. They start to scream back in desperation. Friends and family, those that are still around, begin to get deeply worried. Another scream. Maybe a home for... people like them is best. Yknow, for people... not quite right in the head. Another scream. Even though it's infrequent, the victim can't help but stay up every night. Waiting. Another scream. Another. Another. Until their death.",

Thanks to tons of physio (most of which I can't even remember), some sort of Russian electric treatment as a child, and two very devoted parents, my arm now works, I have full manual dexterity, and I even became right handed for writing (although not other things)! \n\nThe only remaining issues are:\n\n-my elbow is somewhat bent so my arm is never fully straight unless someone pulls my hand, \n\n-once or twice a year it gets that weird electric feeling like when you wake up a limb that went numb, only more intense and for longer, and\n\n-two numb spots, one on my forearm and one close to my shoulder, which leads to the itchy problem.\n\nI considered these minor problems compared to the possibility of not being able to move my right arm at all, and I always just figured I was hella lucky to get this far. I didn't bother to think of whether more improvement was even possible. I realize now that was probably the wrong attitude to adopt. There's no reason not to try to make things better, or at least to inquire about it. \n\nSo, whether this helps or not, thank you!",

I would easily take 50 more kidney stones if it would keep me from going through that again. This is coming from somebody who has been hospitalized with kidney stones more than once. \n\nCorneal ulcer, worst pain I've ever had.  It's basically a gaping wound on your eyeball, and there's nothing you can do to ease the pain. Pain pills don't even take the edge off. You can't sleep, and you have to put drops of alternating antibiotics in your eyes every 15 minutes. That's not every 15 minutes while you're awake, that's **every 15 minutes** for weeks. You couldn't sleep anyway, because the only thing more god awfully painful than the torture of keeping your eye open, is closing it.  I spent weeks delirious from lack of sleep, and in constant searing pain in a dark room. I couldn't look at anything or read anything or watch anything, I just laid there with my eyes open, thrashing around and wanting to die. I definitely lost my mind a little. ",
