When my father finally moved out and asked for a Divorce I was luckily old enough (13) to legally decide who I wanted to live with. I, of course, chose my dad and that enraged my mother. By court order, she was allowed to live in our 4 bedroom house while me and my dad had to move in with my aunt into a two bedroom house. We lived there for 4 years while my mom did everything she could to slow down the divorce proceedings. During this period my father was court ordered to pay the mortgage and utilities on the house my mother was living in. She would leave all the lights on and crank the heat with the widows open just to drive the utility bills up. She once left the garden hose on for a week into a drain to even make the Water bill outrageous. When it was finally all over and she had taken my dad for as much as she could she decided to sue him for my college fund. I called her and told her if she went through with it I would never speak to her again, she told me if I wanted it I needed to move in with her before I turned 18 so she could get child support from my dad. I refused, she won the case for the money and my dad had to use most of what was left of the fund to pay for her lawyers costs. ",

She was so in love with this internet guy that she didn't care.  He was in school halfway around the country and she was going to move there to be with him; we knew we'd get by just fine.  They seemed amicable and it was understood how this would all play out.  \n\nThe day in court finally comes and instead of what we all assumed, even my dad's lawyer - she goes to the court with all these crazy claims.  He was an abusive alcoholic, he beat us and my mom nightly, he was crazy and no one would be safe in his care.  My mom got full custody, she got 50% of his house and 50% of his retirement account.  My dad was stunned - that judgement would basically bankrupt him - in order for him to keep the house, he'd essentially have to clean out his retirement account and give her everything.   \n\nThe night of their divorce I went over to see him.  He was almost catatonic - he just stared off in space the entire time and would mumble whenever I asked him a question.  I've never seen anyone like that ever.  My birthday was 2 days away and I asked if he wanted to do something for my birthday and he just answered with \"your mom has full custody.  I will if she allows me to see you.\"  I asked if I could drive his old truck to school, since I didn't yet have a car and he just said no, that I needed to call my mom and have her pick me up.  So that's what I did. \n\nAnd the next day in school, the day before my birthday, I'm sitting in our lunchroom when I hear \"hey, isn't that your grandpa?\" From a buddy of mine.  I look over and see my grandpa and a cop making their way across the lunchroom toward me.  They told me to grab my stuff and in the office I found my sister there as well.  We rode home with them, where we were also met by my little sister and that's where they told us that our dad had killed himself, shortly after I left the previous night. \n\nTo make matters worse, it all happened so quickly that nothing had been finalized.  My mom dropped all her paperwork and legally became a widow and got everything - house, retirement and his insurance policy.  She also got social security benefits for us, a fact we didn't find out until much later.  She basically took all the money and moved across the country with her new man, leaving us to care for ourselves for the most part.\n\n And to this day, when asked about raising us, she'll spin this story of a young widow, doing her best to raise three kids on her own..",

    "body": "Not a lawyer but my two bosses were married and opened a bike shop together. He was the brains and the backbone since he was a former Olympic mechanic, she just sort of balanced the checkbook and worked a couple days a week. Unfortunately, he had no credit and she did, so when they opened everything was in her name. \n\nAll he wanted in the divorce was the bike shop and was willing to buy her half. She wanted the bike shop too, but didn't want to buy him out for his half. Mind you, her father passed away and she was sitting on like $300k in the bank (and also had the audacity to take out student loans for her daughter to go to college). \n\nHe lost the bike shop and I think he got a little bit of money for his share. What she didn't expect was that all of the high-paying customers would stop going there. They were all his friends or they only wanted him to work on their bikes (so I don't know why she would have had that notion). So he opened up his own bike shop and all of the \"regulars\" have become regulars at the new bike shop. \n\nEDIT: I've been seeing a lot of comments asking how he gained the credit to open a new shop. Ever since he moved out of the house he shared with his ex wife, he started putting money away and got a credit card. So over the course of a year+ some months he built credit and was able to open a shop on his own. People have tried to \"buy-in\" to the business as an investment but he doesn't want anyone else involved since that screwed him over the first time. \n\nEDIT 2: I appreciate everyone's upvotes. If anyone is ever having any bike-related issues, head on over to r/bikewrench. I spend a lot of time there diagnosing and offering fixes for people's bikes. I don't work in a bike shop anymore, I just work on my friends' bikes for fun, and dabble in some frame building for myself. But remember to support your local bike shop. Don't buy bikes from department stores because they're typically dangerous as they aren't built by actual bike mechanics.",

Your lawyer is paid a set amount if he/she is paid by the government. However, should the money you recieve after a divorce or w/e exceed a certain number, you are expected to pay your own lawyer (which is the reason we still keep track of the hours in these cases).

    "body": "My step dad has been divorced twice before, both marriages had kids involved. First divorce was mutual, and had shared custody of the kids, second was because he was cheated on and also involved shared custody of kids. \n\nWife #1 lived out of state, and kept no-showing, forcing costly legal action every time he wanted to see his kid. Wife #2 was initially supportive of him through this, until they had kids themselves and the cost became too much. Wife #1 wanted him to give up legal rights to their kids, and after years and years of legal battles that nearly bankrupted them, Wife #2 basically gave him an ultimatum - give up the kids, or get divorced. He knew that getting divorced from wife #2 could result in him never seeing his other kids either so eventually he was forced into giving up kid #1. \n\nA few years later Wife #2 cheats on him, they get divorced, wife #2 tells the kids it was him that cheated, but to never mention it to him in case he gets angry. Initially they were splitting custody very evenly, but eventually wife #2 figured out that she would get more money if she was technically sole custodian, and he would see them on that basis because he loves his children. So to arrange for this to happen she accused him of molesting their youngest child, then used that accusation to gain full custody before the charge was dropped due to total lack of evidence. Then she tells the kids that he did molest them, again something he didn't know she told them for years. \n\nUpshot is that he was forced to give up first kids permanently by one wife, and then second wife had the rest of his kids think he was a cheater and sexual predator, and thus be terrified of him and never truly love him, so she could save face and pick up a larger check. \n\nLike Tammy#1 and Tammy#2 on crack.\n\nEDIT: Also to be 100% clear this story has details omitted or changed for the purpose of not identifying anyone. If this sounds like someone you know then I fully empathise with them but we probably aren't talking about that same person, which in it's self is terribly sad, I think. ",

    "body": "Lawyer here, although I try to stay as far away from family law as possible. This story is from about ten years ago when I was working for the prosecutor's office. For those that don't know, the prosecutor is enabled by federal law to enforce child support orders.\n\nOne day I got a call from a pretty irate guy who said he got a letter from the IRS stating that we intercepted his tax return. It was common thing, so I told him I'd look into it. He went on about how he wasn't a dead beat dad and how he took care of his kids and all. I told him I'd look into it and took his information down.\n\nAbout 20 minutes later I got a call from the ex-wife saying he wasn't a deadbeat. I asked if he called her and she said he did. I pulled his file and it said he was over $20,000 in arrears for child support and she said she took care of his kids. I told her his tax return got intercepted and that was the first she heard of that. She asked what was going to happen to it, and I said it would be transferred to her. But, she could just come in and fill out an affidavit and we could waive his arrears. She said she'd call me back. When she did, she asked how much the return was, and I told her I didn't know. She said she'd call back again.\n\nI talked to the guy about a week later, and he faxed me copies of cancelled checks that he provided to the ex-wife on a weekly basis for slightly above the child support ordered amount. That was his problem. For child support, you submit the payments to the clerk of the court, not to the other spouse directly (it prevents this issue). He requested a hearing and got one granted. \n\nI wanted to help this guy, but I couldn't. I kept advising that he get a lawyer (this was pretty easy), but he didn't listen. He showed up at the hearing with check duplicates and the wife said she got those checks from him for another child and that's why she paid him directly (they had another child after they were divorced). Judge ruled against him.\n\nHis tax return was around $6,200. ",

In the police report, she wrote my apartment's address as her place of residence. A court immediately issued a restraining order against me, prohibiting me from being in my apartment (that I rented).\n\nWhile the restraining order was active (several months) I had to live in hotels and Airbnbs, which of course is 2x-3x of normal rent, without having access to my clothes and other stuff. I also was paying the rent for the apartment that was empty all that time (she never actually went there during that restraining order, even though she claimed it as her residence). \n The restraining order was lifted as the case was dismissed after she never provided any evidence or even testimony to DA.\n\nI didn't sign lease extension in time during this process because I had no information how long the restraining order will be for; even though it was lifted right before my lease expired, I ended up having to move (and pay a broker fee).\n\nOf course this also delayed divorce proceedings because we couldn't communicate while the restraining order was active.\n\nBesides that, she refused to sign tax form for \"married filing jointly\". I ended up filing as \"married filing separately\", which meant quite a few thousand dollars extra in payment to IRS.\n\nThis was the biggest case of 'fuck you over without any gain for me' that I have seen.",

    "body": "A bit of a different perspective here, from someone viewing the whole mess as a relative. The husband was severely fucked over by the wife purely because she could. She divorced him in a no-fault state, providing her with immediate out-of-pocket support from him until the end of the divorce, as well as all bills paid. Now this doesn't sound so bad...if the wife wasn't an abusive, vindictive, bipolar monster. He's a gentle man, you know...the good husband type. But she just kept at it , arguing with family, abusing children, attempting suicide by sleeping pills, the works. The woman was an absolute trainwreck. And due to the laws of the state, despite firing 4 attorneys, and telling all of them \"oh just send the attorney costs to my husband, have him pay\", the court just shrugged their shoulders.\n\nAnd the divorce carried on for nearly 4 years because the state did not require a settlement be made, so she just kept declining all of his offers while continuing to bask in free income. It even got to the point where he was offering half a mil over the next 4 years and she said 'go fuck yourself'. Over those 4 years his appearance and personality was like that of a president serving a term. It was absolutely awful to see. \n\nEdit; \n\nconsolation: kids are all adults and mostly unaffected by the divorce.\n\nHeartbreaker: divorce started after 27 years of marriage. So no, it wasn't a newlywed thing. Life's not always peachy after the first half decade.\n\nIf it makes it any better though the woman is mentally psychotic (unrelated to the bipolar) so this wasn't a standard \"falling out of love\" thing.",

I guess it counts as a revenge.\n> I worked with a guy who really stuck it to his ex wife. When I met him he was working in a sporting goods store making 8 dollars an hour. He was not really like the other retail monkeys. He was older, well groomed, well spoken, clearly educated etc. One night after work he gets into his car, and I couldn't help but notice that it was a very very nice newish Jaguar. I asked him how he could afford it and he explained it to me:\n> He had been an SVP at a well known fortune 50 company (which I will NOT mention the name of!), pulling in 300k with bonuses and stock options. He was married but the marriage fell apart and in the divorce, she demanded that she get the house and 40% of his wages. He and his lawyer somehow managed to get her to agree to let him keep the house in exchange for 75% of his pay..no dollar figure or employer specified lol. As soon as she took the settlement he quit his job and looked for a minimum wage job. He said to me that \"She gets 75% of nearly nothing now\". He had other money stashed away, so he didn't even need the job and he had the house and it's equity as well. Also, no kids, so there was no child support. Just alimony.\n> She was furious of course, and tried to re-sue him but failed at least once and when she claimed that the settlement was not keeping her in the life style she was accustomed to, he simply told the judge that the divorce was traumatic to him and he could no longer do his old job as a result. At least at that time, she did not manage to get out of the deal. Not sure how it all ended. But I thought it was fucking brilliant if not crazy-level spiteful.\n> He was a good employee too...good with customers, showed up on time, no bullshit absenteeism or anything like that. He claimed he loved each payday because it reminded him how little she was getting.\n> ",

    "body": "I'm not a lawyer but I am going through a divorce currenty. \nWe separated 3 years ago and I didn't really have the money for a divorce I was expecting. April 2016 we file jointly. I sign the papers I begin to think I was completely wrong about this and I was just being too cautious. Three weeks I recieve a call from someone trying to serve me papers. I was expecting to get just a temporary order, but instead, I recieved a temporary order and 2 temporary restraining orders (TRO) filed on behalf of my children by their mom. Obviously the charges were ludicrous but the state takes these allegations seriously. The judge threw out the TRO's but those allegations set off a chain reaction of absolute hell that still exist today.\nLater that summer, while wrapping gifts for my kids birthday, I got a knock at the door. It's the police. They received a \"anonymous\" tip that I enjoy downloading and distributing child pornography. After they confiscated my computers and several hard drives and found nothing, I was given my hardware back. Currenty there is a standing order sent from my second lawyer that I cannot be contacted by any police dept in my metro area without her present. \n\nFrom the very beginning I believed and assumed that my ex was coaching my children to lie and to fear me. I told anyone who would listen but it did very little good. After a court ordered psych review on the entire family, a glimmer of hope appeared on the horizon. She stated that she believed that the children, especially my oldest, was being coached and had many inappropriate conversations with their mom about the divorce. You'd think the court would take action, but nothing came from it. My time with the kids at this point never changed over the year. \n\nIn March of this year our case was handed over to a social worker. Her role was to investigate and report back to the court her findings and recommendations. With just our first meeting, I could tell that she could see through my ex and her games, but I wasn't 100% sure. She revealed new allegations of bruising on my oldest child seen by her therapist and her school psychologist. In most states, the two individuals I just mentioned are mandatory reporters. If they see anything or suspect abuse, they're required by law to report it to Child Protective Services(CPS). She asked me if I was ever investigated by CPS and I said I wasn't. I was intrigued... if she's willing to lie to an officer of the court, then she'd be willing to lie to CPS. Later that week I had my kids and when I dropped them off I told her she's wreckless to bring in my childs therapist and school official into the divorce. That next Monday she filed a report of abuse to CPS and then a week later she filed another. After requesting and receiving all CPS reports going back 2 years, I realized that the second report she filed in 2 weeks, she also went to the police station to \"get advice\". \nSince all the revelations starting back in March, the focus has shifted from me to her. Legally I'm still behind the eight ball  because all the damage that the initial allegations created, but it's moving positively in my direction. \n\nI'd like to make a personal appeal to anyone going through a divorce or might ever go through divorce. I know the tension will run high, money runs short, and the need to win is desirable. If you have kids, love them more than you hate your spouse. \nHave a good day. ",

Luckily she isn't there most of the time, since she generally stays in New Jersey through the spring and summer; but it's still humiliating and depressing that on top of still being unemployed he now has to live with his mother to avoid going homeless.

To the point where I had broken up a physical altercation between the two of them when they were both in their 30's.  When the sister made accusations of abuse against her husband and got divorced the family started paying a lot of attention to her (I knew her husband and have a very hard time believing the \"abuse\", he had custody of his child from a previous marriage).  2 months later my Ex stopped talking to me for almost 30 days.  When I had enough, I informed her that I was going to get a hotel room for a couple of days so we could both cool off.  I came back on Monday Morning to a house with all my personal things piled on my side of the garage and the locks changed on the house.  Called the cops to see what I could do and the cop asked me if my name was on the deed and if I had tools.  I removed one of the locks from one of the doors because she wouldn't give me a key.\n\nShe did things like try to stop me from removing a family Heirloom from the property to return to my family as I knew I would be moving.  She stalled us out until time for my kids to come home from School (Kindergarten and 2 Grade) so the cops would be there, than she had the gaul to ask the cops if they would take her to the corner to pick up the kids so they could \"ride in a cop car\", they just looked at her like she was crazy.\n\nMy son at 7 years old called the cops on her once because she threw the dog at the entertainment center in their house and broke one of the doors on it.  Of course, she talked her way out of that.\n\nShe called me one evening when my 6 year old daughter and her had gotten in a fight and told me to come get her now.  She didn't let her take anything but the clothes on her back.\n\nShe spent around $100,000 trying to bankrupt me and throw me in jail.  She was partially successful, but I have a lot of friends (for some reason people like me, I'm not sure why).  She did everything she could to break up any personal relationships I had with friends and my family (again she was partially successful in this).\n\nShe called me a week after school got out at 10PM on a Saturday Night (I was broke and mopping my kitchen floor) and informed me that she was dropping my Son off for the summer and would be there in 10 Minutes.  It was one of the best Summers of my life.\n\nShe introduced her Step Daughters (Middle Schooler and High Schooler) to one of our mutual friends that she ran into as \"My Hairy Stepdaughters.\"\n\n3 months before I got remarried (to an absolute Angel) she convinced my Daughter to make false accusations of abuse against me (I guess she was trying to stop my wedding).  Went through all the investigations including my son being interviewed and came out clean on the other side (whew, dodged a bullet there).  I haven't seen my daughter since (almost 10 years now).\n\nShe was so abusive to my son over the years that he developed some pretty serious mental issues and has been in and out of hospitals for the last 6, almost 7 years.\n\nNot to mention that my son came to live with me at 14 and I still had to pay $500/month in Child Support even though her family is worth Millions.  She drove around in a New Lexus and owned two houses (one of which I signed over to her in the divorce), while my son and I lived in a 2 bedroom hole (but we were happy).\n\nThis is only a small highlight reel, there were worse things and more stories than I can list here.  All told, I figure the divorce cost me roughly $250,000 over the course of about 6 or 7 years.  I'm just a working stiff and that is a lot of money to me.\n\nOn the upside, I somehow convinced the most Wonderful Woman in the World to marry me.  I still have my son in my life.  I have 2 beautiful Grand Children from my Wife's Daughter that I get to spend at least 1 day every week with.  I consider myself to be very lucky indeed.",

After the economy got fucky, my dad, who owned his own business, could no longer afford my mom's extravagant shopping bills. Instead of having a talk like a normal person, he decided to stop paying the mortgage. The house was foreclosed upon years later without my mother's knowledge. Her credit was destroyed because her name was on the lease. \n\nIt was about this time that my dad removed all the money from their shared bank account, leaving $135. He said, \"That should be enough for the two of you for a couple months.\"\n\nMy mom sold her wedding ring at a pawn shop so we could have Christmas and I wouldn't know anything was wrong. My parents got divorced, my dad took her to court for everything but in the end it ended up being a pretty fair divorce agreement. We were allowed to live in the house for two years before we had to leave.\n\nMy mom overstayed that by about a year, in an attempt to get me to finish middle school. That was when my dad broke into the house, stole stuff from us, changed the locks on the doors, and shut us out. We spent most of the night in the police station before they kicked my dad back out of the house and we walked in to find most of our things missing.\n\nWe went back to court and the judge told us we had until August 30th to move out (about a month). On the 20th, while I was sitting home alone (my mom was at work), my dad broke into the house and I hid under the bed as he ransacked the place. He found things that were rightfully ours, that we were planning to sell to afford a new place, and took them.\n\nSo, yeah. Not great.",

    "body": "This is a personal one for me, but both my parents pretty much suck through and through. This is pretty long, so tl;dr at the end. \n\nParents divorced when I was three. Dad was an abusive alcoholic executive in the transportation industry (read: he has money-important later), mom was hiding bipolar and narcissistic personality disorder and hadn't held job since high school. Dad remarries right after finalization and had gotten stepmom pregnant before divorce was even final. My siblings and I move-mom has custody of us. Dad gets the summer and winter breaks. All is amicable for a while, especially after dad gives up the bottle and finds Jesus. \n\nMom is abusive as fuck to us throughout our childhood. Anything not bolted down is likely able to be used to beat us with. During family gatherings, my mom and my aunts and uncles would tell these stories about hitting their kids too like they're all trying to one-up each other. They were raised on this shit as it's the only way my grandma knew how to parent-spare the rod and spoil the child type shit, and they carried on the tradition.\n\nAfter 9/11, when I was 13, mom and dad became more genial towards each other. We got more visits and trips to see dad. It was a good time, until the summer just before I started high school. My brother and I were grounded. Mom took little sister shopping and he and I snuck out and went skateboarding. We got back just as my mom was pulling up. She chased us inside the house and beat the shit out of us with our boards, or tried to, at least. My older sister came over a couple days later and saw the bruises on us and told dad secretly. A week later at the skatepark, a friend runs up to me and hands me her cell phone-my mom is on the line and tells me to come home because \"your father is starting shit again\". I ride up and there are four county sheriff squad cars outside the house, with the whole neighborhood looking on. A deputy tells me to pack a bag for the weekend because dad is here to take us. \n\nMe and my siblings get in three separate squad cars and drive a couple blocks away to a church parking lot where my dad is waiting inside a limo with my older sister and her fianc\u00e9. He gets out and runs up to hug me and is obviously fake crying and apologizing. I have no clue wtf is going on at this point.\n\nFast forward six months-parents are engaged in an epic custody battle. Three times a week, my siblings and I have to go to counseling, therapy, and meet with our guardian ad litem (GAL), along with weekend plane trips back and forth to dad's state from our state-900 miles away. Like I said, dad had money. We were all still in school, too-6th, 8th, and 9th grade. The judge was getting sick of the back and forth, so he ordered my dad to move into our house and my mom had to move out because she wasn't allowed to live with us alone-we had an uncle living with us 24/7 up until then. The judge wanted to see if he could handle raising kids on his own. Bad move-my little sister was taking things the hardest. She and dad would get into spats daily, and one night, they went at it really badly and they were on the verge of a fistfight. The next day, he takes her to a psych ward at a hospital and has her committed. Judge finds out, and ends the experiment.\n\nI guess after that, it wasn't going too well on my dad's side. He was getting sick of the court proceedings dragging on, so in the end, he decided to pay off our counselor and therapist over $15k each to sway their statements to the court in his favor to earn custody. My moms lawyers discovered it while going through financial statements. Dad loses. Mom wins, but is ordered to never lay a finger on us and if she does, we call our GAL and she loses us. \n\nMy siblings and I still lost in the end, because instead of using physical violence, she just used psychological and mental abuse until one by one, we all moved the fuck out of her house when we turned 18. I haven't spoken to her in nearly ten years and don't plan to. Dad tries to come back in every once and a while, but he doesn't give a shit about his kids from his first marriage, which was painfully obvious then and now. \n\n**Edited to add TL;DR:** parents divorce, mom is abusive, dad is nonexistent. Mom goes overboard one day and is snitched on by my older sister. My siblings and I get put through hell for almost a year of our young lives, being shuttled back and forth from two states. Dad pays off court-appointed mental health professionals, gets caught, loses. Nothing changes for us kids until we can move out and cut contact from our parents.\n\n ",

In my state, both parents have full rights to the children unless a custody order in place. In other words, whoever has the kid, gets the kid. Police will not intervene where one spouse is withholding a child from the other spouse if there are no orders in place.\n\nWell my client had the child for two weeks at her new place when H showed up demanding the child. She refused. He called the police. The responding officer was a family friend of both, but originally a friend of H. This PO shows up and decides to try to mediate the conflict. The PO tells my client something along the lines of \"let him hug his son goodbye and he will leave peacefully.\" My client was hesitant, but agreed. H took the kid and exclaimed \"he's mine now!\" And ran to his car with the baby. No supplies, no clothes, nothing. The PO claimed he had no idea what was happening (yeah right). And since no orders were in place, there was nothing my client could do.\n\nWhile we were trying to track him down, we got an order returning the child to my client's possession. He suddenly contacted my client saying he was at a hotel in the area and if she wanted her son back, she  could if she came over and slept with him. We sent the police.",

We used to get frequent calls from a married couple who jointly owned an investment and were split up, living at different residences. The husband would change the address on the account to his home address, then the wife would call a few days later to change it to hers. We were always being berated by them for following the other spouse' orders, even though - as we would explain - both were authorized to do so. The rub was that the contract (which was infinitesimally small) couldn't be withdrawn without both parties authorizing it and the check had to be made out to both of them. Knowing this, they just kept this pissing match up for years. \n\nWe also had a customer who was a doctor (a specialist who I'm sure earned a shitload) in his late 70's who owned an annuity worth maybe $500k. He was divorcing his wife. He would call in every few months to ensure his wife couldn't get his money before the divorce. We were constantly explaining that he was the only person who could authorize a withdrawal, and that the check would have to be in his name, but that it was technically an asset and was fair game in a divorce settlement. \n \nHis wife was his sole beneficiary and was also in her 70's. Every time he called he would go in to a tirade about how he worked for the money, not his wife, and she didn't deserve any of it. It sounded like he had been the sole breadwinner and was perfectly fine leaving his 70+ aged wife to figure out how to earn income. He was also not terribly lucid and always had a new financial advisor on the phone when he called, so I imagined he was somewhat senile.

Wife owns a small shop in the local community (a pet pastime - doesn't really turn a profit).  Been trying to get pregnant for a couple of years - working with reproductive doctors / clinic.  Wife finally gets pregnant - one in a million chance.  Has the baby - its a boy!  Fast forward a couple of months.  Wife has to go to market for her shop and takes a day trip to \"the big city\" a couple of hours away.  Husband prepared for this and takes opportunity to have baby tested for paternity - not his.  When they started fertility clinic, he was tested and knew he was shooting blanks.  \n\nSo, he contacts his attorney (my \"boss\") and we start \"the plan\".  While we are preparing the case, we have PI follow wife.  A few doctor visits, tennis lessons, lunch at the country club daily, hanging out with her friends.  Her friends decide to throw her a birthday party at the Country Club.  This is our opportunity.  \n\nI serve her the divorce papers, loudly asking her name and, after confirming,  announce the reason for the divorce - infidelity. You are hereby ordered to appear, in the {blank} county court, blah blah blah... Her friends are stunned.  Discovery reveals that she and her friends are all cheating in the same circles.  Go to court - present evidence showing husband is not father and request to have his name removed from birth certificate.  Judge, not wanting the child to become a ward of the state orders her to produce a list of all people she has slept with during the reasonable window of conception.  She provides list.  Next court appearance, ten men show up running the full gamut of \"personalities\".  One doctor, one architect, a tennis coach, two chefs, one \"trust fund prince\", and a few others to \"round out the mix\".  One was actually the father of the person they really needed, but when she said, \"John Doe\", she didn't specify \"John Doe Jr\".  All ordered to take a dna test.  Our client succeeds in getting his name removed from birth certificate, no child support, no alimony.  Wife strikes a deal with baby daddy for child support and \"support payments\" for a number of years - she \"wins\", it's the doctor.  Part of agreement is she has to move from area (paid by Dr.), NDA signed, Doctor VERY rich and must protect his name / reputation.  Court allowed no dad on birth certificate because of guaranteed support for child (trust fund).\n\nYea client.  It sucked for him keeping everything secret, but he a smart and patient man.  He has since remarried and is very happy.  Because of evidence produced, several other high profile (but low key) divorces followed.",

A few months in things become fucky, tho. She would deny him the visits for weeks for blatant reasons and started claiming he wouldn't pay any aliments, even though he very well did and wanted to see the kids.\n\nWent on for almost a year until he got fed up as she wouldn't care about his complaints and continued to get him in trouble with the authorities for claiming nonesense and so he finally threatened with a lawsuit, unless she would get her shit together.\n\nInstead, she immediatly filed her own and wanted to have the full custody and him not visiting the kids at all. As reason for why he is unsuited to see or have the kids she stated things like; being an atheist, being a football fan (european), liking beer, hating and forbidding christmas (he does celebrate it, just not for religious reasons), among more bs. \n\nHe is by no mean a rich man or an angel but a hardworking geriatric nurse and a very dear friend to me, while she just tried to live comfortably of someone elses money and put her interests above everyone, even her kids. The way court day went down, he told me, was just pure bliss. The judge saw how ridiculous and crooked her claims were and simply destroyed them with all the evidence speaking against them.\n\nIn the end, they will have another hearing in half a year where the full custody will be decided. Until then, tho, he will continue to visit twice a week and actually file a report on *her* behaviour, after each visit, that will be then surveyed in the next court day for custody.

My dad can be a real asshole but he NEVER did anything like that to us. \n\nDad was so distraught he got violently ill even talking about it.

Just to stay out of my friends' personal lives.\n\nFortunately, I found out later that my sister's ob/gyn fudged the paper work and just said she did the exam (she didn't), but she knew my niece was a happy child and never harmed in such a way. She even volunteered to speak for my dad to CPS.\n\nCase was dropped due to lack of evidence. I told the social worker they were chasing nothing and they weren't hearing it. I even told them I know who filed the report and they were doing it out of spite to get back at me but they didn't care. \n\nedit: worst part is, ex bestie was in college aiming to be a social worker.

We were home within a few months of getting a new judge. \n\n\nMy mother was in her mid 20s dealing with this. She is the epitome of strength.

So after two years of paying what he had to ($2k/mo) we have a 15 year old. He is now paying $600/mo more than he needs to for 36 months (36\\*$600 = $21,600). 5 years later the last child is 13 and 11 months. So 4 years  and 1 month of paying $1300 more per month is (49*$1300) = $63,700. For a grand total of $85,300 more than necessary.  \n\nThe maximum he overpaid is assuming the 16 yo is 16 and 11 mo and the others are exactly 13 and 11 mo and 8. After 13 months of paying the appropriate $2k/mo we have a 15 yo child and a 9 and 1 mo child. So he overpays $600/mo for 3 years ($21,600). Then the remaining 5 years and 11 mo he overpays by $1300/mo ($92,300) for a total of $113,900 overpaid. \n\nSo this man overpaid between $85.3k and $113.9k over 10 years (really 7-8 years since for 13-24 months he was paying appropriately). \n\nEdit.

    "body": "My mother did something similar. I think you might have been confused on the scam your mom was trying to run.\n\nWhen the court is looking at assets and splitting them, they will take into account the current assets and each party can argue for why they should get some things over others. A big part of that is who the property was originally bought for.\n\nIn my parents case, my mother listed all of the assets she could think of an overvalued them. 10 year old stereo system? The value was listed as the price it was originally purchased for. \n\nOne thing she did was value the antiques they owned as far over what they were actually worth. I only found that out because I had the antiques appraised for my father, and I coincidentally went to the same appraiser my mother had gone to. \n\nAnyways, what you try and do is create as much on paper value for the property as you can, and then argue that you shouldn't get any of the property (or should only get the liquid property). This creates a huge imbalance because one person takes on property that is extremely overvalued and not liquid but on paper it will look like a 50% split.\n\nFor example, husband bets $100k in assets (antiques, etc) actually worth $25k, wife gets $100k in cash. \n\nHow this is allowed to happen, I don't know, but it does.\n\nThe judge in my parents case went further. There was real estate that needed to be divided up. The judge gave my father one piece of real estate on which the market value was much less than the one he gave my mom. The judge justified it by saying that he used potential market value in the future to make it equitable.\n\nThat is, my mom got the property worth $1mil today, and my dad got one worth $500k - and the judge called it fair because according to him the $500k property could be worth $1mil in the future.\n\nMy dad appealed that all the way to the Supreme Court and it was overturned, you can't just make up a future value, you have to use current market value.\n\nWhat's even crazier is that judge can impute income on people to support the alimony they are ordered to pay. Presumably this is to prevent people from stopping working to get out of paying alimony. The problem is that it can be abused easily by bad judges.\n\nMy dad made the vast majority of his money from a lawsuit his company was involved in. It was a single, one time multi-million dollar distribution he received.\n\nThe judge used all of the money he made + what he made in that lawsuit to determine what his income was for the purposes of alimony.\n\nMy dad was making about $100k a year from his salary and distribution from investments. \n\nThe judge imputed $400k a year income for the purposes of alimony, which meant my dad was paying literally every dollar he made to my mom in alimony.\n\nYou are only allowed to dispute that number after a year, and only once a year. \n\nAfter the original judges order was overturned by the supreme court, my dad got a much more reasonable judge who was actually going to try and make an equitable decision. My mother saw the writing on the wall, and together with my dad we offered her a bunch of money as a settlement because she had already sapped 5 years of our lives litigating the divorce and putting our dad through hell. She took the settlement and my dad is now free of any obligations to her. \n\nEdit:\n\nI forgot to mention that the judge also gave my dad all of the debt and my mother none of it. Debt that he took on while they were married to start the company that eventually allowed him to make all of the money to buy all of the stuff my mom ended up getting in the settlement. \n\nThere are a myriad of ways judges can screw people while keeping it \"equitable\" on paper.

They were well off, however her dad made a series of life decisions that easily cost them over half their wealth (had a house built right before the recession, tried selling their old one after the recession hit, then moved out of their new house within 3 years and took another massive hit on that).  He was also let go from the job he had and was unable to keep any new jobs as he was suffering from mental issues.\n\nIt was basically each other's goal to leave the other side with nothing and so what little resources they had ended up sunk in legal costs.  While her dad definitely did things out of spite, considering less than 5 years later he's in a home with dementia and doesn't remember anyone, I'm a little more sympathetic to him since who can really say how much the mental issues were affecting him during the divorce.  Her mom though was straight up spiteful for the sake of spite.  When her dad tried collecting disability because of OCD she fought him the whole way.  When he filled out the financial disclosures she dumped thousands of dollars trying to allege he had offshore bank accounts.\n\nThe real victim here is my wife.  The process definitely exacerbated and accelerated her dad's mental decline.  Her mom came out the winner I guess you'd say, but after all the bills were paid, she has less than probably 25% of what they started out with when they initiated the divorce proceedings.  She now lives with us in an in-law suit, living off disability and unable to touch any of the money she won in the divorce because it counts as income against the government assistance she gets for having MS.  Both her parents lost the last somewhat functional years of their lives consumed by just fighting each other in the divorce. ",

A year goes by with ex barely bothering to see our daughter, blaming me for this even though I always made her available within 24 hours of being asked to. \n\nStart of court case one, ex decides to accuse me of abuse and domestic violence, this is eventually thrown out and I agree to ex seeing my daughter once a week via contact centre to move onto overnights once she was 6 months clean and healthy. I was granted residence and primary care, this case lasted a year. \n\n6 month later ex has new partner and is clean, mentally doing better and decides to go for full custody, after over a year of my name being dragged through the mud and allegations of abuse and neglect to my daughter etc, we reach an agreement to have almost shared care (2 nights a week to the ex) I was again granted residence and primary care, this case with a bit over a year. \n\nAnother 9 months go by and ex decides to go for custody again, but this time accuses me of sexual behaviour and molestation of my daughter. Luckily, since there had been 2 cases before this, there was a duty of proof required, and since it didn't happen, there was no proof. Went through a full hearing, very in depth with psychiatric reviews, drug tests, questioning people I spent time with, background checks to ensure everyone my daughter came into contact with was safe and above board, social services intervening all along the way, my stress levels through the roof all this time for the case to finally end with the same despising as before, 2 nights with ex, residence with me.\n\nWe finished court 6 months ago and since then and the ex has breached the order multiple times, refusal to return my daughter after contact on at least 15 occasions (over 6 month period!) not to mention not returning clothes / sending her home in small clothes and generally talking to me like I'm a piece of garbage and refuses to accept that I am the resident parent. \n\nAnd people womlnder why I have a fear of the opposite sex and being in a relationship. This near bankrupt me, destroyed all my savings, cost me my career, has caused long term stress and anxiety and ruined my social standing (ex told everyone about the things 'I did' that were all made up, and they believed some of them, I cut contact with those who even remotely believed it, but thlse lose friendships coupled with social services intervening when I met anyone new really made it difficult for me to let anyone into my life.)\n\nI'm now at a point in my life where I know court is over, I know my ex will always be more than a little difficult with me and yet I still have to see her every fortnight for handovers and cannot move on with my life for fear of losing my daughter. \n\nI actually feel better for venting all this, even though it'll probably get buried. \n\nTldr: 3 court cases, escalating allegations from domestic abuse, to child neglect, to child molestation plus allegations for drug use, still won custody of my daughter but at a huge cost to my physical and mental health and friendships.

Sometimes, if it's a potential client that I could tolerate, but I know they'll be in a pain in the ass, I'll try to price them out. I'll quote them an initial retainer at least double what I would normally quote someone. I've had one or two bite on that, so they called my bluff and I ended up representing them. ",

Many hate to hear it, but men have an uphill climb in these antiquated/bias family court systems from the start. You have to work harder to get a fair shot.\n\nConcerning the kids being distant, they will come around. Kids are smarter than we give them credit for. The spoiling with toys, sabotage attempts from the ex, all leading to the horrible feeling that you are being erased from your child's lives...that will all be relatively short-lived. I. Fucking. Promise.\n\n**Edit**: I will add a little anecdote as I want fathers in particular to be aware of this:\n\nI had achieved primary physical custody. It went fairly smoothly  for many years. All visitation with the mother we basically handled out of court, as I had no interest in dealing with it anymore. My child lived with me. With holidays, it's customary to rotate. Well, one Christmas my kid's mom went nuts about the visitation agreement we had set. Some words were said, nothing threatening or too incredibly insulting. As soon as Jan 2nd came, she went and filed a Protection From Abuse order against me (including our child in the document). Now, remember, this is a woman who was deemed unfit to raise children by a court.\n\nOnce the next visitation rolled around I suppose the paperwork was still in the mail. I had no idea at the time. Well, she kept the kid. And she did it legally for 2 months. I was not permitted anywhere near the kid until a judge heard the case and decided she basically created the scenario in her head, then abused the system to score a momentary win against me. But, for a time, that \"loophole\" gave an unfit mother her child back--just like that.\n\nBeware of things like this. They only need to make the claim. No evidence is required. This tactic is fairly common and a lot of women are aware of it. Even if something like this happens to you, remain calm, continue with your notes. You are in this for the long haul.\n\nYeah, I think some reforms are necessary.",

She conceded, and asked to have it to herself for a weekend instead, just to move her stuff out and have some time to herself before she'd move out temporarily. The exes agree, and that weekend the ex-gf proceeds to enjoy some bottles of wine, some seafood- and then stuffs the curtain rods with every leftover she has, plus her ex's favourite treat: caviar (she left a can of the stuff in the fridge). Afterwards, the exes move in and proceed to make it their little love-pad, but it doesn't take long for them to realize something's amiss (although it takes them a while to realize it's the stench that's steadily growing stronger), and from there on cracks start appearing in their relationship, etc etc- in the end, the ex-bf gets back in contact with the scorned ex-gf, and he sells her the much coveted appartment for a fraction of the original price (bonus: he had the whole place renovated in an attempt to find the source of the smell, so she got an awesome deal out of it). He couldn't figure out why she kept cracking up when she came to pick up the keys, nor her preoccupation with the curtain rods (he had put new ones in for the sale) ",

Plus, having the credentials of being a former US Olympic Head Mechanic helps. \n\nNow since he is well-known in the cycling world, he's gotten in contact with some local pros and one hooked him up with an account with Focus bikes.

If you read any book on the Enron scandal what always comes through is how much the Enron guys believed their own bullshit and how disorganised and incompetent the Enron staff became after Rich Kinder (one half of Kinder Morgan) left the company in 1996.  McLean and Elkind's book (that the documentary *The Smartest Guys in the Room* is based on) makes this point:\n\n>When, exactly, did Enron cross the line? Even now, after all the congressional hearings, all the investigative journalism, all the reports, lawsuits, and indictments, that\u2019s an impossible question to answer. There have been accounting frauds over the years where companies created receivables out of whole cloth or shipped bricks at the end of a quarter instead of products. In such cases, someone at a company has to consciously consider the fact that he or she is about to commit a crime\u2014and then commit it.\n\n>But for the most part, the Enron scandal wasn\u2019t like that. The Enron scandal grew out of a steady accumulation of habits and values and actions that began years before and finally spiraled out of control. When Enron expanded the use of mark-to-market accounting to all sorts of transactions\u2014was that when it first crossed the line? How about when it set up its first off-balance-sheet partnerships, Cactus and JEDI, with such reputable investors as General Electric and CalPERS? Or when it categorized certain unusual gains as recurring? Or when it created EPP, that \u201cindependent\u201d company to which Enron sold stakes in its international assets and posted the resulting gains to its bottom line?\n\nSet against this background, it seems equally plausible that Pai saw the crash coming or that he simply had a little more dumb luck than the rest of the Enron C-suite.",

I told myself, \"Well, this is probably as good as it will get, and at least she has a nice body!\"\n\nMy parents told me I could do better, and they were worried about me. My self esteem was so low I ignored it. Her father was obviously abusive, and her entire extended family gave of a \"hills have eyes\" vibe. \n\nIt wasn't until I went to thanksgiving with her mother and her to see her extended family that I realized I was making a mistake. \n\nAll the \"family blood\" sat at one table, and all the married in folks sat at another. I got to talk to a good 8 people who married into my ex's family. They opened my eyes with comments like, \"Well you get used to the way they are\" and \"Sometimes I just need to go on a drive when my husband gets in that mood\" (followed by nods from around the table, worst part was I knew that mood. It wasn't abusive or anything, it was rejective. She wasn't the most cultured, and I thought I could change that. However if an idea was brought up and she didn't like it, full shut down, like a child. \n\nWhen we got back I realized I was engaged to her, and I couldn't marry her. I was seeing everything I would be settling with, and it wasn't a life I wanted. She would never leave the small city she lived in, never accept the times changing. I realized how much work and effort I put into the relationship. How big of a mistake I was making.\n\nLuckily I was given an out, a job took me 150 miles away. I knew she wouldn't come with me, and I knew I couldn't explain why I didn't love her. So I used it as an excuse, told her I had plans to move to California again as soon as I could. She understood we were just too different and we had a decently clean break. \n\n\nI think I had a good 3 years before I was in another relationship.
