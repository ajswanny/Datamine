I have done small gestures like this in the past, like driving around passing away free milkshakes with friends to strangers on the street. Even topped it off with whip cream. \n\nAlso did a free car wash, although I just mass texted everyone in my phone to come to my house if they wanted a free car wash. Ended washing about 20 with a help of another friend, and most people didn't have time to wait around all day.\n\nI looked into the balloon thing. I wanted to do it in LA, but after Emailing with a city council member, she stated that there were various concerns that I needed to consider. Stuff like the shortage on helium at the time, the inevitable mass littering that would happen due to the balloons after they pop, and etc.\n\nStill I still try my best to do small project where I can do weird stuff like this. My latest one involves giving talented young local musicians the support that they don't often get. I dabbled alot in music when I was younger and many of my friends are talented videographers and such, so we put together small live sessions for them for recording and video. It's small but one thing that sucks about doing music is that you're alone most of the time, and having a group of people who invest into you, and support you is a great feeling.\n\nI didn't mean to toot my own horn, but I simply mean to say that we can all do something to make the days of people around us better!\n",

That service has gotten so popular that there's even one in the mall in my town, which is in the middle of nowhere in upstate NY.\n\nI've been to some of them, and the game design has always disappointed me. I love game design and I would love to do design experiences for escape/puzzle rooms full-time.\n\nBut I also have a lot of ideas on how to improve the business side of things. I don't know why, but none of the escape rooms I've been to provide any sort of discount for larger groups, which doesn't seem fair. When each person is shelling out $20+, you might as well give a group rate if they have 5 or more people. Especially considering that the puzzles aren't well designed for groups of people.",

The medium wouldn't really matter, provided that people who were interested had easy (and free) access to it.\n\nThis is all hard for some folks to believe, of course, but honestly: I *don't* want that gold-plated walrus.\n\n**TL;DR: I actively** ***want*** **to offer free entertainment.**",

Then he sold Carrie after getting a bunch of stories rejected, for $400,000.\n\nThe best advice he gives is also part of a video between him and George RR Martin. He says something like he writes every day for a couple hours, even if it's shit (which explains a lot of his stories), even if he has nothing to write.

    "body": "This will probably be buried, but my husband is a blacksmith. Certified in June, working a summer job, and hopes to set up his own smithy going forward, but aware that he might have to take another job just for the income in the meantime.\n\nWorth noting that I am and will likely remain the primary breadwinner in our household, but I am okay with that; he's truly happy doing this, and this is priceless to me after him (and consequently us) going through some *really* tough times before he found this program.\n\nHere's a longer post I wrote a while back in response to someone asking a while back what a blacksmith even does nowadays, because I think a lot of people think all they do (did) is make swords and horseshoes.\n\n> Disclaimer: we live in Estonia, where, despite the craft's niche status, demand remains high enough that we will have to choose what part of the country to live in according to where the local market isn't already saturated with established masters and ultra-competitive.\n\n>  Blacksmiths can make a wide variety of stuff, ranging from gates and railings to light fixtures, tools, farming equipment, utensils, shelving brackets, fire pokers (wood heating remains incredibly common here), coat hooks, door and cabinet handles, etc. Mass-produced and steel-cut versions of stuff he can make are no doubt tons cheaper at the store, but as a blacksmith, especially an experienced one, your customers aren't people who would buy that junk anyway. He generally prices by hours of work put into an item, each of which is handmade. This stuff isn't just for rich people or reenactment folks either; it's used and highly regarded by everyday people.\n\n> He's currently working a summer gig in a castle yard that is a tourist hotspot, where they use old-fashioned tools and all that. Unfortunately that means he has to waste a lot of time making cheap doodads like hooks and nails which they can buy as souvenirs for a couple of euro apiece, but he has time to fulfill little orders too, like [an herb-chopper](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HcTcFbxtiLU/maxresdefault.jpg) (photo is illustrative). The other day he made a two-handled one with wooden handles for 170\u20ac.\n\n> While still in trade school this spring, between various final projects, he found time to experiment with making [damascus steel bottle openers](http://i.imgur.com/UWPDwhA.jpg) (his work/my photo), the top one of which was a gift which he said he would have priced at about 80\u20ac and the bottom of which, made from scrap nails and which he said he would have sold for 30\u20ac, was for a friend in trade for the latter helping us move a bunch of stuff to another town with his truck and trailer. Sometime over the winter he was asked to make an iron spoon as an alternative to the traditional silver spoon given as a christening gift. He made a [bunch of different spoons](http://i.imgur.com/PMLWVvR.jpg) (his work/my photo) so the person could pick their favorite. I think he sold them all for 25\u20ac each. One of his earliest blades was what is known here as a traditional women's knife, to be worn at the belt, and he gave it to me; I use it as a letter opener. :)\n\n> These all sound like terribly small sums of money and no they won't get you a steady salary (that's why I'll likely remain the primary breadwinner and I'm okay with that), but minimum wage is 420\u20ac/month and avg. salary is around 1,200\u20ac/month gross here anyway, so he might as well do something he loves. Maybe I can help him sell his stuff on Etsy too; the world is your oyster these days. Anyway, hopefully in a couple decades he'll be a known name across the country like those under whom he has learned and interned. The hope is that he can do this for a living. Maybe not right away, but once he's gained more experience and built up his name.\n\n> We're looking into buying a small farm within the next year, as I work from home and he could set up a workshop in one of the spare buildings. We're going to look at a place soon, actually!\n\n> Also, he's never made a horseshoe and has said he never plans to. Too many others have that niche covered.\n\n> edit: [Skarabeus](http://i.imgur.com/n17SVwr.jpg), steel and copper with LED strip. Final project. Excuse the flooring.",

I stop and do other things. \n\nAnd it's not like I get board of the game either, I have a good income, no debts so I could spend whatever I want buying games off steam... but it just gets tiresome and tedious after a while.\n\nHaving said that, if I have the time and there's nothing else to do, I come home from work and happily play video games till pretty late on week nights. \n\nFor me I think it's about balance, work is hectic and stressful, so coming home and just playing video games is a great stress relief. But if I have no stress in the day (biggest decision of the day is what to eat for lunch) playing vids all day loses it's luster after a while.  ",

    "body": "Really basic stuff. My first project was a set of cutting boards, simple and easy to make with the tools on hand. I have a Craigslist shop which I've invested about $1000 into, with a table saw, lathe, and drill press all found at good prices online. I bought a basic workbench and a planer on sale at Harbor Freight. Quite a few tools are hand-me-downs from my parents, all my clamps are from Craigslist. The nicest tool I own is a Stanley Sweetheart #4 plane which was a Christmas gift from my family. Everything else is cheap, cheap, cheap - but it does the job. My short-term project plans include a basic dust collector, a marking gauge, and table saw sleds. \n\nMy journey started by discovering Matthias Wandel on YouTube four or five years ago. I religiously watched every single video he ever produced for years before I ever even set my hands on a tool. I then had the free time during my senior year at college to sign up for woodworking classes, and my professor, with whom I am still acquainted, is an amazing guy who constantly encourages me to make, make, make.

Chicken wire staked with small stakes or sticks woven through does the trick for me, but have to make sure you pin down the bottom against the ground or they will nuzzle underneath.  I've also found that the way rabbits patrol their territories dictates what they hit and what they leave alone.  They follow perimeters oftentimes, and will continue to hit the same plants because they are on their pathways.  Don't plant your tasty plants on these perimeter paths.  Plant things like marigolds and garlic that they won't bother.  Plant your tasty plants elsewhere.  Also give them something else to eat.  They love clover, so don't spray your yard for weeds, and then they will have something they like even more than your crops. ",

Being only one of these requires an exceptional degree of ability in that skill; if you aren't *the* top player you had better be fun to watch, and you don't have to be a particularly good player if you can make people laugh until their sides ache.\n\nThe main exception to this is probably the informative types, people who are highly knowledgable and impart that knowledge every chance they get. The most prominently popular example of this would be Day[9], but there do exist other mildly popular personalities that have a more informative style (usually specific to one or two games).\n\nYou might get some views for being literally the worst, but it likely won't keep your numbers up without something else to keep people around.

Effort To Switch and Things Available to Switch to. I'm sure it's an economic theory somewhere with fancier words, seems intuitive enough that it should be at least\n\nIn YouTube you have billions of other options, that can be accessed in seconds. So Effort is low and Availability is high, making it no big deal to just 'leave'.\n\nHowever let's image something bigger like Youtube itself. How many other options are there? Vimeo? Facebook? Snapchat? If you want an online subscription community with video you are somewhat limited maybe a few hundred sites depending on how lenient you are. And it's a lot of effort to find those new sites and learn to use them. So medium effort and medium availability. When people say to just leave Youtube when it implements bad features, is not as useful an argument here, it's a bit more desirable to get the community to change, rather than changing communities.\n\nNow imagine regarding a country. How many options are there really? Maybe a couple dozen that you could want, so really low Availability. And the effort is super high, learning a new language, getting a new house, new job, leaving behind or moving your family, etc. In this situation the argument \"just leave\" is pretty dumb. If you disagree with a few parts of the area you live in and say something like \"We should have better healthcare like other countries\" and the response is \"Just go live there\", that's dumb because you aren't just changing the healthcare you are changing everything.\n\n**Edit**: I'm rewriting and rethinking this comment like 4 times lol, it's an interesting concept. *The Influence of Availability and Effort in the Decision to Change or Leave a Community*. Too bad I'm not in college anymore to write a paper about it :p",
