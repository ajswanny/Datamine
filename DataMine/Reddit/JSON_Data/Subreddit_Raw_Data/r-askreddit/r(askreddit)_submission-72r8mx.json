I was once sat in maths class next to my friend and neither of us were paying attention so when the teacher asked my friend a question he just froze up and you could plainly see the \"oh shit\" face he was making.\n\n\nMe being the kind, quick thinking friend that I am, I quickly leaned over and whispered \"7\" into his ear. He just kind of reclined back a bit and in the most confident tone possible he just repeated my answer. The teacher pulled a confused expression and asked \"7 what?\".At this point, I burst out laughing.\n\n\nTo this day I still have no idea what the question was.",

My ex naturally did both of those things and Jimmy responded to him cracking jokes on his expense that of course ended with something about his mother. \n\nMeanwhile I was sitting next to him the whole show sweating bullets just praying to god that he doesn't include me any of the conversations because I would have died from embarrassment. \n\nEdit: Jimmy was amazing though.

My mother in law has a loose butthole from what I hope is some sort of medical condition and not years of rough anal, so she has to carry 3 to 5 pairs of underwear in her purse at all times, because every sneeze or cough is a literal pants shitting risk. As far as I know she hardly ever makes it through a day without changing into at least one of them. \n\nShe has no idea I know this about her. \n\nEdit: I'm getting a few common questions here, I'll try to answer the ones I actually know the answers to. \n\n1. How do you know this Salad??\n\nGood question, my mother in law and I have a great relationship, she's a very nice lady, and that has nothing to do with this because my wife told me when we were dating and she was really drunk. They worked at the same office together for years, so they know somewhat more intimate details of each other's life than I would think normal. \n\n,2. Does she keep the poopy panties in her purse?\n\nI don't know her system on that, I can explain what I think my system might be if I were in her situation, though. I'd bring good ziplock bags, keep my spare panties in them, and then when I shit myself I'd put the used ones in the ziplock bag and bring them home to wash. Maybe double bag it? \n\n,3. Why doesn't she wear adult diapers?\n\nThat's something she sees as an old person thing and we all want to feel young, I guess. Sucks for her she has a *really* old person's butthole. I don't think she full on drops a deuce I think just a little bit comes out, enough that she has to wipe it and there might be some on her britches. \n\nFeel free to ask any more questions you may have. \n\nEdit 2 to answer a few more common questions.\n\n,4. Does she have IBS/Crohn's/other?\n\nI don't know. If she does, it's undiagnosed, the woman refuses to go to the doctor for anything. I do know that her daughter (my wife) has IBS. \n\n,5. Did she have a rough birth?\n\nAll her children were C-sections. So I would say yes but not rough on her cooter and/or Bhole. \n\nEdit 3: I've been asked about gateway salads for people who don't like salads, I recommend some variation on the steakhouse salad theme, which will have steak, chicken, or fish (it's usually salmon) in it. If you want to make your own, you can add more than one. When you take a bite of the meat, make sure you get the greens in there as well. \n\nEdit 4: in what I can only imagine as cosmic retribution for sharing my mother in laws darkest secrets on the web, I have officially sharted on myself after too much coffee.

Random things that have happened just this week: \n\nThe supervisor mentioned something about her foot hurting and I spun around in my swivel chair with my scalpel and was like \"I'm ready to amputate.\" and she's like \"No, no, I'll just kill myself it's fine.\" \n\nOne path came in and complained about needing to do something for CAP (path organization) but one of the other paths didn't because he got his license a few years before, he was grandfathered in and didn't need to do it. Anyway, the path is like \"That motherfucker doesn't need to do this. He skates by with everything. I'm going to make him fill out my eval instead of the PA because I can. I'M THE LAB DIRECTOR AND I CAN DO WHAT I WANT.\" He says this laughing, of course, because they're close friends. We bought this path a mug that said \"Because I'm a pathologist and I said so.\" The path he was talking about (the one I called dad) received a \"5% pathology, 95% internet\" mug. I actually introduced him to reddit so hopefully he doesn't see this. \n\nAlso like an hour ago I asked one of the paths [the lab director one] if he'd sign something for me and he said \"I think [supervisor] can sign it, I don't think I need to.\" and I just narrowed my eyes and said \"Do you think you're too good for me, [path] How dare you.\" and he just started laughing at me. \n\n\nWe're also on a first name basis with the paths, unlike with the clinical doctors who are all Dr. [Last Name] and will yell at you if you refer to them by their first name or just their last name. Like you need to say their title. Lucky me, I have very limited contact with them other than in passing or via email. \n\nEdit: \n\nI just ran into the path that complained in the first story coming out of the hallway with all the bathrooms and I just looked at him inquisitively and said \"I didn't think girls pooped?\" and he's like \"I'm going to tell on you to Pam (office manager/HR)\" and then ran off in the opposite direction of Pam's office. \n\nSecond edit:\n\nPath I mentioned in my first edit ordered some special stains (HSVI, HSVII and CMV for all my histos out there) before he left just now to check if a patient has herpes in their esophagus and I was like \"How old is she?\" and my supervisor was like \"Don't you start.\" and the path was like \"Old enough to get down.\" My supervisor was not as enthused as we were. Also my supervisor is like twice my age and is 5ish years older than the path so this was all extra hilarious. ",

He had decided to conduct a barracks walkthrough on his own at 2230 on Friday night. I can outside when I heard yelling. One of the guys was drunk as hell and the LT was just going on about how we were not supposed to be glorifying alcohol. I interceded and recommended that this was an inappropriate time for a barracks check and suggested we call the first sergeant or commander. That's when he started with the enlisted men are dogs crap. I was getting pissed, but trying to keep it together. I turned and shook my fist, he said, \"what are you going to do hit me? You can't fucking touch me.\"  Turns out I could.  Fortunately for me he went to the ER after the incident as his nose was bleeding, on top of that someone recorded the entire exchange. His BAC was not 0%.\n\nI got really fucking lucky. If the commander hadn't been prior service and pissed about the whole affair, if I hadn't gotten cross leveled to CJSOTF on that deployment, if he hadn't been drinking and gone to the ER, if no one had recorded it...
