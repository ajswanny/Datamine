    "body": "edit: My earliest memory (not related to NK) is from 1984. The following is an account from around 1984-1987.\n\nI remember propaganda cartoons on TV - from the 70s - that showed communists as animals. There was a series called \ub618\uc774\uc7a5\uad70 where there was a young boy who fought communists, who were shown as animals. I found some videos on YouTube, for example: https://youtu.be/PNxySc3L7-I?t=53m20s\n\nOn one hand we were taught that reunification should be the goal, and we sang a song titled \"Our Wish is Unification,\" but on the other hand, we were taught that communists were evil and they did horrible things, axe-murdering American soldiers at the Panmunjeom (a neutral meeting place), ~~slicing~~ tearing open the mouth of a young boy who shouted \"I don't like communists/the communist party\" (the kid is said to have died and there was a monument at his home town or something).\n\nThe north were said to be digging tunnels to surprise-attack the south, and if you went to the borders you could visit the tunnels yourself - that had luckily been discovered beforehand.\n\nPropaganda materials from the north could be found in the countryside (dropped from balloons? scattered by spies?) and if you found them and turned them in to your teacher, you could get pencils as a reward.\n\nThere were said to be undercover agents living among us, northern spies pretending to be from the south. If somebody didn't know the latest fads you'd ask them \"are you a spy?\" as a joke. We were taught to be suspicious of people who weren't aware of current events.",

But I imagine what the kids hear now is different than what we heard. (I'm in late 20s). What I remember is it being painted as a political problem and we were a country that was torn that should unite again someday. I remember we did see footage of what dire conditions North Koreans live through in class. \n\nIn middle school we had a student that was from North Korea that defected through China I don't remember having many specific conversations with her but the overall attitude was fascination for than anything. (\"Wow you're really from there??\") \n\nI think it's also important to note there were still many people whose grandparents were from the North. My grandpa, for example, was from the North and had a whole family there. He was down south on business when it all happened and never quite made his way back I suppose. He is no longer with us and he never found out what happened to his previous family. I'd imagine there's relatively few people left who are from the North and grew up there long enough to remember a lot or have family they remember back there now. ",

A lot of good responses here on the sociopolitical perspective, so I will share some personal anecdotes on how the KR institution educates its people on NK.\n\nWhen I was in elementary school, the teachings were mostly on pity toward the North Korean general population, especially the children. Every now and then we would be given assignments to write letters to our North Korean peers. I remember writing one, and all I could write about was how I'd like to send them some of my favorite snacks, because I was taught in school that they were impoverished and shut off from the rest of the world.\n\nWhen I was in highschool, we learned more about the exploits of the regime, and the importance of democracy. The teachings became more about appreciating what we have in South Korea and understanding the failed government in North Korea.\n\nWhen I was a soldier in the Korean Army (ROK Army), we were grilled day and night on the belligerent nature of the North Korean government, and how the Kim Dynasty is slaving the NK people. Our shooting targets are still cut outs of NK soldiers.\n\nIf you can tell, the nuance for pity and sympathy toward the general North Korean public is constant throughout. South Korea's institutional stance toward NK people still has a warm spot. Movies, TV shows, and other media portraying the sorrows of a divided people are still popular.\n\nTo sum up, we are taught to feel sympathy toward the NK people and hate the dictatorship. ",

SK is definitely the good guys, look how rich we are now compared to them, they lost the Cold War and it's only a matter of time until they collapse. \n\nEthno-nationalist doctrine: North Koreans are our own blood, and they are starving (see: arduous march), we gotta help them. New liberal president of SK, Kim Dae Joong initiates the Sunshine Policy to be kinder and friendlier to the North, and the future is bright for all Koreans. \n\nCompare that to today, where most everyone is either apathetic or hateful towards NK, or nostalgic of the old days (see: Moon Jae-In platform). Mostly apathetic, but them North Koreans are getting p close to getting ICBMs soooo... \n\nEdit: I wrote this in a hurry before my final exam began, so I regret not being able to provide more in-depth information in a less off-the-cuff tone. I would like to point out that these views are not mutually exclusive. Like all human behaviour, there is hypocrisy in the strongest of black-and-white opinions, and in a politically diverse yet ethnically homogeneous country like South Korea, there is always room for a little Column A, a little Column B, and a Column who-gives-a-fuck. \n",

NK caused the Korean War that cost the peninsula dearly, but global alliance headed by America saved SK. Despite the war, South Koreans who are naturally smart with superior work ethics (not what i think but was jist of what they taught) drove the economy to grow at a tremendous speed (miracle of Han river as Koreans call it), surprising the entire world while NK was still starving and forever looking for ways to attack SK. \n\nMeanwhile, we were also taugh NK and SK is one country, and that reunification is the dream of all Koreans, and that we should strive for reunification without really talking about the methods.... \n\nBut my parents era is completely different. I remeber my mom telling me (shes nearly 60) how she once thought North Koreans had crimson face like Dokebi (sort of korean ogre) with horns on their heads when she was little.

    "body": "Finally, a thread where I'm relevant; albeit being too late to the show. I guess Ill post to get my mind off of some things. Im on mobile so Ill just ignore all the punctuations. Forgive me.\n\nPrepare your collective bodies for a long ass story.\n\nI grew up in SK (Seoul, born and raised!), stayed in the country til I was 15, before moving out of the country.\n\n\nWhen I was in grade school, (this was almost throughout the 2000s), we were taught that our brothers up north were, indeed, brothers. It was Kim Jong Il that we were supposed to hate. This was, restrospectively, a reflection of our regime at the time; President Kim Dae Joong and President Roh Mu Hyeon (both are considered very liberal. Only liberal presidents we've ever had, in fact. Both of whom I respect and admire greatly). \n\n***\nTangent time! Pres. Kim adopted the \"Sunlight Policy\", which was loosly based on one of Aesop's Fables; The North Wind and the Sun. He thought if we were to show kindness and graciousness towards the North, they would open up to us as the wanderer in the fable did. \n\nWe gave millions of tons of food and billions of Korean Won to NK, all of which sat ill with our elder demographic which was vastly conservative (fearing the \"Red\", accusing anyone liberal as being a Commie POS, the usual shtick).\n\nIt played out as planned. The North warmed up to us. We had trade! For the first time in decades! We had tourism as well for a select few!! All this was vehemently limited, what with tiny groups of tourists to the North (one of whom got lethally shot while HAVING A STROLL IN A RESTRICTED AREA IN THE CRAZIEST COUNTRY IN THE WORLD, but thats a story for another day), and one company from the North selling a few goods down South.\n\nBut we were getting somewhere. There was progress that was absent for half a century.\n\nThen everything changed when the ~~Fire Nation attacked~~ conservy AF presidents came into power and the North clammed right back up. Our current relations with NK is worse than ever, with frequent provocations and mortality amongst soldiers on both ends. Time to end the tangent.\n***\n\nWe were taught songs on Reunion. It went like: *Our wish is Reunion, even in our dreams: reunion*. Proper propaganda sounding material. We were educated EXTENSIVELY throughout grade school and middle school about the Korean War (or, as Koreeens call it, 6.25 war. Cause it started on June 25th, 1950). We were taught on how after we were FREEDOM'D by the States after 4 decades of getting fucked by Japan in every possible oriface, the Cold War settled into our tiny peninsula and how the war started. Throughout these history lessons, neither the material nor the teachers had negative views towards the North. We weren't told of the gory details when we were just overgrown babies (in Grade school). About the public executions, reality of the famine, constant fear of the leader, etc.\n\nThen there's the military service, where every male member of the population have to go through.This is mainly, if not only, due to the division of Korea. So dudes hate the fact that we live in a country where the current truce goes back decades.\n\nI know the question is about how we were informed of NK in school, and I know that I've ranted just about everything *but* education.\n\nBut the truth is, in SK nowadays, noone really gives half a shit about Korea.\n\nThis next part might just apply to yours truly, but it might as well be just another country at war. \n\nWe don't feel the constant ominous pressure blowing down from above: no, the most we ever get to feel that our former- nation is divided and now is currently at war with one another, is through news reports, just as you would if you lived in North America, Europe or just about anywhere else.\n\nWe don't dread the \"inevitable war that draws ever-so-closer\". We have so much shit on our plates to deal with, even within the country, thank you very much.\n\n\n\nThis is long. Wow. I'm pretty sure I was just on an old-man-rant for about 90% of this text wall, but if you feel like you can take at least something off my comment, then shit, I've done my part.\n\nI'll be here all night folks.

When the war broke out and the country was divided, most if not all Koreans had to choose whether to live in the North or the South.  This was right before the divide so going across borders were fairly normal albeit the dangers of the war zones.  \n\nThe North, with the backing of China and the communist party, would establish Kim Il Sung as the dictator.  Thus, my grandfather chose to relocate to the South.  His plan was to head out towards the trains first in order to insure safe passage for his family to the train station.  Upon arrival, he waited for his wife and kids to arrive but they never came.\n\nAfter waiting for what could have been a week, he had to make the choice of leaving without his family.  He told my father that he never heard from them, how could he as they were separated for good after the borders were established?  \n\nAfter arriving in South Korea, he met my grandmother and started a new family.  For all we know, we have a lineage of step relatives living in North Korea who may have no idea we exist.\n\nThis is solely on what my father has told me and in no way verifiable.  Thanks for listening to my family's historical short story!\n\nTLDR; grandfather left North Korea, effectively leaving his wife and kids, never to be reunited again, and started a new family in South Korea after the countries divided.",

I live in US now, but grew up in rural South Korea in the late 60s through mid 70s, so my experience is of that time (Korean war was still fresh in the minds of people and anti-communism was at its peak). \n\nFirst, a disclaimer: I grew up in a small rural town so state propaganda (i.e., from Seoul) didn't effect me that much.  In addition, there wasn't a glut of media like it is today: television broadcasting hours were very limited (4 to 5 hours in the evening), for example. So my experience regarding North Korea was mostly word of mouth.  \n\nI spent most of my free time in manha (manga in Japanese) cafes (bang) and even as a 7-8 year old I could see some aspects of propaganda incorporated into storylines.  They were mostly things related to envisioning South Korea as an economic powerhouse in the new post-war world and other mundane things like hygiene.  Mention of North Korea, however, was absent.  I do not remember learning about NK in school. South Korea went about its existence as THE Korea (Dae Han Min Guk).  I learned the anthem which praised the natural wonders of Korea, which includes a prominent mention of Mount Baek-Du, which is in North Korea.\n\nWhile I didn't learn about North Korea through official channels, I heard about them quite a lot from adults in my life.  At the time, we did not envision that North Koreans lived in absolute poverty or were behind technologically. (To be honest, this is before the 80s boom in South Korea so perhaps there's not a lot of difference any way between the 2 countries at the time).  What I consistently heard about was the brainwashing aspect of communism.  When I was 7 years old, I was afraid of 2 things: communism and unification church.  To me, they were very similar in that they took control of your life and turned you into a zombie.  South Korea was under a dictatorship at this time, but there was no authoritarian control of the day to day existence of everyday people (at least not discoverable by a 7 year old).",

    "body": "Hi, I'm a legit Korean. Glad to know that this kind of topic actually gets this much attention even from the crowd worldwide. \n\nSchool taught me that I should be sympathized with North Koreans because most of them can't enjoy such luxuries that I take for granted. In the past, I think most people in South Korea keened to have reunification. Even my teachers used to tell students that they want our nation to be united as a whole. We believed that's for the best. Also, school emphasized those number of families that had to be forcibly separated after war. So, that was one of the reasons for reunification. \n\nHowever, now we see it as more of a burden. There are some factors that we need to consider: (1) North Korea used to be considered as part of \"our\" country. But now it feels more of like a separate country. (2) There's a slight language barrier. North Koreans use pure Korean while South Koreans use a mix of Korean with some English words. So, if I remember correctly, in South Korea, they showed a TV program teaching the audience some North Korean terms. For example, what do they call ice cream in North Korea?\u2014\"Eoleumbosungi\" (it sounds cute to me). (3) Economic issues. I think South Korea is way more developed and sensitive to new trends compared to North Korea. So, if there is a reunification of the North and the South, it might be hard to balance the both. (4) Cultural difference. There must be some differences due to South Korea having more foreign influence. \n\nBut most of all, I'm not sure if we're ready to overcome every small and big differences and obstacles in order to have, once again, a united nation. In my opinion, we're both (North & South) not ready for it yet.",

    "body": "Born in South Korea, lived here throughout my secondary education. \n\nI cannot account for education on the topic in primary schools, but I can give a rather brief explanation from secondary school onwards.\n\nTextbook wise, we learn a rather brief history on the division and North Korea in secondary school. The difference between the histories of North and South Koreas are completely the same up until WWII since the peninsula remained united for a millennium or so. However, the history curriculum is rather focused on ancient to medieval ages, and the modern history of Korea is explained very briefly. This is because democracy in South Korea is relatively young, and a lot of political events in modern Korea were deemed controversial and up to debate to be put in a textbook. Especially for a textbook for secondary schools where facts are often listed without much interpretations.\n\nIn high schools, you have another mandatory subject (I hear this was changed rather recently. It wasn't mandatory when I was in high school.) called 'Korean History' where things are explained in a more detailed manner. I do not really know the details since I did not take this class back then when it was an elective, but the textbooks seems a bit more focused on Korea's modern history, obviously containing sections on the division, and North Korea's history.\n\nLooking through it might seem that education on North Korea for the general public is rather lacking. However, most (if not all) South Koreans are very aware of the situation in North Korea, let it be from media, past experience of older family members, or military service. Also, remember the 'united for close to a millennium' part? The bond and sympathy South Koreans feel for North Koreans gets weaker as generations pass, but it is a general consensus that they are still our fellow people, and dream of being united once more (to clarify, not all the people are hoping for the unification due to the economic chaos it will cause).\n\nAdditionally, all South Korean males without a reasonable excuse have to serve in the military, where they are educated further on North Korea.\n\nEDIT: To put in the time frame perspective, I was educated in the 2000s to early 2010s.",

    "body": "I was born in Seoul and raised there by my Grandmother and Aunt till I was nine, when I eventually joined my father's household in the US.\n\nWhat I remember, growing up back then and going to elementary school was that the schools did not really have a particular agenda teaching about North Korea. Furthermore, back in 1992, when I was a second grader, I never really had the impression that South Korea was propaganda-wise particularly sympathetic to North Korea. Maybe it's a different atmosphere now and I haven't been back to South Korea since 2005, but I've heard that people are more or less sympathetic but reluctant to absorb the economic difficulties due to reunification, if it were to even happen.\n\nBack when I was living in HyoJaDong as a kid, I remember the elders saying negative things like, \"commies,\" (in a somewhat negative connotation) quite often. Not to mention, I lived 2 blocks from the Blue House at HyoJaDong, which had by that point become a ghetto with only few prominent elders who stayed behind and rest of the elites having relocated to GangNam. Granted the really rich still stayed behind in SeoChon. \n\nAs one other commentator mentioned, yes, the schools were rather benign in their portrayal of North Korea, but by no means, were the education departments sending a propagandist message of reunification. That was more or less the voice of elders who had split families or other misfortunes. \n\nFor one, my grandfather was a public official, that is until he developed alcohol dementia after years of depression and turmoil, having left behind his two oldest sons in North Korea. In addition to that, he lost two of his properties when he co-signed for a friend, who ran away after failing a business. \n\nPeople like my grandfather and my family were obviously more inclined to promote reunification, since our families had been split apart by the war, but there was also visibly a lot of commie hate back then.\n\nPersonally, I never felt like the school systems do much in South Korea to educate students on North Korea. It's almost like second nature that you just know about North Korea and feel unfortunate for the people there. \n\nFor me though, it was growing up in my family that I had to rather endure unwanted history about our family roots and history of North Korea. \n\nLike I mentioned above, my grandfather was a public official until he basically went insane. It's almost sad what kind of reality my grandfather and grandmother, or even my Dad's two older sisters (aunts) had to endure due to the Korean War. I honestly don't even know what was my grandfather's real name. He had 3 names due to fleeing to Manchuria, then from the commies, then to South Korea.\n\nFor instance, when the commies started taking power in North Korea prior to the war, my grandfather was accused of being a Pro-Japanese Collaborator and was in hiding in Manchuria. The irony about my grandfather having to live in hiding in Manchuria is rather interesting, because my grandfather if anything was a scholar, Chinese and Japanese professor, and pro-nationalist, but not a pro-Japanese Collaborator (my family hates the Japanese).\n\nUnfortunately for my grandfather, after he managed to sneak back into Pyongyang to continue his underground anti-communist movement, the war broke out in June 25th, 1950. Back then, due to his hiding from the Northern Commies, he couldn't flee the war with his wife and children, so as a result, my grandmother had to carry my younger aunt (baby) and hold her older sister by the hand and escape to the South prior to June 25th, 1950, only to leave behind their two oldest sons due to the war breaking out. My grandfather while in hiding couldn't really escape with his two sons, and if he had been in contact with his sons, our whole family line, including his sons and all relatives would have been executed for protecting a Pro-Japanese Collaborator. Either way, I heard that by dumb-luck my grandfather managed to escape, and the result of it was one of his older brothers getting shot and killed in the process. \n\nIt kind of sucks growing up in a family like mine. They are very prideful of their heritage and especially academics. Even my Dad went to Seoul National University, so there is that burden on my shoulders. What especially sucks is the fact that there is a lot of regrets in my family. Regrets of losing all our wealth that was left behind and confiscated by the Commies. Regrets about my grandfather who was a somewhat well-known figure himself, who eventually succumbed to his depression and became mentally ill. My Dad who couldn't pursue his dreams due to the family collapsing and becoming poor when he was in middle school. Hah, my Dad used to tell me when maudlin, how neighbors would call him \"\ub3c4\ub828\ub2d8\" (equivalent to Batman being called 'Master' Bruce) that is, until the family finally collapsed when my grandfather's friend ran off after failing a business and we lost everything as a co-signer.\n\nI specifically remember when I was living in HyoJaDong, some of the elders I had never met or even spoke to come to me and ask, if I was whoever's son, and addressing my grandfather with a \"sunsaengnim.\" It all comes to me now and I understand why random old people knew my grandfather and my dad, but the only part of my grandfather that I did see when I was a kid, was basically him insane most times and sane every so often. \n\nEveryone had good things to say about my grandfather. I was merely a kid back then, so I didn't really understand the implications my family history had, but I learned that my grandfather wasn't some small man, when he had passed away and about 3000 people showed up to march during his funeral ceremony. Everybody really had just one thing to say about my grandfather, and it was that as unfortunate it was for him to have passed away with regrets and sorrow, he never gave into corruption and although he didn't have to live in seclusion, he chose to distance himself from politics. \n\nAnyways, after all is said and done, nothing really matters at this point. My father passed away from a cardiac arrest last December. He was the only true blood-line I had left. I don't even know my biological mother's name, or face. I mean, I'm sure I can go to a government office in South Korea and find my birth certificate, but it all seems inane now. \n\nBefore my dad passed away, we had made a promise that we wouldn't continue the ancestor rituals beyond grandchildren who had actually seen their grandparents. My father is dead now and I definitely don't have kids (thank God) so I'm thinking I will continue the rituals for my grandparents and my dad in seclusion and end the tradition at my generation. I just don't see the point in continuing the tradition, when there are too many implications, and I certainly don't want to pass that onto my children. \n\nThe misery in our family history since the Japanese occupation is immense. Apparently our last name \"Kim\" of the \"\uac04\uc131\" tribe is minuscule with only like 50+ descendants alive in the South Korean peninsula. None of us even know each other, mainly because my grandfather was the youngest son of the main family descendant that escaped to South Korea, and his older brother and sons split off to escape to China. \n\nI heard from my living aunts and from my father and grandmother that the head family managed to escape to China and actually contacted my grandmother when she was alive in South Korea. But to be honest I don't even want to deal with it anymore. I don't even think my aunts are that happy I'm dating a 3/4 black, 1/4 white, mixed girl. Obviously, if I settle down with this girl, there is no point for them to have to deal with this family issue, I don't even know how the far relatives, if we do get in contact, would even feel about mixed children nor myself who isn't particularly prominent academically. Now granted, I am going to go back to school when I save enough money, but I already went to school twice and fucked them up both times, because I never liked the studies to begin with...lol.\n\nAll in all, for any of you who read up to this point, I commend you for having the patience to read through this comment, which deviated from the original question at hand. \n\nI just kind of wanted to let people on reddit know how foreign interests fucked over many families like mine in South Korea. \n\nI can only wish the Korean War never happened, then I'd probably be living like a chaebol with the family wealth that was confiscated by the Commies. Meh, actually, I would probably donate all the wealth, because I'd be pissed being labeled as a Pro-Japanese Collaborator. Honestly, all the Pro-Japanese Collaborator families and their wealth should be confiscated by the government and redistributed to South Korean citizens, since it was the Pro-Japanese Collaborator families who betrayed the emperor and sold the country to the Japanese for bribes.

I also mod the sub r/hanguk, a sub for Korean speakers of Reddit(mostly Korean natives, but many foreign speakers as well!)     \n\nPreface: I looked at the top comments, and unfortunately, I see a lot of Korean westerners who don't have contact with their home country for decades, trying to weigh in on the matter. Apology for all the commenters, but **I see too many people who are not fit to qualify to answer this question**.

Well, me being a curious kid, would try to watch the news with my dad every evening and I learned about their existence. The reason I was...so morbidly obsessed with them was because of their news anchors. The north Korean news anchors' accents and outlandish speaking....man it was so hilarious as a child! I would try to become popular in school by doing skits of them. I was a sweet kid back then.   \n\n\n   \nI actually learned of their true identity as soon as I entered elementary school. The schoolbooks taught North Korea along the lines of 1) We got liberated but those evil Kims captured the north and started a terrible war 2) We were hostile for most of our modern history, 3) but it's the new millenium! the 90s! sunshine policies! we went together as a unified team in some Asian games tournament(we even went to Sydney as a unified olympic team in fact). 4) Although there's a long way to go, unification is near to us than ever before 5) cue to families who were separated during the war 50 years ago rejoice at Kumgang Mountain.     \n\n\nActually the 90s were days filled with the highest point of optimism towards North Korea, in our whole history. Cultural Exchange and Unified projects were happening unlike ever before. (The German Unification really triggered us haha)    I was naturally fond of them. They speak and look, and are part of us, but are poor because of the famine(North Korea suffered a huge famine during the late 90s) so we should help them because they are one of us yadayada.",

It's a shame that political reasons separate the countries today. South Koreans don't hate North Koreans. They just hate the government that rules over them.  \n\nI believe that the general consensus of the younger generations is that reunification isn't a priority. They believe that their country is a mess and reunifying with North Korea would further exacerbate things.  \nOn the other hand, it's usually the older generations that seek reunification. They're the ones who actually faced the effects of civil war. They're the ones who have become separated from their families. Sadly, as this older generation dies out, I think reunification will slowly be out of the minds of South Koreans.  \n- I'm on mobile. Sorry if the formatting is off.

For me, an earlier memory about North Korea is the classic tabletop situation \"finish your meal, there's kids in (poor country) that are starving\".  So back then North Korea was just a poor country that was right above us when I look at a map of the peninsula.  \nI don't remember grade 1 and 2 having too much about North Korea.  Around that time, I remember a bit of curiosity about North Korea because it was during the world cup and we were competing as different nations.  For me, and maybe for many others, parents were the best source of knowledge.  The issue is very political, so I can imagine people learning different opinions of different magnitudes.  \nWhen I returned to Korea around 5th grade, there was a bit more about North Korea in social studies.  Most of the discussions talk about unification positively, while recognizing there are many difficulties.  Probably the only way to talk about it considering the political nature of the topic.",

    "body": "I was born and raised in Seoul, South Korea until my family immigrated to the US. I continued to learn more about Korea's history and politics after I moved because I wanted to be informed about my native country. A lot of people already provided great answers and I would like to contribute to this thread as well!\n\nI cannot recall when I truly first heard/learned about North Korea because the relationship between N and S is so deeply embedded into the history of the nation and it is very difficult to pin-point the exact moment.\n\n------------\n\nPersonal Background:\n\nI know that my family, similar to so many other Koreans in the mid to late 20th century, was directly involved during the Korean War. My grandfather served on the South side and I have distant relatives who got separated/lost/killed. The older generation was heavily influenced by the Korean War (i.e. in the military, fleeing from the invasion, dead/lost/separated families and friends, destroyed cities, homes, etc.).\n\nMy parents' generation was influenced by the aftermath of the war (i.e. social, political, and economic unrest and changes thereafter).\n\nI was neither alive during the war nor lived through the rather turbulent period of national unrest after the war. I am not sure if the geographic region affects one's opinion about N Korea (i.e. someone from Seoul vs someone from Pusan vs someone from vs someone from the countryside, etc.) but that is something to keep in mind.\n\n------------\n\n**In School:**\n\nIn elementary school, we learned about the war and the separation of N and S. The teachers and the textbook readings always emphasized that despite the divide, we are all one Korea, and that we should all work together towards the unification. More information and details about the conflict and the complex relationship between N and S is covered in the upper level grades.\n\nWe wrote letters to the North Korean children (I am not sure if they were ever successfully delivered). \n\nOn the 25th of June, (6.25 Start of the Korean War), we watched a movie called \ud0dc\uadf9\uae30 \ud718\ub0a0\ub9ac\uba70 (TaeGukGi: Brotherhood Of War, 2004). Without giving away too much, the movie is about two brothers during the war. ^It's ^a ^good ^movie ^so ^I ^recommend ^it.\n\n------------\n\n**Outside School:**\n\nAlthough the schools teach the idea of unification, I found difficult to grow up without having a negative stereotypical image of North Korea. As a little kid, the term \"North Korea\" or \"North Koreans\" always evoked angry, evil, belligerent, or impoverished, starving, brainwashed, and uneducated people.\n\nWhen someone looked messy and unkempt, some kids would jokingly say \"you look like a N Korean.\" \n\nI know people sometimes call the North Koreans \ube68\uac31\uc774 (pronounced like: bbal-geng-yi) which is a derogatory term for communists. It's equivalent to \"red commie\" in English, to my best guess. But nowadays, it's more used to denigrate and deprecate those who do not agree with you (especially in politics).\n\nEvidently, despite the effort of encouraging unification, the 38th parallel is not the only thing dividing the North and the South.\n\n------------\n\nI hope I answered your question. Please let me know if you have any other questions!\n",

They have trouble communicating since they have a different dialect, having to deal with discrimination since they are from the North.

They have been separated for so long that it seems they forgot that they're all still Korean and forgot to work together as a society.\n\nI hope when reunification comes, that they will all learn to work with each other and stop with the division.",

Grandpa fought against the japanese during the japanese invasion. Lost both his brothers during korean war in front of his face by nk soldiers.(who would have thought. After all those years of fighting back, family members getting killed my his own people) worked for government for 40years after and retired. saw korea grow.\n\nLong story short, older generations grew up hating the communists at school. (There were lots of communist jokes back in the day) but wanting to unify (1 out of 4 koreans lost in contact their family members. Pretty crazy number) younger generations grew up learning unification is good(we even have a ministry of unification) but doesnt really see a benefit of it.(we just dont care enough anymore I guess) All the other comments got the growing up in sk experience right.\n\nBut generally the government is trying to unify with nk if possible. If you look at how the talk goes among china, nk, sk, and the u.s., basically nk ignoring everyone but the u.s. and when the u.s. not really listening to nk, they ask for help to sk to convince the u.s.. and when the u.s. doesnt like what nk is doing sk goes to china and ask them to help convince nk. And allegedly china has no control over nk. \n\nThe general consensus among the political elites in korea is that(especially the right) u.s. chooses if we unite or not. Sk right wingers want the nk to collapse to unify and sk left wingers want to help the nk and convince them and slowly unify. But at the end of the day we do whatever we can for whats good for nk so they would give up the nuke. We feel that doing them a favor we get to sit down with them. Ideally, we give them a source of energy (sk gov pitched into build a power plant in nk upon the north east but again with the nuke test and missle, u.s. canceled it.) And nk gives up the bomb.\n\nI met quite a bit of defectors and with chinese investment to nk, nk has been developing rapidly. You can even google some pix before and after. They have a concept of market(a lot of the women are involved in this selling goods. Nk gov couldnt stop it since they got rid of rations since they couldnt afford it) where they get usbs with korean dramas and movies to watch with their tablets as well. (Chinese made costs less than 50bucks and no internet of course) supposedly there are a couple of hundred millionaires with real estate deveopment(they allowed it for restricted places from about a decade ago). With that said, more north koreans are trying to come to sk or want to unite (although they cant say it. Not even to their close friends) because of the exposure to capitalism and popular culture we assume. \n\nWhen they do come over to sk however, a lot of them have difficulty getting a job or keeping a job. I heard the defectors say south koreans are not ready to unify many times. Most of them work on losing their accent and dress and act like south koreans. And yes lots of them take their own lives because they are not happy. (Where my main concern is)\n\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "South Korean here!\n\nCouple decades ago, it was taught that NK is a bad bad country that we better all hate. Nowadays it's not like that. \n\nAt young age (elementary school), we are taught that North Korea is part of our country (Korea) that share same history, culture, etc. We are taught that NK should better be reunited with SK soon. There's a well-known song that goes \"Our wish is to reunite\" which kids learn at elementary. They don't even teach about Kim Jung Il (now Kim Jung Un) so much. \n\nOverall, it's like \"North Koreans are part of our people but are suffering from the dictarorship. NK should be reunited with us soon so that they can be rescued and the separated families can reunite.\"\n\nIn middle school and high school, kids start learning history and that's when you learn about Kim Il Sung and the background history and all.\n\nS.Koreans have different views on reunification with NK, but it is definitely considered as a probable option. NK isn't considered as a whole different country, but more as a same country that is divided. For example, the word \"Korean peninsula\" is used often in SK, many times when promoting nationalism. Also, there are still hundreds of families that are separated during the Korean War, and once in a while the two Koreas hold reunions so that some families can meet each other(I heared it's really competitive to be selected). The last one was held in 2015.\n\nHonestly, when I was young, that one country that was taught as \"the bad ones\" wasn't NK at all; it was Japan. Koreans still have resentment against Japan for their colonization, slaughters, enslavement (esp. sex slaves), etc.\n\nThere's a joke in SK saying that NK is like a younger brother because you fight with him a lot, but if someone else beats him, you get mad.\n\nHope this answered some questions!\n\n",

And all the time they dream of reunification of their land and families. \n\nOften times, the information about NK comes from activists who are trying to free people from imprisonment and people who have escaped, or documentary about such people. Elderlies often reminisce about the good old days of united Korea. And just wants to meet back with their family. (It is an often used theme for many documentaries in SK)\n\nThe people of SK doesn't straight up recognize the NK as \"The Enemy\", but rather, an old friend or a family member who turned to the dark side, ventured into a wrong path. SK people blames the incompetence of the SK and NK government for their separation and primarily blames NK government for uniting back again. To the SK people, NK is often looked as a nation that is in need of help, as the citizens are currently desperately are. \n\nAs mentioned in many of the posts, there were yearly or semesterly art competition or exhibition of arts regarding reunification, drawn by students of all class years. They aim to raise awareness to the subject and educate the younger generation to recognize the inhuman acts of NK people towards their own. \n\nGrowing up in an environment that was much different from my homeland was a very new experience, especially getting to love (and hate) the diverse array of foods.

This is the time when the education program was getting updated in Korea to a bit more modern view. So my parents, and or even those in their 30's then had more conservative view, in which the nk's are just brutal evil enemies. My parents still hate them and just fuck them with advanced sk and USA weaponry. In fact my parents would often tell us about this urban legends - nk soldiers deskin sk people during the Korean War. \n\nMy generation was more for peaceful reunification rather than fuck them all. \n\nThe education system focused more on that we are the same \"Koreans\", they just happen to be poor bc of communism and dictatorship, and most importantly that we are victims of imperialism of the us and Russia/china. We had no opinion on how we want to run the country. Rather, the us and Russia were portrayed as evil imperialist who cared only about their ideaology and decided to split the country in half bc they couldn't come down to an agreement. \n\nThis is the reason why a lot of my generations built anti America movement. Younger folks supported the politicians who were against American army stationed in Korea and peaceful agreement with nk. \n\nA lot of movies about brutal criminals acts done by American soldiers came out, Howard Zinn's books got crazy popular in my late teens. (I was in the us, but I was still active on Korean Reddit) \n\nThis created a lot of tension and distance between my gen and my parents gen. \n\nSo the common enemy turned from nk to America.  \n\n",

My oldest cousin warned me to stay close so I don't get kidnapped by the North Koreans.

Plus my uncle had been kidnapped by North Koreans as a kid right before the Korean War (they released him after a few hours).

One was that he was evil and the other was that he had a goiter. I once asked why he had a goiter and was told it was because he was evil. Everything we learned about the country was that it was bad. Once when an American asked me about North Korea, my first reaction was to say that I hated North Korea. I had to think about why I said that afterwards.\n\nThe other part we learned was that the *people* of NK were the same Koreans as us. Many of us still knew people who had family in North Korea. We saw them shake their heads sadly when family was mentioned, and we all heard them repeatedly wish that they were OK. We felt immense sympathy for the people in North Korea, and we were taught to desire unification. This was so embedded in us that I find it rather shocking to hear the younger people say they don't want a unified Korea.",

Every documentary and textbook, or any kind of educational material showed how terrible North Korea was for the people, how people were starved to death, and how many families were torn apart by families. \n\nWe also learned how our OLDER generations viewd North Korea, and it was drastically different, and aggressive; North Korea was depicted as EVIL country that we called \"red bastard\" or Ppal-Gang-Ee, a derogatory term for communists that old people still use. In every form of media, South Korea and America were good guys, and North Korea was a bad guy. Afte the civil war, South Korea was absolutely against North Korea or anything remotely favorable to communism, and would take away the citizens that defended either even a bit. It was the worst around 1960-1980, during which the dictator, Park-Jung-Il(father of the 3rd impeached president, Park Keun Hye) govenred South Korea. It was only 1980s that the country started to re-build any kind of positive relationships with North Korea.\n\nEven now, when Kim Jong Il is the ruler of North Korea, we in general tend to show pity for North Koreans and express regrets as the current Kim is basically ruining any positive relationship between North and South.

Things like how North Koreans are same ethnicity as South Koreans. More sympathizing than hating them, especially about the nk people. That was because back then, our government was run by liberal party which is more pro-NK. What I mean by pro-NK is less hostile to NK compared to the other party, not super friendly to NK like China. And pro united NK.\n\nThen as I became a teenager, our government was run by super anti-NK conservative party. There were no more sympathzing stories about NK, but strong anti communism. It is like they almost dont want Korea to be united. They dont want kids to be too familiar with NK and get sympathetic, attached to them.\n\nUntil Korean president PGH was impeched, Korea has been pretty much Trump level anti NK. I believe younger generations\nwould be still learnng about united Korea thing and all. But less and less people want Korea to be united, especiallly the younger ones. Young people really just dont care about NK. Its an old thing. \n\nNk is more of a joke rather than a serious enemy for younger people. What I mean is yeah, kids are still learning about NK but its significantly less important and less serious than it was.\n\n Tldr, the governments basically decide how to teach about NK. 20 years ago, people cared about Nk more. Now younger kids dont care about them. I dont go to school anymore so I dont know how they do it exactly but I know kids dont care about NK.",

As it pertains to OP's question, my kindergarten classes include ages 4-6.  Most of the kids become aware that there is a North Korea sometime towards the end of their 5th year, or beginning of 6th.  They don't have any real idea about what happens in NK, just that their is another group of Koreans way up north somewhere, and they can't go visit them.\n\nMy classmates, normal 18-24 year old college students, are generally, as benjopark said, apathetic towards NK.  There is still the idea that people in NK and SK are all Koreans, and should live together, but it is more of a mythological idea for this generation.  They focus more on the practical side of unification, and see the astronomical economic cost that would fall on the shoulders of the already overworked South Koreans.",

But people (and generally the society as well) continued their optimism towards the north, way into the Roh presidency(2003~2007). A factory and some resort parks were formed in the North to signify the economic relationships between both countries.     \n\nAnd one thing to add: The anti-north, McCarthyist conservative stronghold was still a huge force in Korea at that time. It wasn't all sunshine happiness and optimism, you know. There was a strong frustration of this coming from the conservative media. Like, America's mainstream media is REALLY tilted to the left, right? Now reverse that, and you'll see the Korean political media here.     \n\nSpreading the McCarthyist notion that the Progressive people here are pro-North \"commies\" were a long tradition of the political sphere here since the inception of the South, but it wasn't gone either during this time. The conservative media began to witchhunt and witchhunt. A close analogy would be like, all the liberal media out to hunt trump's neck right now in America. But it was the reverse situation, and it was targeted at Roh Moo Hyun, the president.       \n\n\nAs I entered middle school, and began to read more books, I became increasingly skeptical of North Korea. The most memorable argument that affected me was the economic angle. \"West and East Germany-East Germany was one of the most wealthiest communist nations of the world, and West Germany was wealthy as well. But look at just how hard it was to unify until this day! The economic struggle when Koreans unify would be borderline dystopian...\" and all the economic arguments.      \n\nObviously those economic concerns would always end up with 1) We gotta do a fund anually from taxes to form a \"Unity fund for the future\"-But that would trigger the uprising of taxpayers and conservatives. 2) Let's just send some money and food anually to the North to relive the possible unification... and those bullshit words with no meaning. I mean I wasn't against it but I was skeptical of the Kim regime. I saw them as evil and thought the money would go straight into their mouths.     \n\nThe worst was confirmed. North Korea started nuclear tests. I do think it was around this time that favoritism towards the North started to end RAPIDLY. The right wing was once out again in full force.        \n\nGod I have a mid test next week, do I have to continue doing this???      \n\nEdit: I'm sorry that I have to do other things now(because I have another homework tomorrow) but I was trying to explain, as a progressive leaning young individual Korean, I absolutely despise the North now, unlike the past. Sorry but I'm too busy to continue the story.",

I can't help but think that if we opened up the farming and mining operations there it would generate the money and the raw materials to let them build out their own industries without importing much material outside of super advanced things like CPUs and really heavy industry stuff.\n\nHumans don't like fast change (well I do, but I'm weird) and if they suddenly had access to all the world has to offer it would likely result in a lot of chaos.  If NK is like the US was in 1910, then we could likely move them through 117 years of progress in just 30 years.\n\nAs long as people feel they are getting a fair deal, and can see their kids becoming more prosperous than themselves - they tend to be content with that.",

But the russians said \"Forget it, we're not backing you!\" and without that it was clear the GDR and their leaders were done and done and all that was left for them was to decide how they wanted to go. \n\nIf the russians had backed them and promised to stand with them through the crisis, even if it means murdering the protesters - Honecker would have done just that.\n\nAnd you might want to read on the \"Stasi\" or a friendly guy named \"Erich Mielke\" (he'd perfectly qualify as Bond villain).",

It was a bit of a non-stop guilt fest. I had to spend years filling in the gaps of my history education as a result.\n\nTo be clear, I'm not arguing that it shouldn't be taught just that the methodology was very poor. They taught us about the internment before teaching us about WWII. Since then, I've gone to grad school in Japan and met people who were interned in both the USA and Japan. I've grown to see complexity whereas when young, the issues were presented framed as \"the bad white people did xyz\". Never were we taught about Japanese war crimes. Never was anything framed in \" humans lose their minds in times of war and do aweful things.\" The effect was to make me ashamed of my family and history from a young age.\n\nI probably sound a bit bitter because I am.",

Parity has *never* been reached, the only question is how much of the problem is the war and division.\n\nEast Germany has been absorbing recovery investment for 70 years with parity nowhere insight. Everything from education to earnings to infrastructure are still shockingly unequal. It's pretty clear this one isn't based on secondary factors because things weren't at all like this before the forcible division happened.\n\n(Intriguingly, the Czechoslovakian successor states and Hungary seem to have more in common with West than East Germany. I have no idea why this is.)\n\nNorth Korea is far worse off than any of the other reunification states I can think of. Poorer, more heavily propagandized, divided for longer, divided for more crucial periods. Missing meaningful progress from 1990 - 2017 (roughly, the digital revolution) would be a crisis, and the NK situation is vastly worse than this. The sole advantage I can think of is that NK has such low population density that it would be possible to approach the infrastructure problem from scratch - East Germany still uses Soviet buildings, but NK could probably build whole new cities if someone paid for them.\n\nI fully expect that even with international aid (including Chinese cooperation), North Korea would take a century or more to bring to South Korean economic levels.

I learned an insane amount of it in that class (sadly I forgot a lot of it since).\n\nI was always fascinated about the concept of slavery (and subjugation in general). Like, how can you look at another human who has arms and legs and language and other than color looks just like you, and treat them as if they were no more than a can of beans. It just blows my mind, that lack of empathy.\n\nAnyway, she did a fantastic job of explaining it all to us and our state's role in all of it. We even took us on a trip to the market square downtown and explained to us that they would sell slaves there. I had seen that thing a million times and never knew that's what it was for. I just thought it was some old landmark. We got to stand inside and it was extremely powerful to me that I was standing in a place where less than 200 years ago people, ancestors of my friends, were being sold. Fuck.\n\nI had a lot if great teachers growing up and she was one of the best.",

Eastern Germans may have lacked certain conveniences that were taken for granted by the West, but they were not exactly starving before the reunification. E.g. Eastern Germans being unable to buy bananas was a popular meme of that time. And if you wanted to buy a car, you would have had to wait for many years or even more than a decade due to the centrally planned economy. But those are luxury problems compared to NK which constantly seems to be on the verge of a famine. \n\nThe GDR's economy was also not competitive, and many of the state-owned businesses had to be shuttered. This created a lot of unemployment, a lot of which lasts to this day. Many of the younger generation moved to the West as a result of this structural weakness. However, the divide was not nearly as great as it is between SK's information age economy and whatever it is the North is doing. Western Germany's economy in the 90s was still mostly dominated by traditional industry.\n\nIn terms of culture there were certain differences, but the GDR's population was mostly aware of their government's widespread propaganda, which was often mocked in private. Despite the illegality, many Eastern German people would also watch and listen to Western television and radio, so they had a decent sense of what was going on in the FRG. I don't know about the situation in NK, and how much they are aware of what's going on in the South.",

But now its filled with small stores and stalls, with everything from a store with the widest selection of hot sauce I have ever seen to stalls filled with hand-weaved baskets made and sold by the geechee descendants of those same slaves that were bought and sold there.\n\nDefinitely mindblowing, with the added surreal effect of it still being a bustling market place and not a quiet somber relic or museum.",
