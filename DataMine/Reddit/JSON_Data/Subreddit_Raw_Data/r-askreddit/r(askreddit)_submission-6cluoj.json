He dodged child support payments for close to 8 years and didn't contact me or my sister during that time (from when I was 5 to 13). When I was 13, he popped back up out of the blue and wanted to visit, but he lived in the Ozarks now and we live in New England. So he flies out for a couple days and we visit, don't really hit it off, and he goes back home. \n\nA few months later we get a letter from some producers in LA, saying my dad called the number for Judge Judy and filed a lawsuit against my mom, demanding she reimburse him for the money he spent to visit us. It says Judge Judy turned it down, but that they had a new show yet to air called Judge Joe Brown they wanted my parents to appear on. If she said no, there was no legal jeopardy for her, they show is for \"entertainment\". It also said my mom could file a countersuit against my dad. So, being SUPER-PISSED, she did, for everything from school tuition, to books, to dentist bills, to my sister's speech therapy, food, school supplies, clothes, fucking everything for 8 years. Came out to like $150,000. \n\nNow, the filming date is scheduled, and it happens to fall on my first day of high school. My mom decides that's too important a day to miss, so I'm cut from the trip. They fly out, get put up free in a nice hotel, free meals, spend a while in hair and makeup, then start filming. Within 3 minutes the judge boots my sister from the room, says that a little girl doesn't need to see her parents fight in public (good man!). The judge listens to both my dad and my mom. My dad's reason for suing was that my mom lived too far away. Judge asks who decided to move to the Ozarks. Judge calls my dad a moron. Judge listens to my mom list off all the shit my dad skated on. Judge says if he could, he'd give her every dime she asked for, but the limit is $5000, and she's getting it all. Judge tells my dad he should be ashamed. My mom calls my dad a deadbeat on national television, crossing that off her bucket list. \n\nBoth she and my sister got a bonus $300 appearance fee and cards from a bunch of people who book extras/background for soap operas and stuff. Then they spent the next day at Universal Studios, the same day as the MTV Movie Awards, so they got to watch all the limos arrive and some of the red carpet for that. \n\nThen on the flight back they ran into some soap opera actors from General Hospital, which is my mom's favorite. Good trip for her.",

It's a show where a person's family calls in a team of experts to totally re-furnish their house while they're away from home for the day. The audience at home are led to believe that all of the work is done within 60 minutes, and they make a point to start their countdown on camera and rush everyone in to meet their deadline. \n\nAbout 10 of us joined the makeover team at around 8am on the day and were given flat-pack furniture to make outside the house before they started the makeover. The crew had a skip outside where they threw all of this poor unsuspecting guy's furniture, only to be replaced with this cheap stuff that was only available to him via sponsorship of the programme. (They list all of the new furniture's manufacturers in the credits at the end of the show.)\n\nThey also masked off all of the skirting boards and light switches ready for painting before we were let loose inside.\n\nWe were let into the house as a member of the ITV crew declared the start of our 60 minutes. After 30 minutes of frantic, patchy wall painting, carrying lamps, uncomfortable seating and chip board coffee tables into the house we were told to vacate.\n\nWe then had lunch in the street while the experts went in to clean up our mess and then did it all again for another strict 30 minutes. \n\nAfter we were finished and the official 60 minutes were over, there was another period of professionals  tidying and filling in our shoddy decorating before we all gathered outside and waited for a man to come home from work. He would find that all of his furniture had been smashed into a skip outside his house and replaced with stuff that may look good on camera for a couple of seconds during a quick sequence, but would be very disappointing to live with.\n\nThis man would be happy about his makeover and we would leave the scene as more experienced, well rounded students with an insight into TV Production.

She said they were constantly fed alcohol, were put on a strict sleep schedule where they were literally put to bed and woken up. Also, there were no clocks anywhere, so all the girls were in the constant state of alcohol fueled disorientation. There were no \"chance\" encounters where the guy is sitting on the couch and the girl goes up to tall to him, all of that is staged. Even their conversations were re-shot over and over if the reactions weren't right or their wording was off. The entire thing was completely controlled and she said no one really knew they guy because none of their interactions were real.\n\nA friend of mine's house was on house hunters. He wasnt on the show himself, but his house was the one that was picked. And yes, it was sold and all the paperwork was signed before they filmed. He was there when they filmed all the segments but wasn't allowed to be on camera.\n\nMy wife was on America's Got Talent. She was a dancer for her friend's act. She said they lived in a tent for 4 days in the parking lot. She had a very positive experience. She said she met a lot of cool people and that it did feel genuine for the one episode she was on. Her friend made it through that round but got eliminated the following week.",

When we filmed it was for a bariatric ambulance tv show. In the morning when the camera crew got there they filmed us driving lights and sirens around the parking lot. Then we did personal interviews where they let us talk about moving bariatric patients and how we felt about our jobs. Then they made us say a bunch of stuff that we normally would never say like \"without us these patients would die\" etc.. they used these clips of the stuff they made us say and spliced it into the real stuff we said.\nOur actual ambulance transport seen in the tv show was 100% planned and scripted. The patient wanted to go to the ER and have some decubitus ulcers looked at. However this patient being diabetic had a high blood sugar of 400 having just eaten and taken insulin. We took that and were forced to treat it like a life or death situation and then they used our earlier footage of saying things were life and death and our driving around the parking lot lights and sirens to make it seem like we were fighting for her life.  In reality in about 30 min her sugar was going to go back down to normal and life would be good.  \nThe whole experience actually really turned me off to reality TV and made me realize how fake everything is.   If people are interested I'm sure I can find the youtube clip. I just have to double check and make sure I didn't sign a non disclosure agreement.  \n\nEDIT------I found the clip and will post a link.

So this woman approaches me and says she likes my outfit and that she works for a fashion show that she'd like me to be on, and asks for my contact info so she can follow up afterwards. \n\nLater on I get an email from her and find out it was What Not to Wear.

They told me I would get a prize of my choosing worth $20,000 plus an entire new wardrobe of fashion designer clothing, but the trade off is that it would be really degrading and probably ruin my self esteem, plus they would destroy all of my \"alternative\" clothing. They said I would have to get all of my friends and family on board so they could have interventions to tell me how bad all my clothes are. \n\nEventually I decided money is money and went into the audition which was in the SAG building (I also decided I was going to hide all my favorite clothes so they couldn't destroy them). A filmographer was asking me some questions when the director walked in and dragged him out of the room. She came back in a minute later and told me she thought my outfit looked great, that she had no idea how I had ended up there but that I was welcome to recommend any other poorly dressed friends to the show. \n\nI guess in the end it was a confidence boost but $20,000 prize would have been pretty sweet.

They edited it down to about 5 minutes.

But people misunderstand this. They don't actually hand contestants scripts. The staff, especially the editing staff uses it to build a story out of the hundreds of hours of footage they take. I imagine they have a direction they want to head in before they interview contestants, and then they build the story however they want to out of what actually happens.\n\nEdit 2: I went and watched the episode again, and on the other hand I do want to follow up that of the things that I can fact check about the episode, there were plenty of things that weren't exaggerated and the contestants were just that spazzy anyway. And the majority of the way my boss (at the time) was portrayed was accurate to what happened and her character. BUT, while it wasn't the majority of the content, I found at least one example of manipulated content.

I believe it is restaurants only in Canada but may be confined to a smaller area.\n\nThe premise of the show is like kitchen nightmares only shittier. Failing restaurant, not enough business, family run, decor is blah, food is mediocre etc. Celebrity chef along with an interior designer/contractor comes in and they check the place out, including food. They proceed to fix the place in terms of the menu and the interior/exterior asthetic. Owners are happy, the end.\n\nI work as a cook and have for eight years and a chef of mine calls me up seeing if I needed some extra cash, which I did. Without even asking about it I agreed to it and then he explained. Instant regrets. (most cooks/chefs try to stray away from selling out as soon as possible, majority hate the idea of celebrity chefs, with a few exceptions)\n\n The episode I worked on had a Celebrity Chef picked already and I was just the one to prepare everything that was to be shown and filmed. I was never actually on film. I was never even credited. I was even paid late. They said it would be two weeks cheque in the mail and it ended up being three, plus they asked for branch/chequeing info to do a direct deposit. The Celebrity Chef didn't do anything to help me. He spent most of his time, honestly, having make-up redone and flirting with the ladies on set, owner of the restaurant included.\n\nAnyways, all the food on the episode was prepared by me and even then, only to the point where is \"looked\" correct. No need to taste anything.... I didn't even fucking have salt and pepper. Worst part is half the shit I prepped wasn't even used. It was annoying because you would think it was easy since they didn't give a fuck about the actual flavour of the food, only the looks. Hell no, they were giving me ridiculous time constraints because they were rushing filming and were doing things so haphazardly. \n\nI don't want to ramble on but it just makes everything on these kinds of shows seem fake. I should have never done it. Being a passionate cook and then doing this filming bullshit just drains the soul ever so slightly. \n\nThat was my run in with food and television.\n\n**TL;DR:** Did an episode of a restaurant makeover type show, celebrity chef didn't do anything. I did all the prep/cooking work. Makes food in television seem super fake and unappealing now.",

They claimed I drove a luxury vehicle to the taping when in fact I didn't own a car and used public transportation. My small studio apartment was described as a luxury loft. They made me change out of my street clothes and into a designer outfit that cost more than two years of rent; complete with Chloe handbag and dramatic diamond jewelry. They use binder clips along the back seams of our clothing to make it look custom tailored.\n\nSeveral panelists were full time students or graduate students who lost their jobs. But the producers edited out all mention of academics and made it sounds as though no one was engaged in any time of schooling or job training. \n\nThey asked us a lot of pointed questions about whether we were respectful to our bosses, stole from our companies, lies on our resumes, fabricated degrees, cheated on licensing exams, or quit for the unemployment benefits. \n\nWe were a bunch of 20 and 30 something professionals pushing through a rough economy to the best of our abilities. They edited us to sound like whiny babies who were abu tot cry at the prospect of not vacationing in the Madives that season. \n\nSo yeah...pretty fake.",

I can't speak for how the other shows do it, but as far as I know the same production company that shoots the original Pawn Stars was also responsible for the spin-off so I don't imagine the methods are too different. The items are real, I saw some really fascinating stuff brought in by genuinely excited normal people. The deals, however, were fiction. I watched them shoot multiple endings on several occasions; the seller would be told to reach a certain number (or aim for no deal at all) and then they'd improvise a negotiation scene over the course of the take. The director would then have them repeat this process with various end results to give them options in editing. It was exactly as awkward to watch as you'd expect, and I'm not sure I ever saw the shop actually buy anything off screen or on.\n\nThere was also a guy that worked at the shop that the show portrayed as a stereotypical backwoods idiot for comic relief. The guy was actually pretty articulate (and genuinely nice), and he was essentially just acting.\n\nThat show lasted about 3 seasons before it got canned, and last I heard the shop owed the city over $100k for a nonsensical lawsuit they filed after the show got cancelled.

    "body": "I worked on a couple of low key reality shows a while ago. This is what I learned from the people who worked on other shows.\n  \n- Each show has a team of \"Story Producers\" who stand behind the cameramen with walkies telling them to get specific shots. As the reality is happening, the story producers are there to make sure they're getting the shots they need to make whatever story for the episode. It's really hard to make something that didn't happen, but it's not too hard to change an emotion, or a mood, within what happened. Like when a woman doesn't like seeing the guy kiss the other woman. Just use some out of context shots and boom.  \n- Mostly everything that people say on a show is what they said, but sentences can be taken out of context. Sometimes if the editor is good they can \"frankenbite\", which means they can take specific words to make a new sentence. This is rare because it's pretty hard to do, and you have to find a place to put it. Usually off camera and subtitled.  \n- Producers will often talk shit in private interviews to get reactions. \"Did you hear that so and so said this about you?\" Booze also helps fuel drama. And they cast people who are going to be dramatic anyway.  \n- Producers will also select people to be on the show. Like Pawn Stars. The producers select which customers get to be on the show. With Hardcore Pawn, it's the same thing, but more for a dramatic event rather than someone who has something interesting. \n- When it comes to makeover shows, it varies. You could either have a Pimp my Ride, which did cosmetic fixes to cars. Or an Overhaulin, where they did a full resto-mod on the car. It just depends on the show.  \n- However, if it's a game show, or any show where you win money, the federal government sends a rep to make sure the game is fair. There's laws against rigged gameshows.  \n",

This is usually how I make all of my expensive purchases.\n\nWe arrived on a brisk February afternoon, the parking lot filled to the brim with cars, so I had to park in the back. There was an extremely long line of people going out the door, I learned that this line was for people trying to pawn/sell items, there was another entrance for show room customers.\n\nAs my friend and I approached the entrance, some guy explodes out of the exit for the showroom, and I swear to christ this guy is on drugs, and he is making a beeline for me. I swear the dude is about to random act of violent me. \n\nAs this gentleman is full chat approaching my friend and, I notice a camera crew off to the side on intercept, its about to go down.\n\n\"FUCK THOSE GUYS! THEY JUST WANT TO TAKE YOUR SHIT! THEY WON'T GIVE YOU FUCKING ANYTHING AND WILL ACT LIKE YOUR JUNK IS GARBAGE.\"\n\nThis guy is tripping out, eyes bugging out of his head, spitting when he is talking. As his rant comes to an end, a microphone bone makes its way down to my face, and I responded, calmly and concisely. \"I just came here to buy stuff.\" I said.\n\nThen I casually walk past the malfunctioning human being and enter the showroom. As I shopped through their stereo aisle, I was met by a chuckling producer. \"I need you to sign a consent form, that moment outside was way too funny.\" \n\nI gladly signed my form, they took a photo of me holding a number, and I convinced the guy running the home theater section to sell me a bad ass Sony 5.1 receiver for $75 that was practically brand new. \n\n10/10, would do again. \n",

His girlfriend at the time was a topless dancer, and their show recruiters went to the club she was dancing at to pick up girls for upcoming episodes.  \nShe agreed to film, and managed to get a deal where my ex would get to appear on the show with her. Behind the scenes negotiations involved coming up with a storyline and light scripting (the plot would be that he was appearing on the show to propose to his stripper girlfriend, and she would reveal that she was actually prostituting herself and would introduce him to her pimp). The show runners loved it and even agreed to provide an engagement ring for the bit.  \nSo he woke up for his morning flight, turned on the TV while he packed, and watched the twin towers fall on live TV. 9/11 blocked his chance at white trash fame.

Being kids we went to go see what was going on and spent the whole evening trying to break into the venue and hide so we could pretend to be ghosts and scare them.

I explained to the news man that there are plenty of graduates that would love to get an MD, however bureaucratic organizations like the AAMC and AMA limit the amount of spots a medical school can offer. For example roughly 50k students applied to medical school in the US last year, but only roughly 20k were accepted. I explained to him that part of these restrictions are to protect the future income and job opportunities of current matriculants at the cost of providing accessible care for national community.\n\nHowever, he was trying to craft this story about how medical school is just too expensive, so that deters applicants. Yes, medical school is too expensive, however the [data](https://www.aamc.org/download/321442/data/factstablea1.pdf) shows that many many people are applying to schools.\n\nHe then got me to say the words, \"scholarships, financial aid, grants\" and the news station ultimately strung some words together to make me appear to say something completely different. Basically what I said on air is: \"It's challenging for students to get scholarships, grants, etc to fund their medical studies\".\n\nAfter the airing of the piece I complained to the dean and he said kindly, \"Welcome to my world, be careful what you say on TV\"",

They do get recognised occasionally. There's a great one they did in London where their \"victim\" looks directly down the camera.

The girl was a pageant queen who was a total bitch and her mother would spend thousands on dresses and stuff, right away you could tell the family was only doing it for the attention. \n\nThey did this thing where they would introduce a reward system where they take away all her toys and if she did her chores and was nice she could get one back. Apparently it doesn't matter whether your good or not they will still film you getting the cookie monster soft toy back.\n\nThat time that has passed where supernanny comes back after a few weeks? Yeah, totally fake. Just put on a different set of clothes and change your hair up and all of a sudden it's a few weeks later, at least to the cameras.\n\nLast note here, a small group of kids (including me) went to go and meet supernanny between takes because it was a small village and it's probably the most famous person to visit ever and for some strange reason I got the vibe that she wasn't that comfortable around kids. Maybe it was just because we kind of walked up to her in a group but she was pretty adamant to get away from us.\n\nAnyway I assume the girl is still a bitch but I'll never know because she moved away shortly after.",

It's in Vegas, so people who are in town to gamble and wouldn't normally need to use a pawn shop will totally sell their Rolex to hit the tables again and have a chance to win, and B.

If you can wait months or years to sell your item, sure, you can post it online and hope someone will pay the amount it was valued for. Or you can sell it at an auction, I'm not totally sure how auction houses run but I assume they get a fee, and again, you have no guarantee someone at that auction will see your thing and decide to bid on it at the price you set.

They mortgage it, waste the money, and get foreclosed. So all that charity work and good feels gone because the family ends up where they were heading in the first place. Another favorite is I've read people who did Fixer Upper would move out of the house and then list it as an Air BnB or similar since it has that 'star power ' attached to it.",

Interestingly enough, one of my tattooers currently working on my second 3/4 sleeve said that one of the knock-on effects of the show that they have noticed in their shop is that they are getting fewer requests for cover-ups, primarily because of the reactions of the \"tattooers\" on the show. If a client thinks they're going to have a tattooer laugh and take the piss out of them for one bad life choice, then they're unlikely to want to get it out to show anyone.

It's far too big and black to cover up, but it can definitely be helped and he was really open to doing it and really complimentary of the idea behind it.
