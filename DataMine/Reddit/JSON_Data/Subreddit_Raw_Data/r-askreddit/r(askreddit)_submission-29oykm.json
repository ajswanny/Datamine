All the benefits of medicine, none of the malpractice!\n\nEDIT: I've commented to others below on some things, but here's a bit more detail about what I do and such...\n\nMy days are varied. I am in a specialized library (a smaller medical library with a small general library collection in a medical center). I spend most of my days doing reference, by choice. I search the biomedical literature on a variety of topics for doctors, researchers, nurses, students, and patients. \n\nI am also a clinical librarian, and go on rounds with an inpatient clinical team to provide information support. This may be anything from helping them get the latest treatment guidelines to searching, filtering, and summarizing the literature in support of evidence-based medicine and patient care for complex clinical questions. \n\nI take part in collection development, helping the library head determine which resources (journals, books, etc.) we get for our patrons. Because of the library focus, this is both for the medical / dental / science collection and a more generalized, public library-type collection.\n\nI love what I do, but it's definitely not for anyone. It's a labor of love in a lot of ways, as there isn't a lot of money to be made, even with an advanced degree. There seems to be a constant struggle for resources, support, and respect. Sure, we have our champions, but there are still widespread misconceptions that as a librarian all I do is check out books and read.",

Also, MDN docs for certain weird HTML features. Also, there's a ping pong table in my office, a beer fridge, and a few dogs running around. \n\nIt's an extremely laid-back field, for the most part, but a high level of production and competency is expected as well. While we have fun, if something needs to get done for a release, we're fully expected to work evenings and weekends as necessary to get things into QA's hands. \n\nIf you're okay with spending your entire workday in front of a screen and your workplace being, on average, approximately 80% male, you might be able to consider a job in a tech field. Programmers are expected to be pretty good at logic, and to be familiar with *at least* one object-oriented language, unless you're in one of the very specific areas where functional programming is preferred. If you don't have a CS degree, don't worry, you probably won't ever be in one of those areas. \n\nSpeaking of degrees, very optional. They're nice, but skill is more highly considered. ",

    "body": "I do in-house *Graphics Design* and *Digital Marketing* for a small company.\n\nIt's a good job that can go from very, very busy to very, very cruisey. Some days can be spent entirely on reddit, other days you'll be up to your ears in work.\n\n**Graphics design:**\n\nI mostly use the Adobe Suite, specifically a combination of Photoshop (to edit photos, or touch them up/change them if there's content we feel isn't right or should be removed from the image. Sometimes I just use it to make funny, random shit at work and send it to friends on Facebook), Illustrator (This is where all the illustration happens, like if I need to quickly make a vector of a graphic, or need flat graphic elements in designs) and Indesign (used for laying out of print materials such as letters, flyers, brochures, etc etc.).\n\nThe programs I rarely use  every now and then are AfterEffects (To edit video or assist our video guy in creating content) and Dreamweaver (Used for HTML and CSS, as well as FTP access.).\n\n\n\n**Marketing:**\n\nThis involves using Google Analytics (to see how many hits the website is getting, identify pages that cause people to leave, helps you gauge how the audience uses your website and how engaged they are), Google Adwords (to advertise our latest campaigns etc) and social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook (connecting with people on a personal level and promoting our campaigns), as well as mass SMS campaigns and EDMs or Electronic Direct Mail (email marketing).\n\nI'll create layouts and design the EDMs and send a few test ones to my supervisor and manager and send it out when they give the 'OK'. A lot more complicated than that, but that's the gist of it.\n\nI also have to track the URLs using the Google Analytics URL builder, which simply lets you know how many people click on your links and purchase things from your websites etc etc.\n\nThis is then put into a report that I hand to my supervisor and manager monthly.\n\n\n**Day to day work:**\n\nYou'll find me mostly on Photoshop and Indesign, making new web banners, or laying out the latest customer newsletter. Sometimes I get an interesting job that requires me to animate something in AfterEffects, or take photos of VIPs visiting our office.\n\nMost of the times it's quite balanced work. Not too busy, but I'm not totally free either. It's a good, constant and manageable level of work. A bit of reddit here and there, some facebook chatting and majority design work.\n\nOther duties involve being called upon to update the company website with new content and create advertising banners that promote our latest campaign etc.\n\n\n**Pros:**\n\n- The place I'm working at has very nice people and I think this is quite true for many of the design companies/firms about. What it really comes down to is a) who you choose to work for and b) your clients. I'm just really lucky I have a laid back and understanding supervisor and manager, but a lot of the people in high positions here are very nice.\n\n- We also get cake! Every month we get a cake or two for the people who have birthdays that month.\n\n- We also get to slack off an hour early to booze up and eat snacks on the last Friday of every month.\n\n- Free food! Sometimes we'll hold meetings and conferences for people from other oganizations and every time that happens, there's bound to be a banquet of delicious sandwiches, wraps, dessert and fruit.\n\n\n\n**Cons:**\n\n- Getting annual leave was made difficult by the new HR manager. It used to be easy, and you can send in a leave form three days in advance and get to have it. Now it has to be two weeks in advance, and it has to be signed by motherfucking EVERYONE in the building. Thanks anal HR bitch.\n\n- Chasing up with people for feedback can be a bitch. Some people make their instructions very vague as well, so sometimes you're left wondering if you're heading in the right direction. It's always resolved with just asking some questions though. This isn't that big of a complaint.\n\n- When it gets really busy, you'll be staying back A LOT, sometimes night after night.\n\n____________________________\n\n**Who I would recommend this type of work to:**\n\nIf you're a creative thinker and you have good time management and are handy with a computer (especially the Adobe Suite) then you'd most likely enjoy a job like mine! It has great perks depending on who you work for, and you'll be challenged in fun (and sometimes frustrating) ways, but solving it using your creativity is always rewarding.\n\n_____________________\n\n**Prior Education:**\n\nI was at a design college for three years and completed an Associate degree, then a Bachelor degree. It's a quick course compared to others.\n\nThey taught me everything I need to in terms of what makes good design, creative thinking, management and  how to use programs from the Adobe Suite.\n\n_________________\n\n**Salary:**\n\nI'm from Sydney, Australia. The starting salary isn't great but it's not bad either. You can quickly climb up the dollar ladder as you gain experience. Going from an intern to a junior and then advancing to mid weight and heavy weight is all about work experience, so as long as you're working in the field and learning new things, you will always have opportunities to ascend to the top. You just need to have the right attitude and motivation! (Applies to a lot of things, I know, but it's very true for this area of work).\n\nThe gross annual salary average for Sydney is around $48K.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**UPDATE:** Wow, this is a huge wall of text compared to the other comments in this post. Sorry about that, I got carried away. I hope it helps someone/anyone stuck with what to do after with their life career-wise though!",

I've always been good at math and spatial reasoning, so it just kind of made sense. That, and when I was 5 I stated that I wanted to be a bird house builder at my kindergarten graduation. Guess I just stuck with it from there.\n\nAMA!\n\nEdit: Because this was asked quite a bit, I'll add it up here. On a day to day basis my job can be a little repetitive. I do a lot of work in AutoCAD, and have become pretty familiar with some of the more powerful features, which makes my job even easier. I have a 3 project managers who basically dole out work after they win a contract. We don't do a ton of design-build work so I stay in the office most of the time, but given the Texas summers I don't really mind. I do lots of work for municipal governments, small towns and the like, while many projects are pretty similar they all have something different that makes them a little challenging. \n\nMaybe 75% of my day is spent actually working, the rest is shopping for MTG cards, headphones, and checking world cup coverage. Recently I hit my 4 years of experience and plan to sit for the PE exam this fall, basically an 8 hour open book test of the knowledge you have gathered in your college and work experience. It's basically the first big step after college for most Civil engineers and kicks open the doors for the rest of your career.\n\nThe pay for CE's varies widely depending on your field, experience, and drive to get to the top. The job market is usually alright, as people always like to build things, but there are definitely some speed bumps depends on how specialized the work you do or plan to do may be. To add to this, I wasn't a straight A student in college, but i wasn't a drop out either, this field is just as much about practical knowledge and problem solving skills as it is about that piece of paper. If you hate math, statistics, vectors, spreadsheets, and constantly your whole grading plan because the architect wanted to move the garage to the back of the house and rotate it a little, this may not be for you.\n\nCivil Engineering has numerous specializations, Transportation, Structural, Environmental, Energy, Water Resources, even some forensic analysis and probably many more. You can get a job just about anywhere in the world with a CE degree and i would highly recommend looking into some degree plans at high ranking universities to see if anything speaks to you before you enroll.",

    "body": "I am an environment artist at Visceral Games, which is an EA developer.  I am currently working on Battlefield Hardline.\n\nMy job entails creating 3D assets such as architecture and props (including modeling, texturing, and applying appropriate materials to them) as well as having ownership over either large portions of levels or entire levels themselves to design and set dress a gameplay space.  My role also often has me serve as a hub between level designers, texture artists, lighting artists, and sometimes animators, coordinating each discipline so that we are all effectively working together to create a holistically believable and aesthetically awesome looking space.  I take direction from an Art Director who has a birds eye picture of the overall look of the product we're trying to create, however I also get a large amount of creative license in building something to my own sensibilities.\n\nI studied for four years at Savannah College of Art and Design which basically amounted to four years of getting as absolutely good as humanly possible at using Maya and Photoshop.  While I didn't know *exactly* what I wanted to do when I graduated high school and went through college, I did know a number of things about my personal interests that helped inform a career path.\n\n* I love video games.\n* I liked CG a lot and found it to be a far more interesting form of art than traditional methods like painting or sculpture.  I also found CG to be an art more geared to my interests in computers and technology.\n* On top of that, I like creating CG that can be interactively experienced rather than just creating imagery.  I liked creating levels in third-party level editors that came with my favorite games more than I liked creating really good renders in a 3D software package.  I preferred CG for games more than CG for film.\n* I enjoy solving technical problems and working out logic puzzles.\n* And finally --- I felt that having skills in creating CG art is a particular skill that could potentially be very lucrative in the right field.  Not to say its a golden ticket!  There are LOTS of CG artists out there, a bazillion of which who are vastly superior to me, and truth be told it is a viciously competitive job market.  But, there are also still a very finite amount of CG artists who can create quality material on stringent schedules, and these are skills that I felt like I had a fighting chance at carving out a space in.\n\nFor anyone trying to get into this line of work, I cannot emphasize enough how absolutely **not relaxing of a career this is.**  You will bleed for this job.  But I can also tell you that if you're actually trying to get into this line of work, that all probably means nothing to you..  This is an industry carried by people who are blindly passionate about building games.  You almost literally can't do the job unless you absolutely lo-o-o-ove it, carnally, on an atomic level.  And the moment where you can go to a store and see the project you've been cranking at for 2+ years sitting on the shelf -- man, you just can't put a pricetag on that.\n\n**EDIT:**  I'm getting a lot of messages and replies asking me what one should focus on to follow this career path, and I figure I should touch on the one thing I personally believe is the most valuable tool aspiring game developers should get to know super deeply:  **Unreal Engine 4**\n\nNeedless to say, getting as good as absolutely possible at creating 3D art is extremely important.  But also take time to learn how to get that art into Unreal and make it look good in the engine.  Because that's where its gonna go ultimately, is in the engine.  Not only is Unreal, IMO, currently the absolute best environment/toolset for game development I think that is available for the public to use, but many many of the concepts you learn in order to use Unreal are technical game development concepts that can easily be applied to other game engines and toolsets.  Concepts in shading/materials, lighting, performance (get to know what a \"draw call\" is!) and logic scripting are all things that I have used across many different engines and more or less are conceptually the same.\n\nAlso!  Check this out:  http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/1bxfex/eli5_networking_what_it_is_how_to_do_it_and_how/c9aztcf\n\nThis is the single best explanation of successful professional networking I've read in a long time.  When I've talked to people about how to network, I often am paraphrasing this comment.  Its really really good.",

How much do employers care whether I've gotten a degree from Harvard, as opposed to NYU or a state university? Will the debt I carry from more prestigious schools be paid off in a reasonable amount of time with a job after college/university, or would it be smarter to go cheap on college spending and earn the degrees I need as I go along in life? American education is expensive and I'm kinda scared for my future. \n\nWhat's the viability of blue-collar jobs? I've heard stories on reddit about guys who work in like high-purity titanium welding or something and they earn six-figure wages with not that much debt from their trade/vocational schools. \n\nAlso, sorry but I've though of one more: if I go to a foreign country for a degree, how difficult is it to get a job in that country? (I'm considering an education in Canada, but I've been discouraged due to the whole \"oh you're foreign, natives dont want to hire foreigners\" stuff.) \n\nI really appreciate any answers to any question and sorry for a long as fuck post. \n\nEdit: Thank you all for your responses!

    "body": "I'm a copywriter and I got into it shortly after finishing college. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2.5 years and I broke up and I was stuck working a dead end job as a delivery driver. I took a few days to think about my life and I realized I wanted to get it together and be successful, by starting to believe more in myself. I studied creative writing, so I had no experience it, but we had a small section in a course I took on the relationship between image and text. \n\nI thought I'd give it a shot, so I quit my job, moved back home and started looking for something. After a month I ended up getting a job at a small agency that was run by I guy I met the year before doing a craigslist gig as a secret shopper. He was cool enough to give me a shot and I worked there for 6 months. \n\nHowever, it was a long commute and no room to move up since it was only 7 of us. I applied to other jobs, but never heard back, so one day I saw an opening for a position at a company I really liked. Their listing was slightly humorous, so I decided to actually be myself in my cover letter. Even though I was really under qualified for it, my cover letter caught their eye and they brought me in for an interview. \n\nTwo months later they brought me in to freelance and after a month hired me fulltime. I've been there for slept a year and a half and I love my job. I work on beer brands, so it's a lot of fun and our company has a great culture. Oh, and we get free beer every month too.\n\nEdit: Here's [the cover letter](http://i.imgur.com/HMA3I4B.png) that got me my dream job. The reason some parts are in bold is because I figured if they were just skimming it, those would pop out. Cool thing is the Senior CD that interviewed me (who has since left the agency) gave me the original printout of the email that the creative SVP gave to him of it, so I keep it in my cubicle.",

    "body": "I'm a medical researcher. Specifically, I work in a Neuroscience/Endocrinology lab. I have a BS in Biology and an MS in Nutrition Science (just graduated). In scientific research, the line between graduate student and employee is blurred quite a bit so while I'm currently considered a graduate student in my lab, I get paid (not much, but reasonably) and have basic employee responsibilities. The great thing about pursuing a career in medical research is that you literally will get paid to investigate things no one in history has ever figured out before. If you have the curiosity to want to understand some aspect of the human body inside and out, this could be the career for you. It requires a lot of education, but provides a lot of intellectual freedom. \n\nThe downsides are that academic research positions pay relatively little given the impressive qualifications of the employees and that research funding can be difficult to secure. You will constantly be defending the importance/impact of your work to secure funding. It is your job and yours alone to make people realize what you are researching is interesting/important. There are many paths to becoming an independent researcher. A doctorate degree will be required in a scientific field (biology, molecular bio, bio engineering, chemistry, biochemistry, nutrition science, biophysics, genetics, bioinformatics, etc.) or a professional field (MD, DMD, etc.). Some people even pursue extra or combined degrees (MD/PhD) to become independent researchers. Though I plan to have a research career, I'm getting an MD starting this fall so that I can fall back on a clinical medical practice if the research funding situation goes further downhill in this country. \n\nIf you're interested in pursuing science as a career, in addition to getting the right coursework under your belt, be prepared to read and write a lot after school is done. I probably read 2-5 scientific papers per day just to stay on top of the latest literature.  \n\n",

I get paid 9.85 an hour to complete a certain list of tasks before my shift is over. These tasks include: cleaning up spills or messes of any kind, collecting trash, crushing cardboard boxes, doing floor sweeps, stocking the bathrooms, emptying and taking care of the bottle redemption machines, and literally anything else the managers ask me to do.\n\nWhy do I bother mentioning this job? Because everyone I have ever met assumes that it's such a shitty job, and they all ask me how I bear doing it. But as far as I'm concerned, it's an AWESOME job. \n\n1. You don't have to stand in one place for 4-6 hours and get bored like a cashier or bagger or something, you are constantly on the move.\n\n2.  More importantly, *because* you are constantly moving around any and all areas of the store, it's impossible for managers to keep track of you, so they don't bother to. They just want to know you've arrived at work and when you're taking your break, and besides that you are completely free to do whatever you want, whenever you want, however you want. You work with nobody breathing down your neck or keeping tabs on you at all.\n\n3. That isn't to say you don't have to do work. But like I said, you're only expected to finish a list of tasks before your shift is over. If I get a rhythm down and work quickly, I often have half an hour to an hour of free time every shift that I spend relaxing, strolling around, talking to people, doing random chores at my leisure, or browsing reddit on my phone. A couple times I've even snuck in a couple short naps on long days.\n\n4. If you become good friends with the fellas in the meat department, they just might give you first dibs on the samples they put out. I've been treated to free bacon, steak, hot dogs and sausages more times than I can remember.\n\n**TL;DR: Being a janitor in a supermarket isn't nearly as terrible as everyone assumes, in fact some days it's pretty awesome.**",

This is our duty to change their perception.\" People generally think that sales people are sneaky, greedy, and generally out to get them. But that is not always the case and certainly not the case for me. I don't mislead my clients because I want to build long term relationships and not one time deals. If you're in it for the long term you end up making more money anyways. \n\nA lot of college graduates feel like they have to go into accounting(low salary), marketing(low salary), legal field(long hours), or medical feild(only do it if you want to help people, please don't do this if its just for the money). The idea of working in sales never enters most college graduates minds.\n\n\nI've heard a few reasons why people don't consider sales as a profession.\n\n\n* Its beneath them.\n\nIf you think its beneath you then, I don't know what you're looking for. I know plenty of people in sales are bright, driven, and make a yearly salary well into the 6 figures. I've heard Marc Cuban and several other business leaders state clearly that their sales team is the most important part of their company.\n\n\n* You have to have a special personality.\n\nIf you think you have to have a special personality, you don't. For me sales was a learned skill. I picked up some books, I had a mentor teach me how to speak with prospects and get them to buy. I learned to get over my fear of rejection and my fear of talking to people. The first day I started I was terrified of picking up the phone and talking to prospects. I stuttered a lot, I sounded like an idiot, and I'm pretty sure the person on the other side could hear the fear in my voice. But after a few dozen calls I got better and made my first sale. After that everything got a lot easier. So you can learn to do sales, you don't need to be born with \"it\".\n\n\n* There is no stability. \n\n\nAs far as stability goes, if there is anything the last economic downturn has taught me is that there is no such thing as a stable job. You can't count on your boss, your corporation, or your government. When you work for a company, it is the company's job that you just happen to be occupying. More often than not you are replaceable. In sales, you have greater control over your income and your value. I know exactly what I am worth because I know exactly how much people are buying from me. I can breakdown my exact value to the company and why I am worth keeping or not worth keeping around. I am the one directly contributing to the companies success by bringing in clients that actually give us legal tender in exchange for goods and services. In fact, if I do poorly at my job not only am I out, but since no money is coming in they're going to have to cut jobs. So I influence the job stability of those around me. Stability is a non factor for me, because I don't feel that any job is \"stable\".\n\n\n* Its too hard.\n\n\nI hear people say that sales is hard. That is just the worst excuse to not do something you're not comfortable with. We all only have a finite amount of time in my day and in our lives. Something being hard or easy doesn't matter to me. Its either doable or not doable. And its either worth your time or not worth your time. For me talking to people and showing them my products and services is worth my time because I've done the calculations and know how much I can earn for each minute that I am working. You know what I'd rather be doing than working, sitting at home on my ass eating Doritos and getting fat. But no one is going to pay me to do that.So I have to work, and if I have to work I want to maximize my time to make as much money as I can while I am there. So I don't care if its \"hard\" If its worth my time, I'll do it.\n\n\n* Don't want to lie for a living\n\nA sales person's job is simple, it is to get the client/customer to buy their products. If its a product that the client/customer actually needs or improves their quality of life then everybody wins. If you need to lie to sell your product, you're selling the wrong product or you're trying to sell to the wrong consumer. Most good products out there have a large enough market that you shouldn't have to lie to get them into the right buyer's hands. A person without a product to sell is just a con-man. A lot of sales people are lazy and greedy, so when they have a potential customer in front of them that is a bad fit for the product they would rather lie and hard sell than see that its a bad fit and go find another prospect. This shit pisses me off. This is where our bad reputation comes from. But you don't have to lie, you just have to find the right customer and everyone wins.\n\n\nI'll end by saying this If you didn't graduate with degree that has a very specific job waiting for afterwards(or even if you did), sales can be a really great career. People often overlook the fact that sales is where the big money is at. In nearly every company sales people have the largest salaries.\n\n\n\nTL;DR: consider getting into sales.",

(unfortunately some creepy ones as well...) I give tours at a Witch Museum in Salem MA, basically a brief history of what led up to the Witch Hysteria, then it focuses on some of the less talked about people like Cotton Mather and Phillip English. \n\nI do tell mostly the same jokes every tour, but I try to throw in different ones here and there! I hate suuuper slow days when all we do is wait in the gift shop and nobody comes in. But it's really fun when theres like 30 people on a tour. It's pretty cramped at some points so we end up having to do what we call a split. One tour guide takes half the group through half the tour, and then the other follows with the other half.\n\nIt's my first job, I walked in, asked if they were hiring.

I make sure they are recorded, do basic research, and most importantly make sure they doesn't decay away into dust the next time someone touches them.\n\nPros: \n\nSee the world. I've worked as a conservator in three countries on two continents, and as an archaeologist in a fourth country before that. I know objects conservators who work on all 7 continents (yup, even Antarctica). \n\nIt's never boring. Even on two artefacts of the same basic type you will never have exactly the same problem twice. The entire field is a weird blend of history, chemistry and studio art in different permutations. There's some screwy physics work as well in some of the niche areas. I might be working setting up an electrochemical cell one day and in-painting a fill on a piece of potter the next; it keeps life interesting.\n\nEverything's a puzzle. I have an object right now made of three materials, the normal treatments for which are chemically incompatible. I can't physically separate them without damaging a major identifying component for a nationally protected archaeological site. I have to figure out a way to make the chemistry of three disparate treatments work, and do so without accidentally blowing up the lab (which is an annoyingly real risk with some of the technically feasible options). Again, it keeps life interesting.\n\nYou get to work on some seriously cool stuff. I've worked on Egyptian funerary sculptures, Viking weapons, Roman jewelry, Colonial European cannon, and who knows what else. As a conservator, I'm the first person to actually get a clear look at freshly excavated stuff, because it's covered in dirt or rust or shell until I get a hold of it. The archaeologist may be the first person to touch an object in 3000 years, but I'm the first person to see it as it would have looked then. \n\n\nCons:\n\nPay is shit. You'll need a masters degree, and there are only about 5 universities in the English-speaking world who offer a worthwhile degree. Only 2 of which are in the US.\n\nWork is underfunded. Everyone funds the digs, but every dollar in recovery costs about ten in conservation. Archaeologists and museums continually try to knock that cost down, so you sometimes have to get... 'creative' with your supply line.\n\nSometimes stuff is unconservable, and you have to just let it go. Sometimes things are technically conservable, but involve chemistry or equipment that only three scientists and a magical Argentinian newt understand. Unless you can hire the newt - who is always the most communicative and comprehensible option in that situation - you probably just need to let it go. It's frustrating when that sort of stuff happens, but there's not much you can actually *do* about it.\n\n",

This included many parking garages and evaluating the cleanliness and observing the cash handling techniques of the cashier to make sure he charges the correct amount and does not steal from the company. This was very easy, yet very boring and paid decent for a college kid. \n\nIntegrity spotting was similar to the \"recons\" sent into bars at the beginning of each Bar Rescue episode. I would go for 1-2 hours have a couple drinks and evaluate the employees watching for overpouring, cash handling, if employees were drinking, if employees were giving free drinks to regulars at the bar/club. This paid more and was more interesting but it included a lot of writing when reports were due the next day. \n\nBackground checks were boring but very important and fairly easy. I would go to a court house and run names looking for criminal records and civil records for employers. \n\nPrivate investigating was my favorite part and paid the most. It was often cases of injury insurance fraud, child custody, and cheating spouses. I'd camp out at their home or place of work and wait for them to leave. I'd follow on foot, by public transportation, or car depending on where they went. This was always a rush and was very very fun. Again, reports suck because I don't enjoy having homework. \n\nThe other interesting divisions which I have not worked up to yet are loss prevention and undercover work. Loss prevention is similar to a security guard. You stand near the entrance, see the subject enter the store, follow the subject, and observe if they steal any merchandise. If they do, you run after them and let the other employees know. \n\nUndercover is exactly what it sounds like. The company gets a complaint of sexual harassment, drug dealing, physical abuse, etc at a workplace and we work with the owner to get an employee of our company hired. This employee works their way into the core group of the problem and views everything happening, writing detailed reports for the owner so he knows if any illegal activity that could shut down his business is happening. Our employee gets paid by both companies because they actually do work two jobs. \n\nI have not had experience in the last two but if anyone is interested in criminal justice and working in the limited private sector of that field, try it out. Great job for college kids and recent grads. Also quality assurance and integrity spotting are good part time jobs to make a little extra dough on the side. ",

The general consensus is that this field is for the bullies in high school who couldn't get a better job, or ex-military guys who weren't qualified for anything else, or dullards who got the job because they were the Sheriff's nephew.\n\nThat may have been (and largely was) the case prior to the 1980's.  Thankfully, professional standards caught up with the times.  I work in a department of 60 officers, and only 3 of them (ex military) don't have a college degree.  Those three are currently in school.  Nearly everyone at the rank of Sergeant and above is either working on or has obtained their Master's.  And fewer than you would expect are studying something like criminal justice.  I work with people who have degrees in Agriculture, Business, Physics, Engineering.  Everything is useful.\n\nSure, it helps to be tough, and good in a fight.  (Believe me, it's not so much about all that as it is about *confidence.*)  But, that can be learned.  I was bullied profusely in middle school (270lbs of blubber in 6th grade) was a computer nerd in high school, and went to college on scholarship for engineering.  Never thought this is where I'd end up, but It's right where I need to be.  I have done things I never imagined myself doing and, most importantly, have *learned more* than I ever thought I would.  In 4 years working in law enforcement, I've accumulated well over 600 hours of excellent training.  I've trained with the U.S. State Department, FBI, Department of Education, Federal Air Marshals, CPB...I could go on.  My resume is just absurd.\n\nWe need all kinds.  Just because you don't think you're the paramilitary buzz-cut broad shouldered type, doesn't mean we don't have a place for you.  If you've got a college degree, a hunger for knowledge and experience, a love of people, and aren't sure what to do with all that...at least just do a ride-along and keep an open mind.      ",

Worked customer service (gate/ticket counter) and ramp (everything around the plane).  Did pretty much anything except for fueling, security, and flying the planes.  That includes deicing, emptying the lav tank (gravity does the dirty work) and putting bags in.\n\nAirline job #3: After getting my degree in software engineering, I couldn't leave the airline industry.  So I applied for every programming job in the industry that I could find (and remotely qualify for).  Ended up getting a great job in a great city with some pretty good growth potential, and a decent starting salary.  Also, my knowledge of the reservations system from job #2 sure helped.",

    "body": "Excellent post! The only other thing I would add is the distinction between inhouse, an agency, and freelance.\n\nI personally have worked freelance for 3 years. I currently started a new job as an inhouse designer for a major corporation in Los Angeles a few months ago. They are like entirely different jobs with so little in common.\n\n I recently moved here(LA) from rural midwest. Some locations design jobs are very limited (such as my hometown). You will need a family connection or a phenomenal portfolio in order to land a job and that is even with a degree from a respected school. Location is a huge factor in whether you can find an agency, inhouse work, or end up being forced to do freelance because of the job market. Getting down to differences. \n\nFreelance you are your own boss. If you can live on $12,000 then you can get by on very little work. But if you aren't extremely outgoing, prudent, and/or don't have a lot of connections to businesses then don't expect to make $12,000 doing freelance. Most likely it will be a part-time job for you. It can be shitty, but (IMO) it is better than doing an \"internship\" for a year for free at a company. At least you aren't getting gamed by the system this way.  A lot of my freelance ended up being for friends, family, and groups in the community I was involved in. \n \nInhouse design or an agency will be much more stable work. At an agency you will be working with people who know the trade. Inhouse there will be a very small team of people who have even the slightest clue what you are talking about and it is dependent entirely on your clients on the atmosphere. \n\nI haven't worked at an agency so I don't feel qualified to comment on what it is like. However, I imagine you are given a much greater diversity of work and are allowed to focus more on one aspect of designing (compared to inhouse where you and one or two other people might be responsible for every aspect of marketing from analytics to content creation to production and finish)\n\nTo sum this up this chart might help.\n\n-----\n\n**Freelance Pros:**\n\n* You're your own boss.\n* Anyone can start here.\n* Design for your passions and friends\n* Experience without sacrificing a year/6 months/summer with no pay because of an internship. \n* If you are good, you can wind up with your own agency. \n\n**Freelance Cons:**\n\n* Typically hard to get money because of friends, family, and poor charities.\n* Requires connections or the right personality \n* Difficult to land contracts and if with only small/unknown companies it can be a limiting feature of your resume later. \n* Most people aren't good enough to stay here and be self sufficient without another job. \n\n----\n\n**Inhouse Pros:**\n\n* Stable salary\n* If with the right company it is a great way to built your portfolio with some major corporate backing.\n* Always working with the same clients perfecting your skill in one area. \n* Benefits (especially important in the US, major corporations usually (though not always) have great health plans and many holidays)\n\n**inhouse Cons:**\n\n* Limited range of artistic expression (i.e. always preparing ads for similar items)\n* You can be forced into roles you are not comfortable with because of your knowledge of computers. \n* Limited number of people there to run ideas past.\n* Always working with the same clients (esp. if they are shitty people)\n* Lack of appropriate tools (full bleed printer, analytics software, and so on)\n \n----\n\nAgency I am not qualified to speak on in detail, but it sure sounds nice. The stability of inhouse with the extra benefits of being around a lot of artists and changing clientele. Grass is always greener syndrome I suppose. Plus I'm sure there are plenty of negatives I don't know about without working in an agency first. \n\n\n It really comes down a lot to your personality though I think. I have several art and design friends who refuse to advertise for major corporations because it conflicts with their central passions in art so much. They are fine only doing occasional freelance work and working part time somewhere else. I really respect that, but you kinda have to find your place. Many more people make a successful career out of design work through major (and minor) corporations. Some people are even able to establish an agency after doing freelance work for so long and getting enough return clientele. Do what you want and have fun doing it!\n\n \n",

To weed out those unnecessary frequencies that \"muddy\" the mix up, and to bring out those frequencies to give the highs more definition, and the bass more oomph. \n\nMost concerts sound best between 100 and 115db, depending on what you're listening to. You *should* have earplugs with you, but if you happen to forget them, that's okay. It's the SUSTAINED EXPOSURE that will damage your hearing.\n\nPlease protect your hearing. \n\n",

I get several emails a day from recruiters about job openings. \n\nI currently have a Bachelor of Arts in Elementary Education (K-8) and a Master of Science in Communication Sciences and Disorders. It took 4 years for the bachelors and another 2 for the masters (and I went to school every summer.)\n\nI've always worked I. The elementary school and always in the same district. It really depends on your personality. I'm not a big fan of math and anatomy and whatnot, but I love working with kids. You might love research. If you don't, it's pretty easy to move from one realm of the field to another. \n\nThe main thing I recommend to an aspiring speech pathologist is DON'T GET A BACHELOR'S DEGREE IN COMMUNICATION SCIENCES AND DISORDERS! If you don't get into grad school, there are precisely zero jobs you can get with a bachelor's in CSD. Instead get a degree in a related field like education, psychology, social work, etc and have a minor in CSD. That way you get most of the pre-reqs done, but if you don't get I to grad school, you can still get a job. ",

If you already have a bachelor's degree, you'd have to take the communication sciences and disorders pre-req classes, and then apply to grad schools. \n\nIf you *don't* already have a bachelor's degree, then you can go to college and get a degree in communication sciences and disorders. But I don't recommend that because if you don't happen to get into grad school, there is absolutely NO job you can get with a bachelor's in CSD, and then you're screwed. I'd suggest rather getting a degree in a related field such as education, psychology, social work, etc and making CSD your minor to get as many as the pre-reqs done as possible. I majored in elementary education with my \"area of concentration\" in linguistics and had a CSD minor, so when I got to grad school I only had to make up 2 classes.

Go the extra mile by adding extra info that isn't required by the database, but can be useful for the testers (such as how have you actually fixed the bug, or in which build the fix will be included).\n\n\n* If at all possible, test locally before submitting a blind fix. Have a tester attempt to reproduce the bug at your station. This will cut down on your number of bugs we have to send back to you.\n\n\n* If you need help understanding a bug/task, ask us directly instead of sending back a bug/task with a question in comments. You'll often get your answer much quicker.\n\n\n* Think of QA while developing new features. Would debug features help them test these? Is your feature ready to undergo testing? If yes, notify QA that they'll have a new feature to test in an upcoming build.\n\n\n* Invite a QA Tester to your regular stand-up meetings with your team.

I decided to leave the internship for last and I actually ended up doing it in the fall semester instead of the summer because almost everyone does theirs in the summer and its easy to get lost in the crowd. I ended up being the only intern at the zoo for the semester, which was very good.  \n\nI picked to be in the amphibian department. While most of my time was spent there every week or so I would go out and have enrichment projects with other departments so I got to meet a lot of different people around the zoo. I worked my ass off and stayed extra hours often. I got great reviews from my department and when I finished I talked to mammal department and let them know I was interested in temping for them if they needed it. \n\nI waited almost 2 months, I was actually pretty worried at that point I wasn't going to get a job since this is the only zoo in my area and I couldn't move at the moment, but I got a call to come temp. I was actually only in that position for 2 weeks but again I worked hard and showed them I was willing to go above and beyond. I worked on and off for the next couple months in different departments and just this week got my hours I needed to become union and permanent. \n\nAs far as previous jobs I really don't have any other animal experience other than my internship. \n\nThe greatest challenges vary greatly depending on which department you are in. Most areas are very demanding on your body. They require a lot of lifting, shoveling, raking, ect. Some things can become mentally challenging such as seeing animals struggle, knwoing you are doing everything you can possibly do but the animal just isn't happy. There are a lot of decisions you don't have the authority to make, it all comes down to supervisors who don't know the animals as well as you do and might not realize the impact they have. ",

Leave by 0615.\n\n0700 - Arrive at work and get report on the patients I will have that day. Patients come to the hospital for a variety of reasons and the human body is very complex. This means that there are often things that you will feel that you don't know or have never heard of before. (Nursing school is not medical school and, although it is hard, you do not eat, live, and breathe healthcare like MDs do.) So this means that you have to constantly be learning and staying on your toes. Prepare to deal with words like cholangiopancreatography, esophagogastroduodenoscopy, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, ventricular end-diastolic pressure, and (my wife just yelled across the room) percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. Some asswipe student docs and MDs love to act like nurses don't know what these things mean, but the fact is that you are a shit nurse if you don't. I wipe the floor with 90% of student docs on grand rounds every morning during our intensivist's Q&A. But that's only because I work in critical care every day and that is my specialty. Anyway on to post-report. \n0800 - Assess your patient(s). Sometimes patients are so sick that you only have one. Don't think that this always means an easy day. Patient ratios generally scale by how sick they are. So it all (roughly) evens out in the end. Usually nurses will have 2-6 patients. So you do an assessment and make sure that everything is where it should be (lines, tubes, devices, IV drips, etc) and that they are not particularly in distress at the moment. Then you get your meds.\n0900 - Roughly at this point, you have assessed your patients and will do your first med pass. Pharmacists generally try to schedule most meds for 0900 and 2100, so you will do your largest med pass in the morning. Again, if you are not a shit nurse, you will know how all your meds work, where they work, what dosages they are generally prescribed in, and what their contraindications (meaning no way Jose) are. \n1000-1800 - who knows? Every day is different as a nurse. You may have a coding patient, you may have to escort a patient to MRI, CT, Xray, discharge a patient and admit a new one, or just run your ass off all day chasing docs, meds, or crazy patients. \n1830 - Prepare to give report to the night-shift nurse who will be replacing you. The common saying is that nursing is a \"24 hour job\", so the oncoming nurse -should- be understanding and accepting of anything that you haven't gotten done on your shift, but this is not always the case. \n\nIn the middle of all this you will be charting, charting, charting. When you are done with this, you will probably have to chart. You will chart what you've done, what you haven't done, what you are going to do, and so on. Charting is a major, major part of healthcare. \n\nDo I recommend nursing? Yes, but with some conditions. It really depends on who you are. Please don't go into it for the money. You will lament nursing school and hate every minute of nursing. \n\nAlso, there seems to be a growing number of people who think that they will just \"be a nurse\" long enough to go to NP or CRNA school. These people often times end up washing out and finding new professions. CRNA school and NP school both are -very- competitive and you have to shine brighter than a diamond to get into them. Also, they are based primarily on being a NURSE (NURSE practitioner, NURSE anesthetist, NURSE midwife... see what I mean?), so if you don't like nursing, and you go into nursing, you are in for a bad time.\n\nThat's all I have for now. Sorry if it seemed like I was rambling. Sipping on gin and juice. ",

It isn't that I didn't know what I was getting into (and you do clinicals fairly soon after you start school, so you at least get an idea fairly quickly), its that nursing took over my whole life and left very little room for anything else. I was working 60-70 hours a week, with little or no vacation, and I did that for 10 years. Also, I disliked constantly feeling like I had way to much to do and not enough time to do it. We were constantly understaffed, and, at times, I would have to leave someone begging to go to the bathroom or whatever because I had other more important things to do. I didn't like the way that made me feel. It got to be extremely stressful, and although the money was alright, it wasn't good enough to justify how unhappy I was. I also want to add that I wasn't a slow nurse or a bad nurse, I got all good reviews and was never written up or reprimanded for anything. AMA if you want.",

I had gone back to college because the VA was paying me a housing allowance while going full time, so I wanted to have some money coming in should the job search take longer than expected. Funny enough, when I went back in the fall semester just to take some fluff classes to get that housing allowance, the IT department head (who was also one of the instructors) asked me to teach a semester of Operating Systems as an adjunct, because the usual instructor had quit and the semester was already on. \n\nSo I did that for a while, then I noticed an ad for a sysadmin position in my town, sent in a resume', got an interview, low-balled the hell out of myself (because I was unsure how military IT experience translated to the corporate world) and went to work. Of course, I told them in the interview that I was teaching a semester 3 times a week and didn't want to drop the ball on that, because they had no one else to do it, and they agreed to make accommodations. \n\nI think that part helped out a lot. Plus the fact that I low-balled myself. I later learned there were 20 other far more qualified candidates, but the boss liked that I wouldn't just leave the school hanging. And they thought I was a good fit. (The CEO liked that I wasn't costing him as much money, but I negotiated a REALLY good raise after my year mark.

Start the video with something gripping, otherwise you'll lose viewers before they understand why they should stay and watch.\n\nSeems reasonable to me. The name isn't super important as long as it isn't unreasonably hard to type or say. If you think about it, \"sethbling\" is kinda dumb, but people have come to associate it with good content, so it works.\n\nIt is a bit of a struggle, I got super lucky in that what I enjoy doing is something that I'm also unusually skilled at, and that not a ton of other people seem capable of doing well. I also started making videos at a time  where the canvas was pretty blank, and I could stand out because few people were doing what I wanted to do.",

Two days later, your annoying friend Jimi opens up a pie stand selling pies that smell and look suspiciously like yours.

You will come to me and say \"Hey best zyra, Jimi stole my pie recipe, and I want to sue his ass.  Can you help me?\"  Then, I would go over the data which would include - each recipe, number of pies sold by each of you, pre-existing pie recipes that could be related to both of yours, and finally the specificity of your pie patent.  \n\nI would then use data-magic to decide a few things.  First, whether or not you have a legitimate claim to sue Jimi (its possible he didnt steal your pie afterall and you are just a bitch).  Second, what compensation you would be entitled to from Jimi (this would be calculated from the extrapolated amount of revenue you lost due to him stealing your recipe).  And, third, what the best course of action would be from then on (should you demand he close, acquire his pie stand, or merge with him).\n\nHope that was helpful!",

I'm an editor so I will call out weird edits and especially continuity flaws (which are abundant in so m any movies).\n\nAlso, it can make me appreciate things more because I know how much it takes to get that special effects shot done. It's not easy and if you can make me believe it's real I will be super impressed.\n\nI work in the promo world, so I cut together promos for TVs (like commercials). If I see a trailer or a promo that's really good, it will make me want to watch that movie to see how they did it.",

    "body": "Sure.  Well the thing about human nature is, we automatically treat people we know better then we treat strangers.  So if you get to know anyone on a personal level, they will be more than willing to go above and beyond the call of duty for you, and may even cut you deals.  I'll give you an example: my Accountant is my friend from College.  He helped me basically set up my business(accountants are smart as fuck and know quite a bit about business and the economics of it), provides me with information which helps me immensely(like tax writeoffs; you would be surprised at the things you can write off as a business expense), as well as giving me a discounted rate on his services.  \n\nIt depends on what kind of business you get into, but having a good relationship with everyone you meet will only benefit you.  Networking also helped me get a great deal on my business; a person I knew who was in the industry called me about my business before I bought it; he told me that a man was retiring and was in quite a rush to sell, so because of that information I was able to obtain my business far cheaper then I would have otherwise.
