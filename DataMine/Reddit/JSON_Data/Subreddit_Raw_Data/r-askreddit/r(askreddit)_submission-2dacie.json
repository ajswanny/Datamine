The pool scene in Mrs. Doubtfire was filmed at the pool where I used to swim as a kid.\n\nOne night I was with a friend at the pool and we thought we saw Robin swimming. We kept a close eye on him from 100 feet away, trying to figure out if it was actually him. The man stood up at the edge of the pool and looked over at us. It was him! We waved. He was wearing swimming paddles on his hands, so he immediately went into character, clapped the paddles together, barked at us like a seal and waved back.\n\nHe got out of the pool and walked over to us, where we gushed to him about our favorite films of his. Then he signed a couple autographs, we thanked him for his time, and he went off to the locker room. I'll never forget that moment. What a cool and hilarious dude.",

He was actually commuting on a connect flight to Minneapolis from where he would be starting his trip from and happened to be sitting next to none other than Robin Williams' wife (Robin was sitting a few seats ahead of him). My dad got up a short while into the flight and asked him if he wanted to switch seats with him so that he could be with his wife. According to my dad, Robin Williams responded with a friendly smile and said \"no it's okay I feel a bit like wandering around right now anyway.\" He got up shook my dad's hand and then proceeded to go say hey to other passengers for a bit. My dad said he was one of the friendliest guys he had ever met. ",

I remember my father's tears made me realize what a life-changing thing we were going through together. \n\nMy father passed away 6 years after that - and watching Mrs. Doubtfire next to him in the theatre remains one of my favorite memories of him. \n\nEdit: My first gold would be on a comment in which I'm overly emotional... it's my MO (thank you kind strangers, I consider each gilding a good hug).

    "body": "Today I mourn the passing of my childhood hero. I sit here, a grown ass man of 30, struggling to maintain my composure because of the impact this man had in the development of my character. He never knew me, but I knew him. I knew him through his work and how it shaped my life and effected my growth as a human.\n\nMy father was a stoic individual. A man's man who worked day-in and day-out to provide for his family. He was never one to teeter very far on the emotional scale, and so, I began adopting these traits as well. Until Aladdin.\n\nI was a bit beyond the time of Mork & Mindy, but one of my earlier childhood memories involved my father taking me to see Aladdin. This stern gargoyle of a figure had lost all bearing during every one of the Genie's scenes. He laughed and smiled. The kind of smile that carries with it a sense that everything in the world is *right* for that one moment. That is, for me, when the admiration of Robin's work began.\n\nThen came Ferngully on VHS. I recognized Robin's voice. I had to show my Dad. Again, he laughed. Again, I was at peace. Before the age of 9, I knew all the Marvel heroes, most of the DC heroes, and Robin Williams. That is the category in which he sat with me - because surely a celebrity was just as unreachable. All famous people are in the eyes of a child.\n\nHis performance in both Good Will Hunting and Dead Poets Society instilled within me an *excitement* for knowledge & intelligence. His down to earth, emotional delivery about the potential of one's mind and taking pride in learning left me feeling better about not being a jock. \n\nNow, I understand the difficulty in believing the impact one person can have through simply acting but you have to understand - this was an adult that in no way acted like any adult that I knew or seen. He was showing me with every release that I didn't need to be reserved and professional like all the other grown-ups. I don't know why my mind zoned in on his work, but in every performance  I saw a message. And ya know what? I loved them apples.\n\nI went about my life, growing in my own right. I was by no means a fanatic. I wasn't stalking Robin and his work - I was just happy whenever anything of his would happen to come into the public eye. It's like going to your favorite restaurant and ordering your favorite meal. You **know** you're going to enjoy it. \n\nThen \"What Dreams May Come\" happened. I was speechless. Everything I had ever identified as **love** was being portrayed to me on a screen. I now had an answer to the question \"What's your favorite movie?\"\n\nPatch Adams, Death to Smoochy, Insomnia - it was like watching him evolve as an actor. As a human. And so did I. Not necessarily *because* of him, but certainly *with* him. Fast forward to 2 or 3 years ago and he's doing stand-up in the Virginia area. A place I had happened to move to for employment after getting out of the Marine Corps, marrying and having kids. I stumbled upon the online offer for a meet & greet for the low low price of $200 or so. Now, having recently moved, we couldn't afford it at the time - but oh, how I fantasized about entertaining that luxury expense. \"Next time\" I told myself.\n\n\"Next time\". I'd read about fans who send letters to celebrities and on the rare occasion, get replies. I never wanted to be a bother. Knowing their life being in the public eye must drain them of any desire to interact recreationally on a social level always left me admiring from afar. \"I'll send him a letter another time.\"\n\nAnd that is why I sit here, grown ass man of 30, with tears down my face. I've had family pass and never did I shed a tear. I've bore the burden of struggle and loss. I'm the one that people go to for stability and sound judgement. Yet, here I sit barely able to choke out words to my wife about how it must seem absolutely ridiculous that 'some famous person passed' and I'm broken because of it. But he wasn't simply a celebrity. Not to me. He was happiness incarnate. His whole character was about making people laugh - it wasn't his act, it was who *he* was - who *I* wanted to be. And that was stripped of me. \"Next time\" is no more.\n\nI am not one that lives with regrets. At least I wasn't. My greatest regret will now forever be not telling my childhood hero the impact that he had on my life. The value that I had for his work. He was no saint. But he certainly was for me. \n\nGoodbye Robin. I will cherish & keep the parts of your personality that you gave me always.",

Today, I understand that feeling, I understand that despair, and I feel that loss.\n\nWhen I was a kid I used to wait until everyone went to sleep and then I would sneak downstairs and I'd get the movie Hook from the collection and bring it upstairs with me. I must have watched that movie every night for years. I used to act it out, saying all the lines. It was mine, it was my time to be a lost boy, or an Indian, and to never grow up. Because to me growing up meant losing everything beautiful about life, forgetting everything there is about playing in the sun and swimming in the ocean and feeling the breeze on your face.\n\nGrowing up meant taking on responsibilities being mean setting rules and having to tell children that fantasies are not reality, that they can never be cowboys, they can never be indians, they can never be pirates and people don't fly and your shadow certainly will never run away from you. In a way I still haven't grown up ,I fight t coming he urges. I remember. I remember a time when a stick was a sword and a cardboard box was a shield and I was a warrior, and I truly was happy.\n\nToday I am saddened by the loss of Robin Williams, Peter Pan. I feel like Wendy waiting by the window all grown up with no one to take me to Neverland.\n\nToday, if you ask me, boy why are you crying? I would have to reply that I'm crying because today I lost a happy thought, today I cannot fly.\n\nEdit: never expected this to get so big. Ty all for your kind words. I struggle with suicidal ideation every day. His life and his death have more meaning than I could convey in words. I had to do him justice.\n\nIf you, or anyone you know, is suffering from depression please reach out for help. It is better to MAKE good memories than it is to BE a painful memory for others.\n\nMy inbox is open to any and all who need a pal.\n\nBANGARANG",

I was loading a bunch of tools and picking up a  boxes of nails off the ground when he drove up, stopped and got out.\n\nRW: Hey you! Yeaaah you. \n\nI'm fucking frozen in my squat with my fingers under this box cause its fucking Robin Williams.\n\nRW:Listen I've told that playhouse building little troll not to have his people blocking the road. (I turn to look, no one was blocking the road) Where is he where's that little gremlin, Dave? DAVE! Oh Davey boy. There he is, MY MAN DAVE! Now Dave how many, I mean how many times have I asked you to tell your day laborers that if they're gonna meet you at your house instead of getting picked up at the home depot they can't block the road.\n\nDave looks and sees that the road is clear and turns back to him and says \"ok Robing ill have his clear the road.\" At which point everyone realizes I'm still squatting with my fingers under a box of 16 penny nails mesmerized by the fact that I'm looking at Robin Williams . And I shit you not it was like the Genie from Aladdin came through him. \n\nRW: Woah, hey listen kid if your gonna volunteer some phalanges for sacrifice there are faster ways, I'm sure Dave here has a saw, bring out the saw, no wait, not enough time, get the knife!\n\nDave: The knife?\n\nRW: THE KNIFE!! sure its slow on the bone with with a sharp blade one can achieve wonders! DON'T FORGET THE SHARPENING BLOCK DAVE!! (yells into his face about a foot away from his head) \n\nHe starts going trough my plumbing toolbox and starts throwing copper fittings, tape, rags and finally comes upon a PVC pipe cutter. \n\nRW: EUREKA! (Turns around to me and sees that I'm still squatting with fingers under this box awe struck and with a huge smile on my face and throws the cutter in the air) Dammit Dave can't you ever get one that actually understands English ? Or at least know who I am?\n\nI finally stand up and he sees me standing he starts backing away when he realizes I'm much larger than he is(6'2\") \n\nRW: Woah there big fella, heel, heeeeeel. No harm done, I'm backing away and not making eye contact, backing away and not making eye contact. \n\nWhen he bumps into his car its like somebody said 'scene'. And he just looks up and walks toward me and says hi I'm Robin Williams. I pour over him, telling him how great he is and how he had a major roll shaping my youth and just geeking out on him. He let me get it all out, every last drop of fanatisism I had over him built over the years, the dam broke and I let it out. \n\n I don't know if he was that way with his comedy in public all the time, or because he knew Dave for a long time, or because there is a certain comedy within the construction world that he pretty much had down, but it was amazing.\n\nWhen I got done he thanked me for my kind words and apologized if he insulted me at any point and said he really admired construction workers. Finally he said he had to go and get his coffee before that bitch Cathy started her shift if he was gonna get a decent cup. \n\nThe most vivid thing I remember was when he turned to walk away, he was just another guy going to get coffee, and he got in his car the smile was gone from his face, he didn't turn to wave, he just took off down the hill on that long windy road.\n\nFrom Patch Adams, to Popeye to Aladdin and Mrs.Doubtfire he is a giant. He is loved and will be greatly missed. I love you Robin Williams.",

It was about reincarnation, basically, that they were going to meet again.

From the time I was 3 or 4, I watched Mrs. Doubtfire religiously and I still do. Aladdin was very influential to me when I was younger. As I grew up, movies like Dead Poets Society, Good Will Hunting, Good Morning Vietnam - even The Birdcage - were introduced to me. \n\nIt all culminated one night when I was 12 and up in bed sleeping, but I was woken up by laughing and roaring. I creeped downstairs and saw my parents and sister watching Robin Williams: Live on Broadway. My family let me stay up and watch the rest of the special, and they even let me skip the next day of school since I was up so late. \n\nSince I saw that special, I was introduced to a whole new world of Robin Williams - the stand up comedian. I watched and rewatched Live on Broadway literally *hundreds* of times. I found his old stand up specials, and kept an eye out for his news ones. I watched his interviews, read books about him, and became obsessed with him.\n\nHe made me laugh so hard. He made me cry. It's so hard to live in a world that doesn't have Robin Williams, and how the man of a millions voices can be silenced so quickly. I never met him, and it's not like a feel empty inside, but I feel... off. Like something is missing. Like the world isn't quite right.\n\nRobin, you mean more to me than you will ever know and you always will.

    "body": "This may get buried as it is getting late, but I had to get this out there.\n\nWhen I was a little kid travelling back and forth between Santa Barbara and LA to see family, my Dad would usually listen to music. But occasionally when he thought I was asleep he would put this tape into the deck and a man would speak and the result would result in my Dad roaring with laughter. That man was Robin Williams. \"A Night at the Met\" was the first comedic routine I was exposed to, and though my Mom did her best to tell my Dad turn it off when I would be awake, the damage was done. I was hooked on comedy. Throughout the years I would see Mr. Williams perform in various movies and each film would rekindle my passion for comedy.\n\nIt wasn't until years later that I found out that I had a knack for making people smile and laugh, whether it was at me, with me, or at the expense of someone else. For those of you that know me well, you know how I can get. For those that don't, consider yourself lucky. My favorite Robin Williams move was Patch Adams, a story about a man who wanted to become a doctor, but also wanted to spread laughter and joy to those who were sick in order to ease their pain. \nIt is with that movie that I decided that I could fulfill my parent's dream for me to be in the medical field, and also find a way to pursue my hobby of comedy. I believe that laughter is the best medicine, and though it may not always heal, it can definitely bring a smile to someone's face and brighten their day.\n\nI'll never forget the impact that Mr. Williams has left on my life, and I didn't even get a chance to meet him. This shows that you don't have to know someone personally to make a difference in someone's life, by your words and actions, people will remember you.\n\nSo in closing, I leave you with a quote from Patch Adams which I apply to my outlook on caring for people.\n\"Our job is improving the quality of life, not just delaying death.\"\n\nRIP Robin Williams, thanks for all the laughs, and for the tears.",

It's the way he brings a level of beauty in someone's life.  His death signifies that he was simply human, which is the tragic part.  Because I don't see him as a human being.  I see him as Robin Williams, a genie, a therapist, a teacher, a pirate, a scientist, and a man who was a critical component to my life growing up and current, as well as a man who was a caring father and brilliant improviser.  \nHis improv is my improv.\nIt's so hard for me personally because stand up comedy and severe depression go hand-in-hand for me.  I've done stand up, and depression has been a long standing component in my high school life (just graduated).  My friends consider me this comedic genius but it's very hard because I don't live a considerably normal life compared to other teenagers, and the level of mental stress got me to insane points.\nI'm going to miss Robin Williams terribly.

    "body": "This is an awesome story. I also met him as a child, and he had such an impact on me. Some time in the fall of either 1996 or 1997 (so I would have been 8 or 9), we had a family trip up from LA along the California coast on our way to a Cal-Stanford game. We stopped in Solvang and I got a pin as a souvenir. It was a small gold frog. No clue why I was so set on it, but I remember being very excited about it.\n\nOne of our family friends was the Assistant Director on Patch Adams, which was being filmed in San Francisco at the time, and we were lucky enough to go visit the set. Robin took the time to come over and talk to us, and immediately noticed my pin, which I was proudly wearing. He asked me a few questions about it, and told me how much he liked it.\n\nWe didn't get a picture, I'm not sure why. Possibly cameras not allowed on set? It didn't really matter, the moment has stayed with me forever. He made me feel so incredibly awesome. I was yet to discover his more serious movies, but as a kid, I probably watched Aladdin a few times a month. Hook brought the legend of Peter Pan to life for an entire generation. Mrs. Doubtfire was and always will be a favorite. Jumanji came out on the day of my ~~10th~~ [edit: 8th] birthday and my entire party was Jumanji themed. I loved Robin Williams.\n\nAnd here I was, talking to the man himself, and he loved my frog pin. He had probably just finished a long day of shooting, but he could not have been friendlier, his trademark smile even more impressive in person. As I grew older and more able to appreciate all of his work, it became apparent what an incredible talent he was. Dead Poets Society, The Fisher King, obviously Good Will Hunting, and even the aforementioned Patch Adams. Perhaps most tellingly, if I had to pick one movie to identify as our family favorite, as in, the one movie that my entire family will easily agree to watch at any point, without hesitation the answer is The Birdcage.\n\nFrom reading what everyone else is saying, so many people had similar experiences where he was able to brighten their life in just a few moments. It is such an incredible ability to be able to do this, and for him to do it over and over again proves how genuine of a person he was. ",

    "body": "I can relate to your story. I met him while I was working on a commercial about two years ago.  It was about a little kid on Christmas morning, finding his presents before anyone else was awake. He finds a giant present next to the tree and investigates. All of the sudden a hand pops through the top of the present and begins looking around like a periscope, and slowly starts breaking through the present as the child sits back amazed. Free of the wrapping, robot Robin starts walking around the room bumping into things and malfunctioning, but eventually gets his bearings. We then shot a bunch of scenes where Robin and the kid have all these adventures around the house - racing toy bikes through the halls, and battling the winter storm at the door. \n\nMy job for the day was to do props, and we had to do a bunch of takes of Robin breaking out of the Xmas present. We were shooting in the summer and with all the big lights everywhere to light up the scene it was super hot in the room, so every time I put Robin in the Xmas present it was like a little sauna, as the box JUST fit him inside. We tried to only keep him in the box as little as we could, but a couple time we would get him into it and the director would decide to change the lighting or camera position, and we had already closed and sealed the box.  Normally an actor would be pissed about this(and rightfully so) but Robin just popped his hand out of the box and asked to borrow my polishing cloth to wipe his brow.  He never got cranky, never complained, and talked to everyone on the crew. He showed no ego at all, and was totally genuine. \n\nFor no reason at all, between takes he would talk to everyone in a Scottish accent, and constantly crack jokes, he couldn't help himself from constantly entertaining and making everyone smile.  I had to show him how to ride this little kid tricycle for one I the shots without breaking it(which looked hilarious) and I remember being so awkward and nervous - he was the only famous person I had ever worked with - and he made me feel so comfortable and was totally approachable. \n\nAt a couple point in the day his mood would shift and he would suddenly loose steam, he had to go to his trailer for a bit, but when he came back he was back in character, in front of the camera and otherwise.  I learned later he struggled regulating his mood, and suffered from being bipolar.  He performed in an almost manic state, and he used it to energize his comedy sometimes. Later he would experience the other end of the spectrum and crash into depression.  I'm sure people saw the darker side of Robin Williams, but during my very brief time working with him he gave only joy to those around him, and kept his pain hidden away. I'll never forget those days, and the great impact his movies have had on me.\n\nEdit: found the ad on YouTube, never actually watched it before. I remember it being a lot better watching it being made, but still turned out pretty good.\nhttp://youtu.be/dDdHdgyIBtU\n",

Now while he is spending the night alone he's visited by a sacred vision. Out of the fire appears the holy grail, symbol of God's divine grace. And a voice said to the boy, \"You shall be keeper of the grail so that it may heal the hearts of men.\" But the boy was blinded by greater visions of a life filled with power and glory and beauty. And in this state of radical amazement he felt for a brief moment not like a boy, but invincible, like God, so he reached into the fire to take the grail, and the grail vanished, leaving him with his hand in the fire to be terribly wounded. Now as this boy grew older, his wound grew deeper. Until one day, life for him lost its reason. He had no faith in any man, not even himself. He couldn't love or feel loved. He was sick with experience. He began to die. One day a fool wandered into the castle and found the king alone. And being a fool, he was simple minded, he didn't see a king. He only saw a man alone and in pain. And he asked the king, \"What ails you friend?\" The king replied, \"I'm thirsty. I need some water to cool my throat\". So the fool took a cup from beside his bed, filled it with water and handed it to the king. As the king began to drink, he realized his wound was healed. He looked in his hands and there was the holy grail, that which he sought all of his life. And he turned to the fool and said with amazement, \"How can you find that which my brightest and bravest could not?\" And the fool replied, \"I don't know. I only knew that you were thirsty.\"\n\nRupert: Just goes to show you, Andrew - somebody becomes a human being, sooner or later, they do something monumentally stupid.\nAndrew: You've been a great example, Rupert. How quickly will the blood degrade my system?\nRupert: Oh, I don't know. You exercise, eat right, I'd say 30, 40 years.\nAndrew: That's a little vague, chief. You don't know exactly how long I'll last?\nRupert: Sorry. Welcome to the human condition.\n\nIt's not about understanding... it's about *not* giving up!\n\n\"Seize the day.

It was unexpected and refreshing, and I started thinking about robins williams, because it had been so long since i watched a movie with him in it.  I grew up watching his movies and he had a big impact on my childhood.  So i smiled thinking about it for a while.  And then that was it.  I kept trying to go to sleep but I couldn't.  I didn't finally fall asleep until 7:30am.\n\nThis really sucks.  And for a first moment or two reading the headlines, while hoping it was a hoax, I thought it was such a weird coincidence that out of the blue, for no reason, I was briefly but sincerely thinking about the actor and the impact he had on my childhood early this morning after not seeing him in a movie or thinking about him for a long time.\n\nDepression is a terrible disease, and I'm sad to hear that it got the better of this man.\n\nRemember no one is perfect.

I'd have said the same quote before my kids came, but when PPD hit, I was 100% convinced my kids and husband would much be better off without me.\n\nWhen your stomach is sick, it spews out loads of crap.  And, well, so does your brain.  So I sought help and the medication and therapy worked (thankfully) and shut the crap up.  Helped me realize I was needed and here I still am.  If Robin didn't reach out and/or the meds didn't help, or the sheer weight of struggling with this all his life was just to much...well, here we are.  \n\nIt's just damned hard to watch someone die from a disease I've stared right in the face, especially someone whose work I've enjoyed so much.  To know he was thinking he couldn't go on, that he was alone.  But with all of us out here knowing how beloved he was.  \n\nIt is one of the true ironies of suicide that suicide victims believe the world will be better off without them, when I've watched families suffer so much when losing a loved one to suicide.

It was a year before Ellen would come out of the closet, and it was still largely societally unacceptable to portray a gay person in a movie or TV show as anything other than a buffoon. And then The Birdcage came along, and while it's a comedy, Williams played his character like a real person, like a real gay man who happens to be in this crazy situation and who happens to be helplessly in love with his husband of many years. \n\nI don't think I can tell you how much that meant to us, to see a gay man on screen who acted like a real person and whose love was *love*, not lust, not a joke, not a freak show, and played with total sincerity by a *major* star, who wasn't even gay. This was a *life changing* experience for a lot of gay men, it was artistic validation of who we are. It came at a time when young gay men in small towns still grew up not knowing if they were alone in the world, and here was this movie to say to them that they could find love in this world, that they could settle down with someone and be happy together (even in the midst of a zany comedy). I can only imagine how many lives that saved, how many suicides that prevented. ",

They tell you you have so much going for you, that you're just in a rough patch, that it gets better, etc.  Except, when you're depressed none of that matters.  You go through your day so numb and empty and pretending to be like everyone else because you just HAVE to but it all seems entirely pointless.  So you go to work, see your friends, etc but why?  None of it matters and when you go home you're still alone and nothing feels better and dying doesn't seem so bad.\n\nI'm not suicidal anymore but I've been there and I understand it.  Most people, including my family, were pretty shocked when I ended up in a psych ward after multiple suicide attempts.  Depression is all consuming and until you've really been there, it's so hard to explain.  It's not just being sad.  It's literally just losing the will to keep on living.\n\nBut your friend with PTSD makes a solid point.  I was often so upset when someone would say, \"Well at least you have a roof over your head\" or \"There's children starving in Africa\" like somehow those problems were suddenly supposed to snap me out of it.  I find that very belittling because everyone's problems are all subjective to the individual experiencing them.  I try never to make someone feel better by using a \"it could be worse\" scenario because it's not really realistic to think said person is ever going to be a homeless, starving child in Africa.

Suicide is not selfish, but you probably don't realize the impact it will have on those around you, and no matter how alone you feel, someone else has felt it, too. You are strong enough to get through it, and it's ok to be selfish, but it's ok to live for someone else until you can live for yourself.",

And surely not because death seems suddenly appealing. The person in whom Its invisible agony reaches a certain unendurable level will kill herself the same way a trapped person will eventually jump from the window of a burning high-rise. Make no mistake about people who leap from burning windows. Their terror of falling from a great height is still just as great as it would be for you or me standing speculatively at the same window just checking out the view; i.e. the fear of falling remains a constant. The variable here is the other terror, the fire\u2019s flames: when the flames get close enough, falling to death becomes the slightly less terrible of two terrors. It\u2019s not desiring the fall; it\u2019s terror of the flames. And yet nobody down on the sidewalk, looking up and yelling \u2018Don\u2019t!\u2019 and \u2018Hang on!\u2019, can understand the jump.

His comedy tended to always look on the brightside, how could such a (seeminly)happy guy who was so goddamn funny be so sad on the inside? \n\nI think Williams was a reflection of many thoughts and feeling that are common among regular people. \n\nHow many times over his career did he make you genuinely chuckle? For me it was many times. I listened and watched all through my childhood, watching his older movies still brings back the happy feelings from back then.\n\nAs someone who has regularly thought about giving up, it breaks my heart (if it indeed it was a suicide) that someone like him, who's smile was so contagious, gave up hope. \n\nRIP Mr. Williams\n\nGuess you get to truly see what dreams may come.\nThe world will miss you dearly.\n\n\n(Thank you, and I deal the best I can. I view it as a selfish act to take ones own life. I have many loved oned, the thought of how their life would be to much to bare. So I tighten up and try not to over think myself. I ment every word I said in this post though.)\n\nI'm stuck between crying and smiling. Its sad how dark the world can be; amazing how loving we can be. \n\nReddit, I will never look at you the same.
