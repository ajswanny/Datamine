If you wanted to research Barack Obama's interactions with Australia, you could simply include both terms in a search, but you'd find thousands of articles in which these two terms may appear many paragraphs apart, and bear no relation to one another.\n\nBut if instead you search \"obama\" AROUND(10) \"australia\" then the first results will be one in which Obama appears within ten words of Australia.\nNOTE: for this to work, both search terms must be in quotes, AROUND must be capitalized, and the number must be in parentheses.\n\n(-) Knowing how and when to use the minus sign in a search query.\ni.e. search George Washington -gwu.edu\n\n<number>..<number> to search for a range of numbers. For example, 1..10\n\n(*) as a wildcard in quoted search strings to stand for one or many unknown words. \"The * cat\" will return things like The angry cat, the big brown cat...\n\n(+) will ensure that a word is included in every search result. (per u/izerth, google got rid of the + operator, so now you have to put \" around single words or use search tools->results->verbatim) \n\nQuotes surrounding a phrase will ensure that exact phrase turns up.\n\nTriple quotes \"\"\"word\"\"\" will get you 'actual verbatim' and leave out what google thinks is relevant  (thank you u/heauxmeaux)\n\nfiletype: .whatever will make sure URLs have that extension at the end.\n\ninurl: some.words_here will make sure whatever follows shows up in the URL. Good for refining your search by domain name.\n\nintitle:word returns sites with 'word' in the title bar - aslo useful for index or mp4, mp3\n\nsite:sitename.com will return only results from that site\n\nadd 'forum' to the search to find others with the same question (thank you u/dissectingAAA)\n\nAdd synonyms: Google adds some automatically - To add your own - Custom Search > Search features > Synonyms tab > Add\nType a search term, and then add one or more synonyms for that term.\nClick OK. to search simultaneously for the synonyms of that word.\n\n\nUse Google Scholar- https://scholar.google.com/ to find only relevant articles from academics, case studies, etc.  Great for medical as well.\n\nThat's all I can remember off the top of my head.\nSo if you search for \"lincoln park -square -oak\" you have narrowed the search in a very useful way.",

Like if you want \"miley cyrus nude\" but not her wrecking ball nude, you search \"miley cyrus nude -wrecking\".\n\n**Site operator:**  This is helpful for snooping or finding a particular article on a site.  Some sites have a search you can do on them internally, but I prefer using Google/Chrome.  Use a \"site:\" and add the domain.  \"site:clayburn.wtf sex\" would give you anything related to sex on my blog.\n\n**Search Tools:**  Pay attention to time.  You can see results from the past 24 hours, or the past week, etc.  Useful for finding up-to-date info, so if Windows 10 recently updated and you're doing troubleshooting, you probably don't want an article from 4 months ago telling you how to fix something because the method may have changed since.  Also, in Image search, use Search Tools to filter by size.  Larger images are higher quality usually.  \n\n**intitle:** This is another search operator that is really helpful.  It returns results with the keyword in the title of the page.  So when you're looking for a page strictly about something specific, it helps you weed out stuff that might casually mention the thing in the body of the article.  Also very powerful when combined with other operators such as the \"site:\" one I mention above.  You can find all articles on CNN with \"butt\" in the title, for instance.  ([Butt-calls aren't private if someone listens on the other end, court finds\n](http://money.cnn.com/2015/07/23/technology/butt-call-pocket-dial-case/))\n\n**Keyword research:**  If you don't know the right words, try using a thesaurus.  Or type related stuff into Google and let it give you suggestions.  You can type \"mars a\" \"mars b\" etc. to run through several suggestions.  \n\n\n",

If you have an exact phrase, put quotation marks around it. You have to think, if there was an article on the subject of this crazy theory in your head, what key words would it have in it, and what are some short generic phrases it might include? Keep any phrases short and simple. Ask yourself what the odds are that someone wrote those exact words in that order. Phrases longer than 2-3 words are not likely to give you results because then it starts to depend on people's writing styles or whatnot. \n\nOther tips are to use the advanced search tools. Like if you want something more recent, you can choose to search in time increments. Within the past year, for instance. You can choose to only show results from news sources, or scholarly journals, etc. If your search terms are similar to a music group and flooding your results, use the minus sign to eliminate specific words from your search results, but be sure that whatever word you eliminate is exclusive to the results you don't want. \n\nIt's trial and error. You have to try different combinations of search terms and tools until you start narrowing it down. If you try too hard to narrow it down when you first start your search, though, you might only be  narrowing it to having limited results to look through instead of bringing yourself closer to what you really want to find. \n\n",

    "body": "Yesterday, I was trying to find a quote I half-remembered by Vincent Baker, an independent tabletop RPG designer. This turns out to be pretty difficult though: he's not especially famous (outside of indie RPG design anyway), both his first and last name are pretty common, his writing shows up in several places, and I didn't remember the exact wording of the quote.\n\nSo here's more or less my process:\n\n1. First, always ask if your question is unambiguous and the sort of question where you'd expect a simple, well-documented answer? If so, then just use your question. *how old is Barack Obama* will work just fine. If that works, you're done. In this case *what did Vincent Baker say that one time* isn't going to get me anywhere.\n\n2. Your goal is now to try to come up with text that will appear in the answer to your question, **but not on other pages** (this is the part that a lot of people miss). In this case, my goal is to guess the text of the quote or text that will appear on the page with the quote I want, **but not on other pages**. *RPG* is a word that will probably be on the page I want, but it doesn't get me very far because it's going to be on millions of other pages. *Vincent Baker RPG* returns hundreds of thousands of pages, including thousands of postings by Vincent Baker as well as a ton of stuff that isn't by Vincent Baker. I'm not going to comb through that by hand.\n\n3. Now I start narrowing. The easiest thing to get rid of is all that stuff that isn't actually about Vincent Baker. Sorting through Vincent Baker's posts is going to be harder, but the first step is getting my search down to just Vincent Baker stuff.\n\n4. First, I change *Vincent Baker RPG* to *\"Vincent Baker\" RPG*. Vincent and Baker are both common names and I only care about them when they're together. The quotes also mean that pages have to have the quoted thing in them. I can get pages that don't have RPG in the results (**when unquoted, the words of your search are more like suggestions than requirements**), but I don't want pages without Vincent Baker.\n\n5. There's more than one Vincent Baker though, and I'm not actually sure the word RPG will show up in my results. So I skim the first page of results, and quickly click through to a handful of them. This is crucial: **look at the results to figure out what to change**. I discover a few useful things:\n\n  1. Vincent Baker posts under the handle \"lumpley\". I'm going to change my query to *\"Vincent Baker\" | lumpley RPG*. The | operator (this is shift+backslash, the key is right above or next to enter) means it's basically searching for two things at once: *\"Vincent Baker\" RPG* and *lumpley RPG*. You used to be able to use OR to do the same thing, but it looks like that just searches for the word *or* now, so use |.\n\n  2. His blog is called \"anyway\". This isn't very useful, since this is such a common word. But we can throw it into the query unquoted and it might help. So now we have: *\"Vincent Baker\" | lumpley RPG anyway*\n\n  3. It actually looks like he mostly just goes by Vincent. That's how people respond to him and it's the username he uses on his blog. I'm not going to change my search result though because I'm pretty sure the page I want will still have his full name on it somewhere, and just doing Vincent instead of \"Vincent Baker\" is going to get me a ton of crappy results (I just checked - it gives me pages on Vincent D'Onofrio, a book with a character named Vincent, and two medical advice articles by people named Vincent).\n\n  4. There's a lot of discussion of \"the Lumpley principle\". It's something he created, but I don't care about it. I'm looking for something he said, not people talking about a principle he created. I can get rid of that by changing my query: *\"Vincent Baker\" | lumpley RPG anyway -principle*. Putting a minus in front of something means you only want pages that don't have that word on them.\n\n6. My query is now *\"Vincent Baker\" | lumpley RPG anyway -principle*. The quote I'm interested in was one about the social structure of tabletop RPGs. I'm not sure what words he'd use to describe that, but I'll just start with *\"Vincent Baker\" | lumpley RPG anyway -principle social*.\n\n7. I quickly dig through the results again:\n\n  1. I remember that he goes by the username Vincent on his blog. When I look at the blog posts in the results, I ctrl+f \"Vincent said:\" so I can quickly single out his comments and skim through them.\n\n 2. One thing I quickly notice is that he really likes the word \"conversation\" when talking about this. The quote was about dialogue or conversation or social interaction, and knowing that he tends to use the word \"conversation\" for this helps me a lot. I change my search query from *\"Vincent Baker\" | lumpley RPG -principle social* to *\"Vincent Baker\" | lumpley RPG -principle conversation*. Skimming the new results, this looks like it's getting me a lot closer.\n\n8. From the results, I've now identified three different places the quote seems likely to be, and I know some things about each one:\n\n  1. His G+ page. It looks like he talks there a lot. I can search that specifically by adding site:plus.google.com to my query. I know a few things from skimming it too: I know he doesn't use the handle lumpley on it, so I can drop that part, and it isn't his blog, so I can drop the name of the blog too. So to search his G+, I'm going to go with *site:plus.google.com \"Vincent Baker\" RPG -principle conversation*.\n\n  2. His blog is lumpley.com, and every page will be his, so I don't need to worry about his username or anything else. I can just use *site:lumpley.com conversation*. One interesting thing is that I notice an actual index of his blog posts in the results. I spend a few minutes searching it with ctrl+f and skimming the sections to see if anything jumps out at me. A few things are close, but not quite what I'm looking for.\n\n  3. He did a couple of AMAs that have popped up. It turns out I don't even need to search these with google. I open one, look at his profile, and it turns out his only real Reddit activity is posting AMAs. So I can just skim through his posts (well, a combination of skimming and ctrl+f looking for likely words). Just like looking through his blog's index, it's useful to remember that you can make use of tools other than google while searching for something.\n\nIt turned out that one of the AMAs had the quote I wanted, so I'm done! In total, this probably took me around 10 or 15 minutes, most of it spent skimming pages to see if they had the quote/how to change my query.\n\n***\n\nSo my TL;DR general rules:\n\n1. Don't prematurely optimize. If you can get away with just asking google a question like your elderly parents who don't understand computers try to do, just do it. You don't need to get fancy for *how old is Barack Obama* (though you might do *Obama age* if you want to save yourself some typing).\n\n2. Your goal is to come up with words that will be on the page you want and **won't be on other pages**.\n\n3. The most useful operators are, in order of usefulness:\n\n  1. quotes (makes your search term a requirement - it must appear on the page for it to show up in the results - not a suggestion, and also lets you specify that words need to show up together and in a certain order)\n\n  2. minus (in order to show up in the results, the page must not have that word in it)\n\n  3. site: (searches only within the pages of the site you give it)\n\n  4. | (lets you specify alternatives - note that *John | Jack White* is like searching for *John White* and *Jack White* at once, if you want to search for *John* and *Jack White* at once, you need to use quotes like *John | \"Jack White\"*)\n\n  There are other operators. Sometimes they're useful, but these are useful by far the most often.\n\n4. Look at the results at each step to figure out what to do next. **Searching for difficult information is an iterative process.** This is especially useful for technical questions: try to use the results of your searches to figure out the technical terms involved and then search for those. Pages that know the technical terms and use them are more likely to know the answer to your technical question.\n\n5. Go wide before you go narrow. Once you're in the ballpark, you can start looking at the results and using the search operators, changing words, etc. in order to winnow the grain from the chaff. It's usually possible to go wide, then narrow down to what you want. It's usually impossible to go narrow, then widen it *just enough* to get what you want.\n\n5. Use the other tools at your disposal. Use site indexes, use ctrl+f, use references and links from Wikipedia pages, etc.",

    "body": "I hate to brag, but i'm known in my circles for being the go-to google search queen. And I love this stuff, it's like solving a challenging riddle and helping someone who's super frustrated at the same time :)\n\nSo, my method depends on many factors. Sometimes I'll use google images for a nonphoto-related search because the photos will give me an idea of the site's content. Image search is also great for uploading your image and looking for similar photos. \n\nSearch terms are important. Make sure to be as unambiguous as possible. Use the \"-\" sign before words you don't want to exclude them from a search results. This helps a lot when you can't think of a more specific search phrase but you're still getting top hits with some irrelevant bs in them paired with your desired search term. \n\nUse the 'news' drop down to filter blogs only. This helps when you're looking for reviews that aren't shill sites and peoples' personal accounts of experiences. \n\nWhen all hope is lost, post it to Reddit! I spent a day and a half searching for a particular brand of socks for my mom. I did all of the above, and no good. I had the picture of the logo, but google images didn't know what it was (results were rather silly actually: black sock with swirl logo gave me 'monochrome photography'). This reminds me of another tip: of you're uploading your pic to images, Google will give you a suggested search term based on what it is about the photo you're trying to search on. Change those terms to whatever it is in the pic that you meant for the engine to pick up on. \n\nUse filters in your search, such as 'site: www.reddit.com' and it will only search within that site. \n\nUse quotes around the phrase if you want the exact wording. Then deny and suggestions google makes for changes. Examine the blue text under the search bar to make sure google isn't automatically pulling up their suggestions. For example, if you're searching for \"Siam Street\", Google might say \"showing results for 'Sesame street'. Search 'Siam Street' instead?\" *Click*. \n\nFinally, if you're deep into the result pages and still see nothing, or even right from the start, search the page you're on for the phrase that says something like \"Showing most relevant results. Show all results instead?\" *Click*\n\nIf you're trying to find out if a phone caller is someone you know, or what business it is, enter the number into google and it'll often come up. \n\nIf you want tips on cyber stalking, it's a dif ball game and relatively basic. Ask and I'll tell. Don't want to waste any space here on that. \n\nI'll update if I think of anything else. If you have something specific you have in mind that you often search for and want tips on that, or even a hypothetical scenario, lmk. ",

Then, when OP doesn't respond they mark the thread as FIXED/SOLVED so poor bastards googling the same or similar issue will land there and find this completely worthless non-answer for the next 300 years since it's MS, they have enough servers to archive everything written and produced by every person through all of recorded history and then they take one of the top spots in all the google search results because of how their algorithm works.\n\nGets me riled up about as much as the teenagers in all the gaming forums who, for every game related problem, will ask OP what their temperatures are and if it's anything above 0 kelvin they will proclaim that the system is overheating and clearly that's the cause of the issue.

    "body": "Even if you bypass that crap by disabling the layers, it still just takes you to a page of their results that contains your result... somewhere.  It could be several page breaks and loads down, but it's supposedly somewhere. \n\nIf I find an image from pinterest I need, I just single click to where it shows the enlarged image with similar results, click \"search by image\" next to the image size, then click \"all sizes\" under find other sizes, and then browse the results until I find the original post which is usually in someone's blog.  That's only successful about 20% of the time and that figure is probably exaggerated towards success.  All of this is totally reasonable for a search process though. /s\n\nEdit: I feel like rambling about image searching.  If you really want to find a specific image, the method I described above will usually find the original location for you.  Obviously you like big pictures, so you want to use this trick to find the largest size.  It's a bonus that the largest tends to be the original; but not always, sometimes it'll have been enlarged and reposted in lesser quality.  That is what makes finding originals so troubling, but do your best.\n\nOnce you have found the original, you may not have actually found the largest size.  Lots of times images are stored on servers as larger original images and just shown in smaller sizes on the page.  Right click the thumbnail and click view image.  Search the address for things that look like dimensions and get to playing around with it.  If it says \\_s_ somewhere in there, try \\_o_ or \\_l_ (small, original and large respectively).  If it says \\_s1600_ or w=799 change those values to larger values and most of the time you hit enter with the resulting web address and you'll get the original size image.  With things like the w=799 example or 499x777, if they are at the end, just delete the dimensions all together and hit enter and you'll maybe be rewarded.\n\nInstagram is another beast altogether. This assumes you're using firefox. Right click the image and click view in new tab.  It should be on it's own page with it's comments and no other images.  Right click again and click view image info or view page info.  Select media at the top and then click the first file.  Go down the list with the arrow key until you find the image you want.  Right click the file and select copy.  Go back to your browser and open a new tab.  Right click the address bar and select paste and go.  Go to the end of the address, remove the dimensions and voila.  This trick also works for images that do not allow you to right click them or for images that do not allow you to select save image.  Fuck yeah!",
