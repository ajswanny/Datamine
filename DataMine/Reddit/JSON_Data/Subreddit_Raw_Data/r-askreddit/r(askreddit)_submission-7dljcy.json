    "body": "I wrote in about it and the senators in Utah believe government bad, business good. How should I respond?\nBelow is an email I received from senator Mike Lee's office:\nThank you for your letter regarding net neutrality. Senator Lee appreciates you taking the time to write in with your thoughts, and he has asked that I ensure you receive a response.\nSenator Lee believes the Internet is not broken and is one of the most productive and innovative sectors of our economy. This is because the government has consistently followed a hands-off approach. However, the past FCC tried to expand its authority so that it could regulate the Internet. This was its third attempt to pass so-called \u201cnet neutrality\u201d rules and regulations that would result in fewer Internet options, increased costs, and slower access to important services. If particular Internet service providers are engaged in anticompetitive behaviors that harm consumers and competition, our antitrust laws are there to stop that. It may be appropriate for Congress to review how those laws are being enforced in the Internet area. But it is certainly not in the best interest of consumers, for a 5-person unelected Commission to drastically alter the operation, maintenance, and accessibility of the Internet. This could in fact break the Internet. As the ranking member of the Antitrust Subcommittee, Senator Lee is dedicated to promoting a robust, competitive Internet market and will continue to monitor the actions taken by the FCC. I have shared your comments with the Senator, and he will continue to reflect on your words as he works to address this issue.\nSenator Lee places a high priority on constituent feedback and would encourage you to remain engaged in dialogue about the important issues facing Utah and our nation. You can do so by continuing to write or call into our office, learning more about his Article 1 Project, subscribing to Senator Lee\u2019s newsletter, following the Senator on social media, and by signing up for his tele-townhalls at this link or by texting \u201csenmikelee\u201d to 828282.\nBest regards,\n \nPete Blair\nOffice of Senator Michael S. Lee (202) 224-5444\n\nHow do I respond to this??",

They have taken our money and dragged their feet on installing new technology. They provide fast Internet to businesses because businesses demand it and are willing to pay their high prices, passing the costs on to us as customers. The people that are supposed to be representing our interests in government have undergone an almost complete regulatory capture by the Big Telcos, so they have let them get away with murder.\n\nComcast, AT&T, and Time Warner have simply been pocketing billions of dollars given to them by the federal and state governments on the promise that they'll modernize infrastructure, but then they never do. This is a clear example of trickle-down economics in action\u2013they promise to invest in their business and expand access for all, they get the money, and then they use a small bit of it to lobby Congress to let them slide on the delivery.\n\nIf you think this only applies to big cities, you're wrong. There are many, many small cities across the country that have already opted out of this nonsense and built their own networks.\n\n* [Sandy, Oregon residents pay $60/month](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBztjr2uCzg) for gigabit fiber to the home service\n* [Chelan County, Washington](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQ0EovEe0DA) has had gigabit speeds since 2006\n* [Longmont, Colorado](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiSaMQcogG4) has their own residential fiber network\n\nIn all of these cases **these are profitable operations**. At the rates we currently pay to Comcast and other nightmare companies with terrible customer service, these places have been able to invest in their own municipally owned infrastructure and pay for it and use the proceeds to reduce local fees and taxes\u2013they are **making money** off this business.\n\nWe are getting screwed for decades.

The frequency and potency of contact just isn't there. Also their races are crazy expensive so they have to pander to those corporation$$$. So they'd ask the other, more local candidates what people were actually concerned about. Weird right? \n\nMy point: write everyone. Write your Senators and your Reps, but also your state-level candidates and senators and reps. Tell others to do the same. Eventually it will filter up. A state party telling a national Senator \"hey, people are actually pretty riled up about this\" can work just as well if not better than letters directly to the Senator.\n\nedit to clarify: definitely still write the national candidates. write everyone. \n\n",

Some of the issues the parties push aren't actually all that important and aren't actually all that actionable.

If we get mail from outside the district, it gets rerouted to your Rep as well.\n\nIn terms of lying about where you live, I'm not sure it's a *crime*, per se, but we'd definitely get suspicious if you give us an address that doesn't exist. Overall, I'd highly recommend against it. The only people whose time you're wasting is your own and whatever poor unpaid intern is reading/listening to whatever you're saying.\n\nI would, however, highly encourage you (and everyone in this thread) to reach out to your elected officials - Representatives and Senators - and tell them your views. You are their boss. Calling/emailing/sending mail/faxing (yes, we still get faxes) really does make a difference when it happens in enough volume. Please, please contact your reps - not just on this, but on anything you care about.\n\nOh, and pro tip: check what district you're in on the House website *before* you call, especially if you're in a highly gerrymandered state.

    "body": "Net neutrality, in my opinion, is a bit of a misnomer. I think the name confuses people on what it actually is. Net neutrality is the act of keeping the internet neutral. Some people use the term data equality which is better I think. Basically, if we didn't have net neutrality, ISPs would be able to control and throttle data based on what that data is. So say they see that Netflix users are a large portion of their data consumption. They can throttle, or slow down internet speeds towards Netflix to the point where it becomes unusable and hold Netflix for ransom. The ISPs can then go to Netflix and say, \"Hey Netlflix, people won't be able to use you unless you give us a buttload of cash.\" At that point Netflix would HAVE to pay them a large sum because they are dependent on usable data speeds. Now, in theory, with a capitalist society, net neutrality shouldn't be a huge issue. If there were a variety of internet service providers, ISPs, you could say, okay well ISP A is throttling my internet I'll just go to ISP B. The problem is that internet is a huge monopoly, especially by Comcast, because it's really difficult to lay down wires connecting to every home. Without neutrality, in addition to internet monopolies, our data usage will not be chosen by us, but rather be chosen for us. When talking to a friend of mine, we got into a heated debate on WHY no net neutrality would be bad. He thinks that control over data from ISP's would make it so the ISP can charge the consumer for access to websites. I don't know if that's a possibility or not, if it is, I don't really think that's likely to happen. They'll go to the big companies that require data and hold them for ransom. If the companies don't comply, the average user won't know what happened. Instead they'll just think, \"Oh Netflix is just really slow now, but Hulu is really fast. It's not my internet, it's just Netflix.\" The lobbying against net neutrality is just a move for big companies to get bigger. It does not benefit citizens at all whatsoever.

Even if the end-user cooks up their own device from scratch in their dorm room or garage (Ex; You, Me, Steve Wozniak), as long as it follows relevant Industry Standards and Protocols and it does not harm the network, the ISP shall not interfere. So, if you think you have the chops to build a better, more capable DOCSIS 3.1/DSL/ISDN/Satellite transceiver device, well, by all means, GO FOR IT!\n* **Thou shalt not block or limit Networked devices \u2014** A network operator (ISP) may not block or limit what devices an end-user may choose to connect to the Internet *via their Access Device*. This means they cannot limit or block your use of Computers, TVs, Gaming systems (XBox, Playstation, etc), \"Internet of Things\" devices like cameras, a fridge or coffee pot, iVibrator, VR-Group-Sexerator or anything else imagined or as yet *unimagined.*\n* **Thou shalt route \"Best Effort\" \u2014** An ISP or network operator should route traffic on a \"Best Effort\" basis without prejudice or undue favoritism towards certain types of traffic (***especially for a consideration or renumeration from others***). This does not exclude Industry Standard network management and Quality of Service  practices and procedures. It means **DON'T BE AN ASSHOLE, COMCAST**. Get ALL the data where it needs to go as quickly and efficiently as possible.\n* **Thou shalt not block or limit Protocols** \u2014 An ISP may NOT tell you that you cannot run BitTorrent; or mine BitCoin; or run a WWW server; or a (v)Blog; or a music streaming server so that you can access your Polka collection from anywhere in the world; or run your own customized email server; or a gaming server; or host your security cameras/BabyCam so that grandma in Cincinnati can peek in on her little darling anytime, anywhere; or maybe host **The Next Big Thing\u2122** you dreamed up while masturbating in the shower.\n* **Thou shalt not block or limit Services** \u2014 An ISP may NOT limit what services you may host or access on your Internet connection. Like Twitter or Facebook, when your government has gone to shit. Or Netflix, because your ISP has arbitrarily decided it has become \"too popular\" and they want to get their money-grubbing hands in on the action. Or stop you from becoming a Tor node, etc, etc.\n* **Thou shalt not Snoop on data** \u2014 An ISP may NOT snoop on data streams or packet payloads (I.E; Deep Packet Inspection) for reasons other than Industry Standard Network Management routines and procedures. No snooping on what an end-user does with their Internet connection. No building up of databases of browsing history or \"Consumer Habits\" for data mining for advertising or other purposes. ISP's are a critical trusted partner in the Internet ecosystem and should strive for network-level data anonymity. An ISP should never undermine whatever level of anonymity an end-user strives to create for themselves.\n* **Thou shalt not Molest data** \u2014 An ISP may NOT intercept and modify data in-transit except for Industry Standard Network Management routines and procedures.\n\n\\# | Example\n---|---\n1 | Snooping on an end-user's data streams and replacing ads on web pages mid-stream with the ISP's/affiliates own advertising is expressly VERBOTEN. ***(Fuck You,  [CMA Communications and r66t.com](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/04/how-a-banner-ad-for-hs-ok/))***\n2 | Snooping on an end-user's data streams so-as to [interject Pop-up ads](http://www.perftech.com/#home) to be rendered by the end-users browser is expressly VERBOTEN. ***(Fuck You, Comcast and your \"Data Cap\" [warning messages](http://i.imgur.com/35HG6U5.jpg))***\n3 | Future Ex; An ISP snooping on 20,000,000 subscriber's data streams to see who \"e-Votes\" on some initiative (like, say, Net Neutrality! or POTUS) so the ISP can change the vote in the ISP's favor should be expressly VERBOTEN ***now***, not later.\n\nThe FCC's existing Bright-line Rules address a number of these principles,\n\n* No Blocking: broadband providers may not block access to legal content, applications, services, or non-harmful devices.\n* No Throttling: broadband providers may not impair or degrade lawful Internet traffic on the basis of content, applications, services, or non-harmful devices.\n* No Paid Prioritization: broadband providers may not favor some lawful Internet traffic over other lawful traffic in exchange for consideration \u2013 in other words, no \u201cfast lanes.\u201d  This rule also bans ISPs from prioritizing content and services of their affiliates.\n\n---\nThose are the main ISP-centric Net Neutrality Principles. There are many more. For example, there are guidelines for ***Service*** providers, like Netflix, Google, Reddit, you-name-it. Such as,\n\nThou shalt not block or limit speech  \nThou shalt not block or limit based upon race, religion, creed, etc, etc.  \n",

    "body": "Instead of mass writing our senators/congressmen, what about mass writing to Facebook, Google, Netflix, Twitter, Wikipedia?\n\nWe need a collective effort - if I write my senator and you write your senator, each senator gets 1 message. If, instead, we each write to the CEO of Google, he gets 2 messages. Multiply this times 350,000 and our effect is much greater when focused on a few, but highly influential, targets than if we piecemeal our power.\n\nAlso, I think Netflix should be the main focus. It's one thing to shut down Wikipedia for a day.  Imagine if Netflix went down on a Sunday and, instead, would play only a brief video explaining, in layman's terms, what net neutrality is, it's effect, that it's motivated solely by greed and, if net neutrality is gutted, your Netflix experience will change, your right to an open internet will disappear and, with it, a piece of your freedom as an American.\n\nI'm not tech-savvy. I know that a ddos attack shuts down a website (that's the beginning and end of everything I know about ddos).\nI don't know how to make the video I described (I can't even figure out Photoshop), I can't explain net neutrality and, after two years of massive frustration, I still can't get my own website to work.  I don't know a lot about how the internet works but I know net neutrality is absolutely critical.  \n\nIf I feel like my rights are being taken away, how are you guys not feeling like Verizon is about take away your entire livelihood? A war is a series of battles.  It's taken a lot but we've won every one of those battles so far; if we give up now, we automatically lose the war.\n\nI can't do anything tech related so I'm using my voice and my ideas.  Not only do you guys know how to do all of the things I've mentioned, Redditors are the most brilliant tech people on the planet.  \n\nIt's FCC v Reddit and, with or without you guys, there's no way in hell I'm going down without a fight!\n\nEdit: spelling",

The fine print of your service will limit / block you on tethering (if it\u2019s allowed at all).\n\nBut even fixed line ISPs can slow down traffic if they are clear about it (Virgin Media have the right  to and have done in the past (refuse to use them to know if they still do) slow down BitTorrent traffic if they want.\n\nThis is they you started seeing more \u201ctotally unlimited\u201d in ISPs advertising as some ISPs won\u2019t slow you down or limit your usage. \n\nThe governments stance on the matter is as long as their are ISPs that are \u201ctotally unlimited\u201d, the ones who aren\u2019t are clear about how they are not to customers then they do not yet need to step in and regulate.",

Look at the voting records for the last, what, eight times(?) net neutrality has come up--with the exception of a handful of Congresspersons, the Democrats have consistently voted to protect net neutrality while the Republicans have consistently voted to do away with it. There is a chance that you could be in a district where both the possible Democrat and Republican up for election are not in favor of net neutrality, but by the numbers it's a statistically small chance and it's more likely that people are just parroting the idea that both parties are the same on all the important issues because they're either too damn lazy to do their own research, or because they feel they need to justify their apathy toward participate in our democracy in any meaningful way.",

Missouri is single license (meaning one license allows a company to install infrastructure anywhere in the state). There are almost no access fees and saturation isn't required, so they can offer their service piecemeal.\n\nYes, Google definitely was looking for lower levels of regulation.  By creating public excitement for their product, they convinced cities that having Google Fiber would be worth more to the city than the money they receive from incumbents.  \n\n> Even before Google Fiber, there were half a dozen different ISPs in KC offering competitive options at reasonable prices. Now, there are nearly a dozen options in many places in the metro, and half a dozen offering fiber.\n\nI think most of these are resellers.

Most people are on the same freeway, but it's speed limit 30 instead of 65.  If you pay extra, you can get speed limit 45, and pay even more you can get speed limit 65.  A few people pay even more and get their own super special lane.  This is actually your lane, but if they want to drive, you get moved automatically to a slower lane until they pass you and then you're allowed to use the lane you're paying for again.\n\nOh yeah, and if your car wasn't made by the company that owns the toll road, you always drive slower.\n\nlastly, some of the exits require special permits, so you can't just take the internet toll road to whatever website you want.  Instead you have to pay $5 a month to be able to access social media exists, or $2 a month for search engines that aren't Bing, or $25 a month for the privilege of paying HBo another $15 a month to stream HBO.\n\nDoes that help?",

You either have the government setting laws or repealing laws based on lobbyists, or you have a laissez-faire where corporations can do whatever they want and we just hope they don\u2019t do shady stuff (because there will be people that buy products even if they are made unethically, or there is something unethical about them; see Electronic Arts and it\u2019s gambling loot boxes and the people buying their games without even batting an eye at it as a modern day example). Either we need to fix it, or replace it.",
