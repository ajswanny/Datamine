Pascal's principles of hydrostatics are actually the science behind hydraulic lifts. \n\nThink of a tube of fluid in the shape of a U. On one end there's an opening with a large surface area with a moveable platform on top. On the other end there's a similar platform with a much smaller surface area. Because the pressure in the fluid at both openings is equal, you can apply a small force on the small opening and the resulting force on the large end will be proportional to the surface area! You can use this to lift very heavy things with a smaller amount of force. [Nifty.](http://www.smithshydraulic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/hydraulic_lift.jpg)",

As a skeptic (who still adheres to a personal sort of nature based spirituality) the idea of believing in the Christian God for fear of the consequences of being wrong just strikes me as disingenuous. If God exists and doesn't want to spare someone who spends their life trying to make the world a better place but happens to be the wrong religion, then I don't want to spend eternity with such a God.\n\nMoreover, the time I would spend believing in that specific manifestation of God could be better spent trying to better this world. In spite of Pascal's statement that you lose.nothing for believing, I see it as losing valuable time in church each week when I could be volunteering for a good cause instead.\n\nETA: I derped. Did not realize it was the same Pascal. Next thing you'll be telling me he was also a lizard ;)",

If you apply 1N of force at the narrower end, by placing a load on top of the piston, then a total force of 10N is transmitted through the liquid spread over the entire area of the other larger piston. The larger piston would support a load of 10N! It's a force multiplier. That's pretty awesome actually. \n",

In order to determine between the two, consider the following options:\n\n**Solvent**\n\nSn2 reactions are best supported by polar aprotic solvents such as DMSO.  If you see something like that, it's probably Sn2.\n\n**Configuration**\n\nSn2 mechanisms favor leaving groups that are on primary carbons.  If you see a leaving group on a tertiary carbon, it cannot go Sn2 due to steric hindrance.\n\n**Temperature**\n\nHot temperatures tend to favor elimination reactions, whereas cold temperatures tend to favor substitution.  Use this to your advantage.\n***\nFor E1 and Sn1, a good leaving group is absolutely necessary as the first step of your mechanism will be the leaving group leaving on its own.  To determine between the two, look at the reagent.  Strong bases tend to favor elimination, nucleophiles tend to favor substitution.\n\nHope this helps!",

Me, I personally prefer the ThunderTrumpet which is a large hole dug into the cracked and parched surface of what was one The City. Using ancient techniques of plumbing lost to time during the Ascension in 2016, we've managed to not only survive but thrive underground with a steady supply of shit from Designated Streets being pooled to create a YUUGE methane reservoir. \n\nIn times of turmoil, when the Underground of The City is Threatened, we'll load about 90kg of decomposed fecal matter and razor sharp swarf into a ball or \"fustercluck\". In the dystopian future, you see, without health care the real killer is infection. And what we do is roll these balls into the ThunderTrumpet tubes and fire them at speed into the enemy where they disperse into 300 meter sharp poop clouds, which in addition to the imminent death by poopy infection also really grosses the enemy out.",

There are a few key trends you're going to have to recognize, but once you've got those trends down all the reactions will fall into different patterns.\n\nTrying to remember every single reaction is how you fail organic chemistry, as it's borderline impossible, and the professor can always just twist the example in some weird way that makes the memorization almost useless.  Learn the rules and apply them.\n\nMain rules are being able to recognize a stable cation or anion, identifying whether or not a hydrogen will be acidic or not, identifying the electrophillic and nucleophilic sites, etc.",

They never clandestinely bought accounts to send subliminal messages or sway votes on forums.

Step 1) A constant heat expansion Step 2) a no heat exchange expansion Step 3) a constant temperature compression Step 4) a no heat exchange compression\n\nThis is the basics to 1 type of carnot engine. There are many variations, but the basic idea is that you take a HOT heat flow in through step 1, have a COLD heat sink so HOT flows from step 1 to step 2 to create WORK. Work is created by transferring energy. In a carnot engine it is the hot flow getting colder. The colder it gets the more work you can get out of an engine (adiabatic expansion drops the temperature). This leads us to step 3 where the temperature has dropped forcing the volume to shrink (look up a video of putting a balloon into liquid nitrogen cold = smaller volume). And finally step 4 where adiabatic compression heats up the flow (opposite to expansion) Leading us back to step 1. \n\nThe cycle is meant to have a constant flow of heat in and out to form work. A car piston is a great example. In real life no carnot engines work perfectly and that the work generated is entirely based on the efficiency of the engine.",
