Well,my teacher gave us 5 mins to come up with a dance to a whole song,and you'd have to dance in front of the class alone. I noped the fuck out of there and ran and hid in the bathroom. My cell phone was still in the classroom,but at that point I didn't care. I decided to sneak out the front door of the studio. Well there's a small problem there. The walkway to the parking lot was in front of the giant windows of my classroom. I decided to just duck down and run the best I could,hoping no one saw me. I made it to the car and had my Dad run in and get my phone. Didn't go back to my class for a few weeks there.",

    "body": "The other day at my small office I went to the bathroom to fix my shirt which I had worn inside out. When I went into the stall the bathroom was empty. As I flipped my shirt around someone walked into the stall next to me. I also used some toilet paper to wipe my nose (slight cold) and dropped the paper in the bowl. This triggered the auto flush sensor and it flushed. My predicament began when I realized I also had to pee, but since I had already used TP and flushed my twisted mind decided this would seem really weird to the person next door. \"Why would someone use the bathroom, flush... and then stand up and pee again?\" said no one ever... But I couldn't, they might recognize my shoes and know who I was.  \n  \n  \nSo instead I hatched a clever deception. I left the stall and washed my hands to seem normal, despite that I hadn't even used ths bathroom. After drying I walked loudly to the exit and opened the door into the hall, then I said \"oh excuse me\" like I had accidentally bumped into someone else coming in, and walked right back in. I made sure to change the sound of my footsteps walking more quietly so that stall-man would think I was a different person and not some freak playing bathroom charades. Then I went to the urinal and peed and then washed my hands again, using the farthest sink so he couldn't spot my shoes.",

As I was leaving that area this guy and girl around my age were coming into the electronics area. They saw me and both enthusiastically said \"Hey!!\" like they were happy and surprised to see me. I didn't recognize them but I thought maybe we had a class together or something so I was like \"Hey!! How's it going?!\" feigning cheerfulness as I tried to place where I knew them from. They both looked at me weird and made a face then walked past me to a guy and girl behind me, greeting them. \n\n\nI was so embarrassed and anxious I just got out of the electronics department as fast as I could without running and went to the next department over... which ended up being ladies clothing, the bra and panty area. A female employee came over and asked if I needed help, looking at me confused because of the department. I was flustered and said, \"Sorry just trying to find electronics\" to which she replied \"Oh it's over this way come with me\". I didn't want to go back but now I was obligated so I followed her back and as we approached I saw the two teens i had the awkward interaction with and their two friends all look up and stare at me. \"There ya go hun\" the employee said then she started chatting with the cashier in electronics. \n\nAt that time Walmart's electronics section was like a big square with only one opening for entrance and exit go deter theft so now I'm trapped in this area with the people I just had the awkwardness with and the employee that just escorted me from women's clothes. I was so embarrassed and my whole body felt hot from anxiety. I just blankly stared at the videogames behind the glass until the other people left and then I took off. \n\nUgh.. \n\nEdit: Thank you stranger for the gold and the pity! Thank you all for sharing in my pain, giving me your support and letting me know this story made you laugh! I can't believe how popular this post became but I'm glad some of you got some joy out of my teenage awkwardness. \n\nEdit 2: To those who have mentioned it, yes I'm much better about stuff like this now. I can just say \"Oops, thought you meant me\" and laugh it off. This story hurts because when I think about it I can **feel** how I felt back then and it makes me cringe. ",

I spent a lot of that time going from bathroom to bathroom, kind of just standing there waiting for time to pass. \n\nPeople keep asking these questions so here are the answers:\n\nI didn't actually go in the library because I didn't want to spend my free time studying (I wasn't a huge fan of school in the first place.) Sneaking around was honestly more appealing to me. \n\nWe didn't have lunch together because there were too many students to have them all in the cafeteria at once, so lunch was broken up into 4 mini periods. Some kids ate lunch while the others were still in class and rotated in and out of the cafeteria. That's why we weren't allowed to roam the halls.\n\nThanks for the concern but I wasn't a super sad kid back then or anything, and I'm totally fine now!\n\nNo, I'm not you. ",

I've gotten much better in the last year, but I'm still not great now, so I was awful back when this happened, a few years ago.\n\nI was visiting my gf in college for the weekend (her first year, I was a senior in high school). Anyways we'd been having fun that day, getting slurpies from the neighboring 7/11, other fun... (*wink*)\n\nAs the day went on though, she had class, and I elected to stay in her room and hang. Now, she had a single dorm, but how that works is there's this shared living room thing connecting several individual rooms, so you sorta halfway have roommates, and there's a shared, multi-toilet bathroom connected to the main room too. Anyway, sitting in the room for hours (her art class was really long), I eventually needed to pee. But all of the other occupants were hanging out and talking loudly in the main room. I was way too scared to go through them to the bathroom without my gf, as it felt awkward to have some rando walk through. I tried to wait, but it went on for two hours before I couldn't hold it. I freaked out and decided to pee into my empty slurpie cup, fill it with tissues so it couldn't spill out, put it by my gf's trash, and get rid of it later. That being said, I was beyond embarrassed and really upset, and in my freak out began to cry out of emotional overload and shame.\n\nSo eventually she comes back to find me on the floor, crying of shame, with a slurpie cup full of tissues and pee. Luckily she gets it and felt super bad for me, cause she's the greatest.\n\nTLDR; staying in gf's dorm, too afraid to walk through people to the bathroom so I peed in a slurpies cup and cried about it until she came home.",

Even when someone got off he slowly looked at the newly emptied bench but remained standing, glancing back at it every so often. \n  \nI knew exactly what he's thinking. \"Will people judge me for sitting down on my own now after standing for so long? Yeah, better stay standing so it looks intentional, like I want to be standing.\" NO YOU IDIOT, THAT'S WHAT'S MAKING ME JUDGE YOU. JUST SIT DOWN AND BE CONFORTABLE, LITERALLY NO ONE CARES. \n  \nnot even uncommon, I see similar behavior weekly.  \n  \nEdit: For the folks saying \"But you cared, that's why we're anxious\" - I only remembered this guy because he stuck to the awkward behaviour. If he'd just sat down like a normie I'd have already forgotten him. He created what he was anxious about... By being anxious about it. It's like a dog biting you because it can sense you're afraid of being bitten. I'll admit the reason I pick up on this behaviour is because I used to suffer from (regular) anxiety, but I recovered when I progressively realized that 9/10 times it was just me being in my own head causing the problems - nobody really gives a damn what I'm doing and 30 seconds after I leave everyone who saw me has already forgotten I existed.",

    "body": "Throwaway time!\n\nI had Asperger's when I was a kid. I guess I still have it, but it's barely noticeable now. It was bad back then. Along with the Asperger's came very strong social anxiety. \n\nThe school I was at didn't quite know what to do with me, because I could do the work well, but I was being bullied badly. So they decided to send me on what we called work experience. I'm not sure if this is a thing these days, or if it ever was in the USA (I'm from another country). It's a couple of weeks in a year where, instead of going to school, you do what's basically a short internship somewhere. It's to give you a taste for how the world works after school. They sent me off for work experience for what ended up being three months. They just kept sending me back out to different stores once I'd completed the weeks at one place. \n\nAnyway, at the first place I was too anxious to ask to go to the bathroom until I was in pain from not going. By that point I'd pissed myself a little. Once the wet spot got larger than about an inch or two across the front of my pants I'd ask to go. But before then I'd duck down between the aisles of this electronics store and check. I'd examine my crotch, feel the wetness, and sometimes even smell it (I don't know why). \n\nOne day the manager called me into his office. He chatted with me for a bit. Then he pointed to the CCTV screens above his desk. \n\n\"See those? Pretty cool, hey? On these I can see *everything that goes on in my store*. Anyway, catch you later. See me if you need anything.\"\n\nGuess what? It wasn't until years later that I realized he was subtly explaining that he could see me checking my pants every day. I mean, subtle social interactions weren't exactly my strong point. Programming computers was, but that wasn't much help here. Pretty cringey moment when I realized he could see me the whole time and, not only that, but after he nicely tried to tell me this, I just kept doing what I was doing. ",

For whatever reason, I thought the proper way to get his attention was to rudely interrupt their conversation by screaming across the room and saying to his friend \"Hey you! stop talking\". I did the stop sign hand gesture to her. And then I proceeded to ask my coworker a question, all with an awkward cocky smile and everything. They both looked so confused, but my coworker decided to answer my question instead of calling me out for being rude. *phew*. I even knew at the time, what I did was awkward, but I just didn't know how to express myself, and even my body language was wrong.

If it got too bad, I'd ask to go out for a smoke break, which my manager was very cool with. I mainly am just very awkward with small talk. A lot of my job was helping customers, talking to people that seemed lonely or needed it, and just being kind. I loved helping people and actually had customers ask about me frequently, which always made my day. They'd even give me gifts on holidays.. I fucking loved our regulars. \n\nBut anyway, one slow day, I started talking myself up in my head. I wanted to try to improve my small talk and be nice. I had skimmed through the news paper earlier and saw one of our regulars had died. It didn't say the reason why he passed, but he'd always been very sweet to me, so I was genuinely sad. I'd already had a few customers bring it up, since everyone knew it, but one woman... was insanely rude about the deceased. She told me what a horrible person he was, that he'd died of syphilis from cheating on his wife. People can be rude, so I just brushed it off.\n\nSo, fast forward a few hours and this sweet, but quiet, little older lady comes in. I try to strike up a conversation about the weather, but she's not very receptive, so I start feeling my anxiety hit. I still don't know why... but I brought up the death I read in the newspaper. The conversations from earlier popped into my head. Anxiety, stupidity, and word vomit.. I don't know. She gave me this look which, for whatever fucking reason, made me stutter out, \"Yeah, I heard he died of syphilis from cheating on his wife.. Terrible way to go.\" Just anxious word vomit spilling from my mouth.\n\nGod, i instantly wanted to bash my head against the register repeatedly. Why the fuck did I just spout that bullshit rumor? But before I could even apologize or react.. She tears up. I freeze. Fuck. I felt ice cold panic bubbling up. She starts sobbing and screams, \"Fuck everyone in this town! My husband was a good man. It was brain cancer! Fucking brain cancer!!!\" My heart was pounding, a full blown panic attack coming on, and I couldn't physically make myself say anything. Couldn't apologize or explain. I just stared in shock. She storms out, and I went and hid in the bathroom and cried for thirty minutes.\n\nOut of everyone in my town of 6000 fucking people, I managed to find and talk shit about the deceased to his goddamn widow out of  anxiety.. The ONE time I try to direct conversation. I still feel sick thinking about it. I'm a terrible person and have never tried to make small talk again.\n\nTL;DR: Read one of my regular customers died. Tried to make small talk to improve my social skills. Ended up spouting a stupid rumor to his widow about him dying of syphilis. She had a breakdown and I cried in the bathroom.",

Got flustered and tried to backtrack by saying \"...erm I mean sibling... I'm a relative\" *FUUUCCCK. GET A GRIP YOU PRICK*\n\nBecause I'd made the mistake and got flustered. I repeated it about four times that afternoon topping it off my saying \"I'm Vicky' s sister...\" *shit* \"...I mean she is my brother\"",

This is the one thing that has really truly helped me. Social anxiety makes you the center of the world and is a bit narcissistic in that way, but people are self-centered and truly don't care about what you do, and that's a good thing. \n\nI've also gotten so much better with strangers in general because even if I do something stupid that I wake up in a sweat about 10 years later, that person doesn't know me and I probably won't see them again, so even if they are telling that story of when I fell on the treadmill while it was still running and scraped my palms and knees to hell, it doesn't affect me. But they probably aren't telling people because after a day or two it doesn't matter anymore. \n\nIt's made it so much easier and sort of freed me from a prison of my brain. Even without all the dumb (but totally normal) things people did in this post, social anxiety always made me feel stiffer, made it difficult to smile (I never knew why?) and overall just made me seem weirder, which was obviously off putting to people.\n\nI still struggle in that awkward phase of kind of knowing someone but not being close to them because I can't just think they don't care or I'll never see them again, but it's a work in progress.\n\nAlso, if you just go somewhere in the public with a lot of people and observe, you will see people do all kinds of dumb stuff and it's really nothing. Like it might feel awkward to realize you're going the wrong way so you stop abruptly and turn around, but the first time I noticed someone doing that, it was kind of freeing. They didn't look like some crazy weirdo, they were just a person who realized they were going the wrong way. \n\nEdit: I know everyone hates the thanks for the gold edits, but thanks for the gold stranger! It's my first! It's also makes me feel good that it was on this because it maybe makes me feel like I'm working in the right direction. ",
