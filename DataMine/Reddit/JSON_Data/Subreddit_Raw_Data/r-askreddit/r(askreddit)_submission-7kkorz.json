    "body": "Over the space of three days, an estimated 165 people survived both the Hiroshima and Nagasaki nuclear bomb attacks. \n\nTsutomu Yamaguchi is one of the more famous ones, who was only two miles from ground zero when the bomb was dropped on Hiroshima. It hit when he was walking to work on the last day of a work trip. After he heard the drone of a plane, he looked up at it and the sky lit up. He was then plucked from the ground, spun around and tossed into a nearby potato field.\n\nMiraculously he survived, despite being covered in burns, soaked in radiation, and with two blown ear drums. He spent a night in an air shelter then took an overnight sleeper train home to Nagasaki to see his family. When he made it to a hospital in Nagasaki he was so burnt a childhood friend didn\u2019t recognise him. Neither did his family.\n\nDespite his wounds he made it to work the next day. He started giving his boss a rundown on what happened, and his boss thought he was crazy. There was no way one bomb could destroy a city. Suddenly, a bright light lit up the room. He panicked and dropped to the floor of the office seconds before the shock wave smashed out the office windows. He had just been hit twice by a nuclear blast in the space of three days.\n\nAt the age of 93 he was given the title \u201cnijyuu hibakusha\u201d, or twice bombed person. He died the next year.\n\nSo next time you think you\u2019re having a shitty week at work... yeah.\n\n[This article is a good one on him](http://www.history.com/news/the-man-who-survived-two-atomic-bombs) ",

Given that the president must be 35 years old, and the oldest president was 70 years old when he took office, there is a maximum possible span of 83 years of birth years between them. So, choosing 8 out of 83, you might expect the occasional repeat decade. But between the eight of them, there are only five birth years: 1911 (Reagan), 1913 (Nixon, Ford), 1924 (Carter, H.W. Bush), 1946 (W. Bush, Clinton, Trump) and 1961 (Obama), In the 36 preceding presidents there are only two pairs with the same birth year, 1822 (Grant, Hayes) and 1767 (Jackson, Adams)",

Like, i know its semantics, but if we we're to tavel to the first micro instant of the universe light would get us from one side to the other almost instantly. Light was pretty big shit on day 1 of the universe. \n\nbut then a few Seconds pass and now light maybe takes a few seconds to traverse. Still easy. \n\nBut after, a few billion  years of stellar expansion later, and light has to put on its trekking shoes just to make it from its source, to the nearest celestial body. Light is basically suffering hard from cosmic inflation. 1 light year just doesn't buy what it used to. His purchasing power is shot. \n\nJoking aside, let me get all sappy and dweeby for a second: For as slow as light seems, it still reaches out to illuminate those farthest and darkest corners of the universe, far beyond what has ever been seen by living eyes. And yes, if we can only move as fast as light. it may take thousands of years for humans to reach one end of the galaxy to the other, but honestly... isn't that kind of exciting? \n\nThere's eons of exploration out there. that means that for hundreds, or thousands, perhaps millions, of generations of humans we'll have new frontiers to explore. We couldn't rush to explore it all in a few days, even if we wanted. Its the greatest adventure available. \n\nSo, worst case scenario, let's say that this is it, that our universe, massive in its stature, unfathomable in its complexity, is the last thing we could ever possibly explore. Let's say it truly is the final frontier. What an epic final frontier it is. I know it sounds corny, but when i think about how big it is im equal parts helpless as i am hopeful.\n\n",

V:tM has a pretty biblical timeline, where in the \"first city\" before the biblical flood, the vampires basically ruled everyone. Infighting between the vampires, mainly, ended up screwing everything up.\n\nThen thousands of years later, vampires got fairly viciously sodomized by humanity during the inquisition. Turns out if the peasantry all rise up, kill anyone who has anything to do with you, hunt you down during the day using fire because they know your strengths and weaknesses due to superstition... You're going to have a bad time.\n\nPlus in V:tM, standard crosses, holy water and etc are normally useless. But a person who truly believes (called True Faith in game) can make those things lethal to vampires, or if they're enough of a zealot they can actively repel vampires just from being around them - hurt them just by touching them, etc. Back in the glorious Dark Ages the True Faith thing was way more common, but is near non-existent in the modern setting.\n\nSo during the whole Inquisition thing, huge portions of the young (in vampire terms) vampires all got murdered by humans, older ones had their entire power base destroyed and had to go into hiding, and the really ancient ones were mostly sleeping. It also coincided with a big civil war between two groups that would eventually break off into full blown factions with opposing morality/views/etc in the modern setting.",
