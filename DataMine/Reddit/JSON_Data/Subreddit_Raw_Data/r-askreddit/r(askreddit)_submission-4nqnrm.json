The Pulse Orlando Facebook page provides a lot of info in the comments-  below a comment from the page\n\n \"\"There was a shooter with an assault rifle who shot up the people in the club sometime around 2am. The club is reported to have been at full capacity.  The shooter has himself barricaded inside Pulse with multiple hostages. This is per a private source.  Initial assessment and estimate was at least 20 red tagged patients per OFD.  They are prepared to take 20 trauma alerts at ORMC. Yellow and green tag patients will be welcome at florida hospital east.  Florida hospital orlando has taken on two red tags so far.  They have reached out to seminole fire and rescue and placed their units on standby. Orlando sounds like they are charge.  They just made ballistic vests available to the fire and ems first responders in the red zone. The walking wounded are walking to a treatment area behind Einstein bagels.   All that info is from a police scanner. And being updated as it happens.\n\n3:23. Active fired shots outside ORMC.\n3:24. The shooter at ORMC is inside the hospital. They can no longer take any pts. The shooter is locked inside ORMC.\n3:27 three MORE trauma alerts\n3:28 ORMC is no longer on lockdown. They are requested ONLY trauma alerts now.  No walking wounded will be there. ONLY trauma alerts.\n3:34 they reached 250 victims\n3:39 i think they just said they have transported all patients and are waiting to hear from the interior of the structure\n3:50 they are having to pull OPD to a large gathering at Columbia.  Everyone get back in your houses.  Go home.  You are pulling resources for selfish reasons. \n3:56 they requested one more transport. So they have one more patient. It has really slowed down though. They just told someone to stage. \n4:19 they are being told they are expecting more patients who might be coming out right now. \n4:23 there are 8 patients coming out\n4:24 they are not tagged yet. They just know they have 8 patients walking out to the treatment area.  \n5:16 gunfire!\n5:18 officer injury\n5:19 new victim at treatment\n5:20 trauma alert with RMA to ORMC AND OPD is transporting one of their own to ORMC not waiting on transport\n5:27 another victim being rolled out\n5:30 OPD is transporting victims to ORMC. not waiting on treatment.  \n5:32. Two more trauma alerts. \nThey are establishing a second treatment group due to this confusion.  \n5:42 greens and yellows being transported\n\nShooter is dead according to police tweet- 6am\nDr Phillip ER has had some transported there as well.\n\nPress conference recap from BBC\n- \"Multiple people are dead inside Pulse Orlando nightclub\"\n- \"At least 42 people have been taken to hospitals\"\n- \"Our officer engaged in a gun battle with the suspect\"\n- \"This turned into a hostage situation\"\n- \"The decision was made to rescue hostages\"\n- \"We exchanged fire and the suspect is dead\"\n- \"We consider this an act of terrorism, whether it's domestic or international\"\n\nWhen i began listening to this scanner channel there were 4 listeners.

To this day, especially in times of 'disaster,' I remember my mother's words and I am always comforted by realizing that there are still so many helpers \u2013 so many caring people in this world.\"\n-Fred Rogers\n\n\nEveryone is so concerned about the ethnicity and affiliation of the shooter. It's a bit ridiculous. There have been a lot of police, fire department, paramedics, and other heroes that served us today. And I bet you that you could find one white man and one Muslim among them. One Trump supporter, one Hillary supporter, one Bernie supporter, and one political apathetic. One person pro-gun rights, one person pro-gun control. Straight, gay, transgendered, etc. So stop your petty bickering and \"hoping\" for a certain outcome here.\n\n\nIf your immediate response to any tragedy is hope in the name of some agenda, your priorities are so far out of line. That's walking a gray area between a real human being, and a monster capable of committing this atrocity in the first place.\n\nComment worth repeating here from /u/fifty-two https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/4npcdb/_/d45uqal",

On Reddit and mainstream media, it's all about the terrorism aspect and possible ties to Islamic radicals. Yet on Twitter and Facebook, the debate hasn't even touched on these aspects of the massacre and instead it's focusing LGBT rights, discrimination, and homophobia within the United States. They're blaming this attack solely on discrimination  and homophobia, and entirely ommiting any religious causes. While I think both aspects can be attributed to the motive of this shooter, it's interesting to watch the way different online communities focus on different parts of the story/spin the story to focus on their views.\n\n(Edited with some examples from Twitter)\n\n[Example 1](http://imgur.com/qacO8Dk)\n\n[Example 2](http://imgur.com/BSpokb1)\n\n[Example 3](http://imgur.com/FDMyBXA)\n\n(Another edit with a *very* misguided tweet)\n\n[Example 4](http://imgur.com/UxyMU00)",

Bash away because Islam needs to be a target of criticism until it stops leading to these crimes. It is sick that words are more harshly criticized than actions. Islam is not above criticism. More specifically, interpretations of Islam are not sacred. Why must we continue to tiptoe around Islamic beliefs and the violent rhetoric and actions that stem from those rotten roots? \n\nEven if Shia or Sufi Muslims and other Muslim minorities  aren't perpetrating these actions (and are often victims of them), it is good to scrutinize those beliefs, too. Especially when they lead to terrorism, human rights abuses, murder, violent rhetoric, etc. We need to keep talking about the elephant in the room or else we will never fix this sickness. For that reason and more, censoring is deplorable. \n\nIt's as if there is a cancer that we can't talk about because we're superstitiously afraid it will make the cancer worse. No! When there is a cancer, you talk about it, you scrutinize it, you dissect it, you emotionally vent about it. We need to say \"Fuck Islam\" even if not all Muslims are to blame. Us Muslims need to say fuck Islam if it leads people to this over such things as homosexuality or drawing cartoons. How the fuck can this continue to happen? How can we continue to walk on eggshells about it? Death for having fun?!

I extend my sympathies to the greater LGBTQ community for the effect this may have on them. May some form of peace and sense of justice be with you all and your communities. Absolutely heartbreaking.

My sister just wants everyone to know that ormc is a level one trauma center for a reason, and they were prepared for handling tragedy like this, and she is glad for it. Hearing from her about surgeries in hallways gave me chills. I'm glad I'm not the only one thinking of them. Also tijuana flats gave them all dinner so they've got that going for them, which is nice.",

I'll piggyback your statement and say Orlando fire deserves a lot of credit too. I stayed up listening to their scanner channel and they (as calm as they could) organized triage stations and mobile treatment sites. Command was trying to organize all their available emergency rigs and at some point they were throwing victims in police pick up trucks. It was pretty horrifying hearing drivers ask what hospital they could bring victims to as ORMC was overcapacity and only accepting red tag trauma alerts.",

At some point, police received word from inside the building that at least 15 people were hiding in a restroom.\n\n**Patio** Ray Rivera, 42, a D.J. at the club, was playing reggae music on the patio when the shooting started. \u201cI thought it was firecrackers,\u201d Mr. Rivera said. But the gunfire did not let up. \u201cI saw bodies on the floor, people on the floor everywhere,\u201d he said.\n\n3:02am - Pulse posts message to Facebook \"Everyone get out of pulse and keep running\"\n\n5:05am - Two controlled explosions by SWAT and other law enforcement are detonated. First explosion was a     confusion tactic; second explosion was a breach into a room(it took out a wall from the exterior of the building) where the gunman and hostages were. Eleven officers entered the club, and shots were exchanged.

    "body": "I think we, collectively, have to change our reactions when a gunman starts firing. Complicity is not safe, as demonstrated by these sorts of attacks. And fleeing results in more deaths than would otherwise occur if he was swarmed and disarmed. \n\nI recognize it goes against our instinctive reaction, but much better to have everyone rush him than run away in a panic. After 9/11, no would-be hijacker could reasonably expect a cooperative or submissive reaction on board an airliner. You'd be mad to try to hijack an aircraft now armed with only guns or blades. \n\nI realize there are differences, and terrorist tactics will evolve in tandem with a public's changing response, but killing 50 people with a gun in a close-quarters situation is not just the result of quick trigger finger, it's the result of a public that doesn't know how to respond in such situations. Though it goes against our better instincts, we are told to walk, not run, when a crowded building catches on fire, because stampedes can result in blocked doorways and higher casualties. We need to understand that when a gunman starts shooting in a crowded place, his worst-case scenario is for everyone in that club to start running towards him, not away. ",

Young men like having a purpose and cause. It's why see guys dressing up as Jedis or playing D&d. If they don't have an outlet in their jobs or life then many will latch on when someone or something gives them a purpose and sense of belonging. I don't know what the solution is.\n\n Beyond perhaps popularizing a philosophy of arete and agon where personal struggle and life can be its own purpose and provide self actualization and self worth that is robust and allow even disenfranchised men to develop and maintain their own worth and value independent of outside needs.\n\nSo many times we eschew struggle as weakness. And men who are struggling often are blind to the struggles of others. Everyone struggles and fights in their own way. But we see so many who give up because they feel it's pointless. Life is a struggle. It's suffering. It is what is. Perhaps we should embrace the work. If struggle was seen as value neutral and not a moral failing, then perhaps men who need help would be more willing to get it. You need to build a shed you get the tools needed to do it and you work. No one looks at you funny for buying a saw or hammer. If you need help with schizophrenia or counseling no one should look at you funny for getting help. Struggle is struggle and tools are tools. \n\nWe will all struggle til our last breathe. Building walls or rockets, disabilities or an overabundance, we all have our loads to bear, our pains and our sorrows. Our loads may be unequal too. Some with little carry more. Some with more carry little. There is no fault in a man dealing with his struggle. There is no fault in buying tools for a shed or eyeglasses for bad sight or medicine for a mind. Man makes tools. Tools were invented because man struggled. We should share our tools to help lessen the burden of our fellow man. And sometimes our struggles are ones we give ourselves and we can lessen our load if we simply unlock the chains we put around our own neck. We should not increase another's murder by lessening our own.\n\nBut struggle is not in itself bad. Through struggle we built cities and tools. language and art. We attain arete through agon(y). \n\nBrb. Inventing religion...",

The whole video is worth watching, the tower collapses right on /beside the guy filming (close enough) and at 1:30 you year the chirps, and at 2:30, you hear it EVERYWHERE, from all directions. It's like a nightmare / horror movie psychologically.
