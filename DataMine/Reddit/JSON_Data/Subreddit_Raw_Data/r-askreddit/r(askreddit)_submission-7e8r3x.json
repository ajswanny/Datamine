Heavy industries often have their own transformers, usually on the roof of their building. When these transformers get old, they need to be replaced, and the PCB need to be destroyed properly.

    "body": "TL;DR: Planned obsolescence and all the different types, with examples.\n\nPlanned obsolescence. Basically, products are designed by manufacturers to \"wear out\" after a certain period of time or amount of use. This is done to force consumers to re-purchase products or purchase new versions of products.\n\nThere are a few types of planned obsolescence. First is contrived durability, which means a product is designed to deteriorate quickly. A great example is how disposable razor blades wear out so quickly.\n\nThe second type is prevention of repairs, which means a product is designed in such a way that it is either made to be a single-use item (like disposable cameras), or in a way that uses proprietary hardware to prevent repairs and even damage the products if repairs are attempted. Apple is guilty of this with the majority of their product line-up, even seeking legislation to make it illegal to provide the difficult repairs.\n\nThe third is perceived obsolescence, which means a manufacturer frequently releases new \"versions\" of a product to make consumers feel as if the old product is far inferior. This is incredibly common, and in the grand scheme of things, fairly harmless. This type of planned obsolescence doesn't force a consumer to purchase a new product, but rather coerces them to, as do many other marketing campaigns. Common examples include new cars, phones, televisions, apparel, etc. for which new versions are released frequently.\n\nFourth is systemic obsolescence, which is when a manufacturer deliberately attempts to make a product obsolete by altering the system to make regular use difficult. Many people, including myself, accuse Apple of this when they release a new iPhone. Many people find that their old iPhone begins to run slowly after the latest iOS update following the release of the new iPhone model.\n\nLast is programmed obsolescence, which is when a product contains a mechanical or electrical system that limits the amount of uses the product has. One notable example is printer cartiriges which use software to limit the amount of pages they will print, regardless of the actual ink level. Hewlett Packard was sued on allegations that their ink cartridges would \"expire\" on a certain date.\n\nAltogether, these practices create an abundance of waste and unethically force consumers to buy more \"stuff\". This is a great way to make money hand-over-fist, and it is far more common than most people may think. People often complain that \"things just don't last as long as they used to,\" which, excluding survivorship bias, is true because they are built not to.",

Then the operating company leases the facility and equipment from the holding company and now the parent company can insure that in the event of a lawsuit or government enforcement action their assets are mostly protected.  \n\nThis is not 100% secure though because if you piss people off enough the government can absolutely come in and say \"this is bullshit, I don't care about your corporate structure you're essentially the same company so we'll pierce that corporate veil and take your assets anyway\" but generally the government doesn't like to do this because the people in office probably have a vested interest in the continued ability to shield assets in this way.",

They know they will win the contract and then the costs will rise through change orders and other unanticipated costs. Very common with public sector contracts. \n\n\n2) change orders. A lot of project managers (or in some cases, superintendents) will sign expensive change orders and split the money with the subcontractor (or in lieu of money have expensive remodels done on their own homes). \n\n\n3) over/under estimators. Estimators will purposely do both of the above in private sector jobs. For outright cash or other benefits. \n\n\n4) Business development. These folks will rep your company at trade shows, glad hand on your dime, go to expensive dinners win you contracts or, more likely will enjoy getting paid by you while they sell those contracts to your competitors. Or if they are very ambitious, leverage them into a higher paying job at a bigger company.\n\n\n5) also in this industry (more on the developer side), you can count on sleezy environmental lawyers to sue your project on behalf of NIMBY neighbors looking for a settlement to go away or hold you up (at your expense) for years while they go up the chain of appeals saying your enviromental documents are insufficient, forged, inadequate, incomplete or whatever. Neighborhoods don't see that money. The attorney will usually walk for 100k though (depending on the size of your project). \n\n\n6) government entities will all (ALL) extort projects in any way they can. I recall one that was on the edge of a city limits, near a freeway, near a creek and had a green patch (seasonal wetland), near a walking trail. City wanted a new road, county wanted new bridges, dept of fish and game wanted a wider creek (for miles), parks and recs wanted a trail extension, state transportation dept wanted offramp/onramp improvements, army corp of engineers (for the wetland) wanted to remove the wetland and buy and donate riverfront property to them (personally) to replace it. \n\n\nSource: 8 years in the industry \n",

When suppliers would call and politely ask (and eventually not so politely ask) for late payments to be rectified, the plant manager would get on the phone and tell them to f*&k themselves, then find a new supplier.  Sometimes the owner / president would do the same, basically because he enjoyed ruining people.  They eventually ran out of providers for tools, materials, etc though.  When you're turning out shite aerospace components because your machinists are working with broken bits and tools they've salvaged from bins, then your customer stop paying you.  These guys went from being a billion dollar company to being a million dollar company to not being a company at all.  They took a lot of small companies down on the way though, including the one I worked for at the time.  If the scum that ran that place die penniless and alone in a cold alleyway, then it's still too good for them.",

    "body": "Oh god, I used to work in retail and this was something my boss and managers always insisted that we do. I was a cashier and I was explicitly instructed to have a sticker or a keychain or some other low cost item on hand so I could 'add on' that item to the customer's items without the customer noticing. The intent was to artificially increase the average IPS (items per sale) which boosted our store's sales stats relative to the other branches in the area. A lot of customers didn't notice, and if they did, we were instructed to be all \"Oops, sorry, I thought that item was yours, let me remove it from your bill.\" I hated it.\n\nThat was just the tip of the iceberg with them. They also made us sign up customers for a bullshit rewards program without their knowledge or consent by getting their phone numbers or email addresses. If anyone ordered online from our store, we automatically grabbed their information and added them to our rewards program database to (again) artificially increase our stats. It was slimy as hell and after a while I refused to do it. Best job I ever quit.\n\nEDIT: This is getting some traction so I'll answer some commenters. Many of you want me to name this company outright, but I can do you one better. I have a hunch that my old company wasn't the only company that did this, so I urge you all to have the same caution no matter what store you go into. Black Friday and the holiday rush is the perfect time for this fraud to happen. Here is some advice that applies to any large retailer you visit over the holidays:\n\n- Always check your receipt. Make sure there aren't any extra or missing items on it, no matter how many things you bought. Plus, sometimes honest mistakes do happen at the cash register. Better yet, take pictures of your receipt with your phone.\n\n- Be cautious about giving employees your information. Sometimes it's used for marketing and advertising purposes, sometimes it's used for rewards programs, and sometimes it's used for a store credit card application. You can always ask why if an employee wants your phone number/email address, and you can always decline.",

I\u2019m in Canada too so asking for diagnoses ain\u2019t exactly quick. Seemed a little sadistic begging more some answer about something I don\u2019t know when I\u2019m under extreme stress from both pain and lack of sleep and I was already doing exactly what he wanted and he knew where I was getting him an answer. My family doctor told me \u201chow many days do you want off? I\u2019ll write anything on here\u201d so I got 5 days off. And reassessment if not passed by then. But dear god lord do I want it out of me ASAP\n\nSorry for the rant but I was quite upset at my boss on the phone and he heard the tone and attacked me harder. Found out I need to get a new job today.\n\nEdit: for real though if I get fired should I be contacting a lawyer? I haven\u2019t even been with this company a whole year but it\u2019s been a steady decline (according to other coworkers) since I\u2019ve started due to major restructuring and problems with a couple employees. With now one out on sick leave (me) another (manager) on stress leave, and another just got fired for missing too much work. I\u2019ve been here since April. I don\u2019t plan on calling in sick but I\u2019m not going to just never get sick. So if it comes to that would it be worth the hassle? I started in April and intended to stay in the industry, decent pay, I\u2019m good at it. ",

I've been given the run around for months about turning into a \"full hire\", and then was told there wasn't room in the budget to bring me on as a part of the team.\n\nThe worst part was when my boss asked me: \"well, if you already feel like you're treated as part of the team, why does it matter that you're a temp?\" Precisely because I can be severed \"at will\" without any kind of protection!\n\nAs if shitty benefits, a laughable salary, and no formal ties to a company for whom I work my butt off wasn't obvious enough...\n\nUgh.\n\nEdit: learning about at-will labor relations across the US from other commenters...Crazy. I feel like there are additional vulnerabilities, in some cases, with temp contracts - gap in benefits from start date to coverage, repeated changing of assignment with no coverage, overages in hours without contractual guidelines. No company protections, no organizational perks (commuter programs, etc.), or travel-reimbursements...

    "body": "> Refuse to give references when they quit \"to protect yourself legally\". \n\nTHIS right here is where I'm in trouble. I spent almost 3 years at a company working up the experience necessary for me to do travel work in the industry. They're 100% refusing to provide me references and they are doing everything they can to intimidate coworkers of mine from providing them for me, even if said coworkers are providing them through their own cell phone and email addresses. The problem is, the intimidation is working. The other problem, which I wish I could have seen coming, is my former employer only has 1 or 2 supervisor roles and they definitely outright refuse references. The issue with the travel work being that they require supervisor references even if I have several outstanding coworker ones already lined up. It's absolutely absurd. I've shed some hot tears over this a few times over the last 3 weeks.\n\nEDIT: Since I see people asking what field others are in in this thread, I'm medical.",

    "body": "Holy hell, I did this while going to college and it was the worst. I was getting paid 1/3 of what everyone else was getting for the same work and I had to show up to the temp agency everyday at 5 am to get 'assigned' to the same job site for work starting at 7 am (like, once I got the post a few times I was pretty sure I'd have that same work for at least a few weeks but they made me essentially apply for the job assignment everyday, with the prospect of being hired for real at some point by the factory).\n\nThe absolute worst part for me was that the 'temp to hire' fakery was well known among the other workers so no one bothered to get to know me. I ate a packed lunch there every day by myself for 2 and a half months. I had these stupid steel-toed rubber boots that I 'rented' from the temp agency (they took it out of my daily pay) because I couldn't drop the money on my own pair (and why would I, when the work was day-to-day), so all the workers just called me 'Ducky' the whole time I was there. By the end, I was mad at the company and temp agency for sure, but I was also pissed at the other workers who knew what was up, but they were getting theirs so they couldn't be arsed to extend some empathy.\n\nEdit: My top comment is about how I was an exploited little temp Ducky in my early 20's. Solidarity reddit friends!\n\nThank you all for your kind and thoughtful comments! A few clarifications:\n\n-My context is Canadian and this took place in the province of Ontario, which has shit legislation on who pays for PPE. The Occupational Health and Safety legislation that covers the Ontario jurisdiction doesn't specify who pays for PPE. If the employer has to provide the PPE, it generally must also pay for it. But if an employer is only required to ensure that workers use PPE, it doesn\u2019t have to pay for that PPE (and if you're unionized, it's often spelled out in your CA). That's my understanding anyway, after a quick glance at the Ministry of Labour site. I commend those that are pointing out that forcing workers to pay for PPE is an actionable offense in other jurisdictions though! While acknowledging that some are better positioned to act than others, I'm a strong advocate of people knowing and exercising their labour rights!\n\n-For those commenting that my agency sounded especially scummy/why didn't I complain and go elsewhere: This was with LabourReady, and they were indeed scummy (/u/isthatrhetorical mentions below that they go by PeopleReady now and are still scum). They were also the only agency in a small college town with a very high unemployment rate, which sort of exacerbated the whole expendable feeling.\n\n-For those discussing the plight of the FT workers, for whom the presence of temps is a reminder that they're own job is not necessarily a guarantee: I absolutely agree! It was a hard lesson when I was young and as I mentioned, the worst part of a generally terrible experience. On the plus side, the lesson has been fruitful: I've evolved into a fairly active union steward and picket captain in recent years and have gleaned a lot of knowledge about how employers leverage precarity to divide workers! Being aware of the constraints that limit worker action and responsive capacity-building is super important!\n\n-For those hoping I'm on to better things: Thanks! I teach law and policy at a university these days (where I frequently use labour law to instruct and empower my undergrads). Sessional/Adjunct course instructor work is precarious and temp-like in a lot of ways, unfortunately, but I at least get to do it in whatever goddamn boots I want.",

For example, if my shift ended at 1pm and we were super busy until 130pm, I wasnt allowed to leave until the rush died down, but she would cut off that extra 30 minutes. I always knew it happened but once I had to fax something to the office and accidentally printed off the wrong page, and it was the sheet that showed the manual changes to the time clock, knowing it happens is one thing but actually seeing the exact numbers pissed me off so much. The reason she did it was because the owner gave a bonus at the end of the year to whichever of his managers of all his stores had the best labour %. Fuck that job.\n\nThe worst was closing. We were always understaffed for closes, scheduled until 130am, but sometimes would have to stay as late as 3 or 4am to get everything done.

At first we thought it was just some kind of reaction to the disinfectant. Sometimes people get dry skin, pustules, things like that. But it didn't take long until more people started to show symptoms and a few weeks later some of my colleagues had it too. Every time we told our direct superior that it looks like scabies she told us we are just being paranoid, that it's just dry skin, a lot of people get dry skin, we need to use more moisturizing cream, it's basically our own fault for not taking care of our skin.\nEverybody stayed quiet after that but it only got worse. Some time later i got it too. Man i tell you that stuff is nasty. It started with my hands, then i got it on my neck, on my thighs, genital area, the stuff was everywhere and it just wouldn't go away, it only got worse. \n\n\nSo i went to the doctor, told her what was happening, she looked at me and was kind of hesitant to diagnose scabies. I think because she knew i was working in a nursing home, and as you surely know when there is a scabies outbreak in a nursing home it's a public health issue, it needs to be reported to the public health department and that's bad news for the nursing home.\nAs i was saying, she didn't diagnose scabies, but she still gave me an ointment called \"InfectoScab\", and who would've thought, after i took it the symptoms subsided. It took quiet some time for the stuff to go away, i'd say at least a month. At least! \nBut it wouldn't disappear completely. There were still some spots left and i had the feeling they were growing again and i was right.\nThe stuff started to spread out again. \n\n\nAt this time nobody at work had gone to the doctor so i guessed i got infected at work again because the whole place was still contaminated. So i went to my boss again and told her i wouldn't come in tomorrow unless we are being taken seriously. After that i had to go the big boss and tell her the exact same thing and our nursing management finally scheduled an appointment with the dermatologist. A week later he came to us at work. Looked at us. Didn't diagnose scabies. \nSchooled us about skin care as if we're too stupid to know the difference between dry skin and scabies.\nBut just like the doctor i had gone to, he too prescribed us InfectoScab \"just to calm us down\" as he put it. We had to time it so that every employee and patient took it at the same time so we could make sure that none of the critters would survive, so we all came to work on saturday, put the lotion on ~40 patient from head to toe and after that on ourselves. And it was a miracle, even though it wasn't really scabies the drug that's specifically designed to get rid of scabies worked.\nIt took some time again for the symptoms to disappear completely but we were scabies free, finally.\n\nBut i was mad as hell that it took managment so fucking long to do something about it.\nI should've gone to the public health department myself.

All businesses are required by law to permit their PCBs and other hazardous materials (such as carcinogenic solvents), as well as keep their haz waste manifests and service records on file.  They must be able to produce both if directed by their LOP or the EPA.  Failure to do so makes them a responsible party by default and they become liable for subsequent clean up and remediation, usually under both federal and state laws.  \n\nThe exact law that applies varies from state to state.  I work primarily with UST cases, and I can tell you that in California the code that makes cleanup enforceable for underground storage violations is [Section 25299 of the Health and Safety Code](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=HSC&sectionNum=25299).  Under those codes, a fine of $5,000/day per tank can be assessed for each day of delinquency, and a fine of $10,000 per day, per tank, can be assessed failure to comply with an issued notice of violation or cleanup directive.

However, vendors can submit questions to the contracting team which is then required to forward the questions to us, for answer in writing back to the contracting team who then provides the verbatim response to the vendor. The process itself isn't \"wrong\" it exists specifically to avoid vendors having an \"inside track\" and helps keep the process more fair by forcing everyone to go through the same process. But if the contract team is not on the ball (which happens a lot) or the program office has someone less than competent assigned to run the project and respond to questions (which also happens a lot) then things like this happen.\n\nI watched one project go through a lot of issues because the guy put in charge of writing the RFP that became the contract statement of work was NOT the expert on either the technology or the problem domain or the customer organization -- *I was* -- but he was the boss' pet so he got the lead role. This was despite the fact that I have a decade of experience *with that software in that domain in that org* and have handled contracts for exactly this same type of product before. And I had been pushing for *years* for exactly the type of transformation that we were about to undergo (\"his idea\" of course) with this product and knew the requirements blindfolded.\n\nBut because of the dynamic that was set up I had to take a back seat, so all I could do was wash my hands and watch it unfold. I would up being called by the customer organization for secret meetings behind his back to help them craft responses back to him to \"fix\" his RFP drafts so the actual requirements would go out properly. But even then things got fucked up and we ended up buying software that now a year later still hasn't been used. Immediately after buying it he decided to take it through software testing and approval personally, meaning he was installing and testing the software, except he didn't know exactly what to do so he would run to me for advice and eventually tasking me on the project. I kept telling him to calm down and tried to guide him as best I could, but he would flip/flop and try to do everything at once, or if he ran into a problem he would try to change everything and start over instead of starting small and making incremental baby steps to move forward in testing. Besides I kept telling him his job should be to *coordinate having the vendor perform the test* but he insisted on being \"hands-on\" which meant his actual job as project manager wasn't being done. And because he was \"hands-on\" he would overrule my advice and direct me to do what he chose despite my advice against it, but ok whatever dude I get the same paycheck at the end of the day. I did what I could to try to keep it alive because it would ultimately benefit tens of thousands of people, but it was like trying to steer the Titanic with an oar.\n\nWhat a waste of time, money, and effort.",

This past year they had a speaker that all he talked about was how to work with a millennial workforce. He even straight up said, \"You can't treat them the way you treat the past generations, they won't put up with the abuse.\".\n\nIt's why being a \"millennial\" is being stereotyped as being lazy, unreliable, and stubborn. Businesses want other millennials and younger generations to look at it in a negative light so they'll be more like the older generations and just suck it up and get fucked in the ass. \"Sure I work 60 hours a week with no benefits for shit pay, but at least I'm not a lazy millennial\".
