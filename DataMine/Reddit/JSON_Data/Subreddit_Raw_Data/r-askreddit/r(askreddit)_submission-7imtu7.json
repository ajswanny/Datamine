The only thing that de-suspended my disbelief was the fact that Peter Cushing (Grand Moff Tarkin) died in 1994 and Carrie Fisher (Leia) was too old to play a young Leia in 2016. Other than that I probably would've chalked it up to bad lighting/makeup.\n\nEDIT: But that's the problem the Uncanny Valley presents to CGI. You either have to do it *absolutely perfectly* or make it rather cartoonish. ~~There's no in between~~ Do or do not, there is no try. I think Rogue One might be one of the first films to get into the former category, or at least close to it, and to me that's something amazing.\n\nEDIT^2 : Carrie Fisher (Rest In Peace) was alive during the shooting of Rogue One, amended statement.",

When he realized that water was making the crops grow, he personally stopped Beef Supreme at Monday Night Rehabilitation and gave Joe's ass a pardon.  Do you think our current President would be adult enough to admit being wrong and then quickly correct himself?  Hell no.

I fear an \"Examination Day,\" future.\n\nExamination Day  is an episode from The Twilight Zone (1985 version)\n\n>Dickie Jordan is an intelligent and curious youth in a dystopian future. It is Dickie's twelfth birthday, which means he is required by law to report to a government testing facility for a mandatory IQ test. As Dickie gleefully tells his parents how he was told by an older friend that the test is easy and that he's sure he will pass it, his parents react stressfully and avoid his questions. They bring him to the facility and go back home to wait anxiously for the test results.\n\n>When Dickie arrives at the testing facility, he is given a medicine. The examiner says that the medicine will ensure he tells the truth. He is then given a series of intelligence tests and appears to be doing very well, much to his joy.\n\n>After his parents await the test results at home for hours, they are contacted by the government. Dickie's test results are in: his intelligence quotient exceeded the legal limit that the totalitarian government allows and he was therefore executed. The parents burst into tears as the government examiners ask the Jordan's how they would like their son's remains to be handled.\n\nThe distrust of educated elites in this country just might start going that far.",
