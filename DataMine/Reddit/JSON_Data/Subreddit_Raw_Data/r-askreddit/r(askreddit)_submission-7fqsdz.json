    "body": "I'll use my college and not my high school because nothing really noteworthy happened in high school.\n\nAt Northeastern University, [ten tons of concrete fell four stories from the facade of a school-owned dorm onto the sidewalk of the busy street that the university is centered on (Huntington Avenue)](http://www.bostonherald.com/news_opinion/local_coverage/2009/07/disaster_averted_northeastern_building_collapse). This street is as heavily traveled by pedestrians as any on campus, and is pretty typical of a Boston sidewalk on a typical day (i.e. not Lansdowne Street before a Red Sox game but not some neighborhood sidewalk on a residential street either). It was 8:15am when it happened. \n\nSomehow, no one was on that sidewalk, and no one was hurt. It was a Tuesday IIRC, and orientation was happening, which consists of lots of group tours/walks around campus. Simply amazing. Would have been catastrophic for the school if even one person was injured. ",

I attended just a pretty small town school in rural Yorkshire, UK.\n\nEdit 1: This incident was primary school. I was in year 5 so it would've been in like 2001 or 2002 I was nine at the time. The dog breed as far as I can remember was some kind a miniature Shetland sheep dog. It looked basically like a miniature lassie dog. \n\nEdit 2: Also forgot At secondary school our head teacher ran over her laptop in her car. This happened when I was in year 8, so would've been about 2006. Apparently it was an accident, but we never did get the full story on that one.",

    "body": "Two interconnected incidents.  I'm old... so I was in high school at the time that Hong Kong transferred back to China.  If you had come to my high school 3 or 4 years before the transfer, you would have seen a maybe 5% Chinese student population.  But it jumped suddenly, like, up to about 50% in my junior year and stayed that way.  We had all these Chinese students, all from Hong Kong suddenly transfer to my high school, in a suburb of Toronto (nowhere near to Chinatown, by the way).  I'd say about half of those kids were there without their parents, living with other families... their parents were expected to come later, probably after the transfer back to China had been completed.  \n\nFor some reason, that I never fully understood, it was a known thing that these kids usually had cash on them.  Like, a _lot_ of cash.  I never really checked personally, but we used to talk about how they would have at least $1000 in their wallets every day.  \n\nAnyway, the first incident was that a kid from another school came into our school one day and found the first Chinese student he saw and beat him with a pipe and stole his wallet.  The reason I think of this as \"the incident\" is that it was the reason our school suddenly started locking the doors, and you had to get in before a certain time otherwise you couldn't get into the school without buzzing in and the office knowing you were late, and we had security guards walking around all of a sudden.  Totally changed the atmosphere of the school.\n\nThe second incident happened the year after I graduated from high school.  I was back home for vacation and all our little suburbia was talking about was the principal of my high school being investigated for exploitation.  Apparently, she had been taking regular trips to Hong Kong, and somehow convincing parents there to pay her insane amounts of money and she would make sure their kids got in to her school -- which is such bullshit... i mean, I am assuming it works this way everywhere in Canada, but you just have to live in the neighborhood of a school and be of school age to get into a school, no one should be paying to go to a public school (beyond any regular taxes, anyway).  I'm honestly not entirely sure of what kind of lies she told these poor people, and I'm not sure if it had anything to do with why their kids were there without their parents and why they had so much cash on them all the time, but regardless -- she exploited a whole bunch of people.  And, in doing so changed the makeup of not only our school, but our entire suburb.  ",

    "body": "When I was a sophomore at all girls boarding school, someone had stolen my package from the school post office in a string of package thefts over the course of a week or so. My package was knitting supplies for a class that I needed to finish my final project. \n\nOne day, I saw this notoriously weird girl knitting in the hallway. At first I actually thought it was cool she picked up knitting. But I realized they were the same needles and yarn I had ordered.\n\nI went to her room and knocked on the door. The doors had fogged windows and old school latches without locks and it was typical to tap the latch and lean your head in to each others rooms. As I looked in, I saw another project with the other yarn I ordered! \n\nI came back later and she was there. I simply said, \"Hey, look, I know you took my package. I really need it for class so if you give it back, I won't tell anyone you took it.\" She burst into tears and asked how dare I accuse her and that some friend sent her those knitting supplies. So I said I'd have to report her and left. \n\nDuring study hall that night, one of the dorm parents came to my room. She told me I was in trouble for accusing the girl of stealing and that I should be ashamed and apologize. I told her I was sure she had been responsible for stealing all the packages. I put together all my order info with photos and told them I saw her with all of it. \n\nThe next day, we were called to an all school emergency assembly. The school dean announced that right then, while everyone was accounted for, they were doing \"random\" room searches. They searched her room first, and found EVERYTHING. I mean every single thing that people were missing for the two years she was there. She was hauled off to a locked room in the health center and sent away. The faculty had to pack her things and try to recover stolen items, by most of it got thrown out. She had a collection of dildos (stolen, idk). One of the most remarkable finds was the credit card of another girls dad that she lifted from his wallet over parents weekend. She even stole my Rueben sandwich from the hall fridge one time (still pisses me off).\n\nShe had a lot of compulsive disorders, apparently. Her roommate mysteriously left the school over thanksgiving break and no one ever heard from her again. I'm pretty sure we know why now. \n\nTLDR: all girls boarding school klepto stole my knitting supplies package from the PO, I got in trouble for accusing her, next day they did \"random\" searches and found every reported missing item from the last 2 years. They found a dad's credit card among dildos and Rueben sandwiches. ",

I frantically searched for friends of mine to find out what happened to Julio, and finally met up with someone who had the story. \n\nJulio and a few new high school friends had met up after school to hang out.  They were playing around at an old junk yard, where there was a rope swing.  Julio had pretended to put the rope around his neck, joking around like a 12 year old boy. He slipped and accidentally hung himself.  One of his friends had tried to cut the rope with their teeth.  Those seventh graders who had just become friends watched him die.  The whole school was in shock, given the details and how tragic the whole thing was.  I didn\u2019t go to class that day, just sat in the library with my friends and other classmates who couldn\u2019t fathom what had happened.  I can still picture what Julio looked like, and I only knew him for a week.  He was a good kid. ",

All the kids ran riot, they stayed in a hotel that had one of the floors sealed off, which turned out to be a knocking shop. One of the students fell in love with a hooker, went mad and had to be drugged by a doctor to get him to the airport when they were leaving. Our school never did international trips again.\n\nEdit: I just woke up to see this comment took off. Thanks for gold stranger. Little more Detail we were from Ireland, our Maths teacher was a black belt in taekwondo, taxi driver tried to scam him and then pulled a knife on him, two senior students joined in. Ages of students from 14 to 18. It was a complete shit show of a trip. \n\nA few people don\u2019t believe this story, which is unfortunate. But it did happen I\u2019m afraid.

There had been 2 other recent suicides in the class just below us that year, and she apparently had a rough life so it was labeled suicide. \n\nA year or two later I found out the boyfriend\u2019s guilt got the better of him and he confessed to killing her because she told him she was pregnant while they were doing Special K and in his altered state it was all he could think to do. \n",

    "body": "Smearing poop can be an indication that a child is being abused. There's a lot of reasons actually.\n\nEDIT: People are asking for more information on this, so I'll throw a few links up.\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16511365\n\nhttp://www.dummies.com/relationships/sex/warning-signs-of-sexual-abuse-in-children/\n\nhttp://www.minddisorders.com/Del-Fi/Encopresis.html\n\n EDIT 2: Some people are getting upset so, In regards to the first link; I'm aware that it makes it sound like there's no correlation initially, but it goes on to suggest that stress and other factors are a potential. If being abused *doesn't* cause stress, I don't know what does. I'm a redditor, not a doctor people. I have lots and lots of experience in the mental health industry and would love to raise awareness of problems, but I can't exactly write you an essay of my own. Also, literally the second sentence I wrote was, \"There's a lot of reasons actually.\" \n\nNow, from the first link:\n \n> Reported soiling rates were 10.3% (abuse), 10.5% (psychiatric), and 2% (normative), respectively. The soiling rate in the abused group differed significantly from that of the normative group, but not from the psychiatric group.\n\nThat seems to suggest that abused children have an 8.3% increase in this behavior over a normal child's rate. So yes, it could just be stress. Or it could be an age factor. Hell, it could just be boredom. However this is not a very normal behavior and at 7th grade and should be considered as a potential for other factors first IMO. Finding the kid, getting really pissed off at them when they potentially have some serious problems is only going to make things worse. ",

This kid just idolised his uncle, so him and a mate took another mate out in to the same forest the uncle used for bodies and killed him with a sledge hammer. No motive - these two kids just wanted to know what it was like to murder someone and I guess, were better friends with each other than they were with the third friend.",

There's a lot of reasons a kid might feel the need to smear poop, it can be an act of frustration, as in a 'fuck you' to whatever establishment they are performing the act in, or it could just be some sort of gross fascination with feces. But to me I think it comes down to attention seeking. People tend to view child abuse as strictly within the confines of physical harm or sexual assault, but in actuality neglect can fuck kids up just as much. Like being locked in rooms for days at a time with no access to the outside world, and yes, a restroom. It's actually not surprising that a kid might resort to playing with his own excrement out of pure boredom, and boom, a recurring behavior is born. Also the sight and smell of poop on the walls is enough to grab the attention of even the shittiest neglectful parents, so that in itself, in the child's eyes, validates the behavior. Truth is, there's a lot reasons people might smear poop, some really are just doing it to be funny or going for shock factor, but sadly it's also very likely that it is a behavior picked up in childhood due to neglect and abuse.",

He admitted stabbing Sorenson 13 times after an extortion plan went awry and Sorenson threatened his life.\n\n\"There was not a murder,\" Orlewicz testified.\n\nOn November 7, Orlewicz said, he, Alexander Letkemann and Sorenson arrived at his grandfather's house in Canton, Michigan, with the intent of robbing Adam Duwe, who had just inherited $40,000. But Orlewicz said he felt \"icky\" about the plan and was going to pretend Duwe couldn't make it. That's when Sorenson's temper flared, Orlewicz testified.\n\nOrlewicz said Sorenson took out a gun and threatened to kill him.\n\n\"You think this is a game?\" Orlewicz recalled Sorenson screaming. \"I'm going to drop you to your knees and blow your frigging brains out.\"\n\nOrlewicz said Sorenson began waiving the gun around, so he grabbed a knife from a tool bench and stabbed him from behind.\n\nAs the two fought, Orlewicz said, the gun dropped from Sorenson's hand. Sorenson scrambled to find the gun, Orlewicz said, and the two continued to struggle. \"I kept trying to stab him and get leverage in the fight,\" Orlewicz said. \"I was stabbing him in the back.\"\n\nDuring his testimony Orlewicz also admitted that after Sorenson died, he used a hacksaw to decapitate him. Orlewicz said he threw Sorenson's torso into a field and set it on fire. The defendant said he took a blowtorch to Sorenson's hands to cover up fingerprints.\n\nOrlewicz told the jury he feared that Sorenson was tied to the Mafia and that his family would come after him.\n\nHe said his actions after the death were all out of panic.\n\nOrlewicz corroborated Letkemann's testimony that Letkemann stood by and did nothing as Orlewicz stabbed Sorenson.\n\nLetkemann, 18, pleaded guilty to second-degree murder April 1. He will face 20 to 30 years in prison in exchange for his testimony against Orlewicz.\n\nOrlewicz denied Letkemann's assertions that after the killing, he played with Sorenson's head like a puppet.\n\n\"That's someone else's imagination,\" he said.\"\n\nhttp://murderpedia.org/male.O/o/orlewicz-jean-pierre.htm",

The baby never stirred. The moms never stopped getting their periods ... And on and on. It's AMAZING. The one I saw showed a mom who was home alone with her ten year old son when she went into labor. She literally thought she was dying. She even hid herself away in her bedroom so her son wouldn't have to watch her die. Only when she reached down and felt a hairy head coming out of her did she finally figure it out. And then she had to call her son into the bedroom to help her deliver the baby. \n\nAt the end of that episode, they showed the son holding his little sister, while the mom talked about how guilty she felt for having to force her son to deal with all that. (But he seemed totally fine.)\n\nAbout the only reality show I have any use for, every episode is a gem. ",

As a bonus they rarely drain the pipes out so it's usually stagnant water that has been sitting in the pipes for years, not the clean clear water that you see in movies\n\n\nEdit: This reminds me of a funny story, awhile ago in high school my friends and I had this great idea to drop bouncy balls off the second floor of our school onto the first floor. We started with a couple at a time but as the weeks went by we added to our collection, usually getting 25 cent ones from the machines in a restaurant we passed on our way to school. Eventually toward the end of the year we dropped a bucket of them over the side and one of them bounced up and hit a sprinkler head and broke it resulting in it pouring water all over the place. The janitor caught us in the act so we ended getting our parents called and had to help clean up. When I got home my dad was outside fixing up our neighbor's car and he told me that \"accidents happen but sometimes even if they are accidents you still get punished because that was irresponsible behavior\". He told me to get him his pair of jumper cables out of the garage, then he told me I was grounded for a week from video games and I had to do the dishes and used the jumper cables to jumpstart our neighbor's car.

It was the closest I had ever been to death, and I was still pretty far removed from it. I never talked to anyone about it but I really struggled for months. It messed me up pretty bad. I had nightmares about his death and really just had a hard time processing it.\n\nI think at that age things like that cause most people to be confronted with their own mortality for the first time. They're all just trying to process it. My school brought in counselors, but it wasn't like someone like me could use up that resource when he had plenty of friends who did need to see someone.",

Basically the weaker kids were rolled up in the mats or just pushed in a corner and then covered with the mats.  Since the kid couldn't seen what was happening, everyone in the gym got free hits without the victim being able to see who was doin it.  \n\nIt started off as pretty harmless with people just slapping the mats.  It didn't exactly start off as bullying either since everyone could be ambushed and rolled up.  Everyone got their turn in the mats and it was all in good fun.\n\nBut predictably it became more violent and people started fighting back leaving only the small kids as victims.  Instead of slaps on the mat people started just punching and kicking the mats.  People ended up grouping up both to protect themselves and attack others in numbers.  It all ended for us when a kid broke free just as another kid went for a flying kick, and ended up hitting the escaping kid in the face.  The coach wasn't even that mad and had the attitude that was closer to \"well you idiots ruined it now, this is why we can't have nice things.\"  \n\nI could easily see one of these situations ending in death.  Being in the mats was terrifying and chaotic even as you're laughing your ass off.  If a kid has a asthma attack or a panic attack, there's no way for anyone to know while you're wrapped up because everyone is screaming.  ",
