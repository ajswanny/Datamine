    "body": "Ok, let's do this.\n\nFirst things first - That million dollars is practically worthless compared to immortality. Ever dime of that cash can and should be spent ensuring that the snail never, ever reaches me.\n\nFirst things first, I keep an eye on him. It's tempting to want to hop on a plane or a train and get as far away as possible. But once I do that, he's gone and I'll never see him again until 3am on July 14th, 2072, when the sneaky little cuss slips in the door and slimes onto me before I ever wake up and notice him No, I'm going to be within visual distance of the snail, slowly moving away from it, until Snail Containment Plan Part A is done.\n\nNext I grab my phone. I call up someone I can trust with my life, and tell them to come to my location within the hour, and to bring a metal cash box, a good padlock, and a firearm. Once they arrive, I inform them of the deal and ask them to grab the snail, shove it into the metal box, and lock it up.\n\nOnce the snail is temporarily secured, I ask my friend to carry around the box, never letting it out of their sight, and to prevent its opening with as much force as is required. We arrive at some reasonable figure for this service - Maybe $50,000.\n\nNow we can start in on the real work. I'm on the phone again, contracting with a tungsten machining service out of Willowbrook, IL. I ask them to construct for me a hollow tungsten sphere with a small, sealable opening, ideally via both exterior bolts and sintering. I ask them for a rush job and a thick wall depth, perhaps as much as a foot thick. The spherical shape should keep material costs as low as possible for a given thickness, but between the unusual object, large amount of tungsten, and speedy delivery, I invest a truly insane amount into this project - Let's say $100,000. I ask them to deliver it to my current location as fast as possible.\n\nOnce the tungsten ball arrives, I have my friend stand well away from me and transfer the snail into the center of the sphere. I ask them to pour a little salt down into the hole after it, just to give the snail a little reminder of who he's dealing with. Once snail and salt are both inside, we seal the hollow sphere with the bolts.\n\nTungsten is an amazing material. Incredibly tough, dense, and heat-resistant. You could drop it into molten lava and it wouldn't matter. Which, coincidentally, is almost what I'd like to do next.\n\nNow we make sure that damn thing stays shut. I find the nearest metal refinery and call them up. I also contract with a heavy machinery moving company to move the tungsten sphere to the refinery. Once the refinery has sintered the tungsten sphere shut, I buy an entire industrial crucible (those big buckets) of molten iron. And the crucible the iron came in. I have them drop the tungsten sphere into the molten iron, and let the whole mass cool in place. Mr. Snaily snail ain't going anywhere, but I'm probably down another $100,000.\n\nNow I'm on the phone to specialist movers. Chartering a boat. We're taking this thing halfway around the word. We take the boat right over the marianas trench - Not the deepest point, but deep enough - We push the whole assembly over the side. Literal tons of once-molten iron, refinery crucible, tungsten, salt, and snail slip over the side and begin dropping into the briny deep. Another $100,000 gone, but well worth the cost.\n\nGood. That's bought me a little breathing room. But we're not anywhere close to done yet. I still have at least $500,000 left. I'm going to invest it into solid business ventures and slow growing but secure assets. We're building a fortune - And who cares if it takes a few centuries? I'm frickin' immortal baby!\n\nBut as I develop my fortune, it's getting invested into space. SpaceX, asteroid mining projects, whatever. I am trapped on the one planet in the entire universe where I can actually die, and I have no intention of staying there.\n\nOver the millennia, I slowly apply my fortune and influence to push mankind to the stars. And the moment living on another planet becomes viable, I'm there. And the instant a habitable planet is around another star? I'm on the first generation ship heading that direction.\n\nBut I can't think in such a short sighted manner now. I'm immortal, and I need to think like it. Eventually, the sun is going to burn the earth to a crisp, and then that damn snail is going to be free. It might take him a few million years to land on something, but he'll do it eventually. And then he will construct a spacecraft and begin crawling towards me again.\n\nWhat I care about now is lightcones and black holes. Earth's gotta go. Sorry whatever's left of humanity. We evacuate anyone still on the old planet, and use a gravity tractor to push Earth into a black hole. A nice, big one so that hawking radiation will take an incredibly long time to evaporate it away into nothing.\n\nAnd then I board  a ship. A fast ship. I accelerate to as close to lightspeed as I can get, piloting directly away from the black hole with the snail inside. I want to be so far away and moving so quickly that the heat death of the universe would occur far, far before the snail ever reaches me, even on the fastest ship his freakishly clever little brain can construct.\n\nSo that's the way the universe ends. With nothing it in except for infrared heat, one hyperintelligent snail suspended in an inky void, and one human screaming away from it at .99C.\n\nCheers.",

Of course what I do is I embrace this snail coming towards me, but secretly I have a plan. Most people would settle for a metal box to trap the snail but they are forgetting one thing that this snail-being super intelligent and all- can probably operate a motor vehicle, go around a box, not fall for a hamster wheel, etc. Exactly what I do is instead of looking for these cheap tricks in hopes of living an eternal life of riches is invest. But what I invest in you might ask? Obviously not some sort of simple container for the snail. Desire of riches is not going to fool me into that sort of trap. Yes, that's right, I invest in a sort of microscopic coating. Once I find the right team of scientists, I invest half of my million into developing this coating. Not only would this coating have to cover me, but it would also have to be permanent and invisible. Could this be possible? Even I do not know, but with right team, it might just. Though that's not the end.  Over the years, this snail would probably realize that I had a microscopic coating so it would evolve to deal with this. Little does the snail know, through the hundreds of years I had devised a second plan. Deception. Making a clone of myself, the clone would be eternal too, and having both of me's go to opposite ends of the earth, the snail would be trapped, feeling an equally strong pull in both directions the snail would be paralyzed, and I would be living a life of eternal joy. Except for one thing....read the first letter of every sentence to find out.",

Spend its money.\n3. Actually do much of anything to hurt you besides touch you.\n4. Only knows what direction you are in, and basically nothing else about you.\n5. Doesn't even have particularly great sensory organs itself.\n\nIf you both started in the same room, you could go out for a cup of coffee, take a nap, walk back to the room and intercept the snail crawling towards you, trap it in a jar and study its characteristics. Any special markings, or whatever it might have, anything at all that might distinguish it from a normal snail. You could spend as long as you like on this, pay someone to tag the snail in a way it would be unable to remove, test it to make sure its the right damn snail by salting it, none of that decoy bullshit. You can go out and collect snails of the same species to compare notes.\n\nAfter that? Go crazy. Isolate it so thoroughly that it could never get to you. Don't even tell others about it, you're just a biologist with more money than sense for the better part of a year, hellbent on finding new and creative ways to torture snails. Even if you spend 10% of your funds on this little venture, you're immortal and off to a great start! Figure out how to turn that into real money.",
