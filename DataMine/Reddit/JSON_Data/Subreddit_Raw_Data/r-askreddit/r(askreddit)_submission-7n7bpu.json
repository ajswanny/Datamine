I am a visual being, so in my head, I either see ASL [American Sign Language] signs, or pictures, or sometimes printed words.' For this respondent, sound is not a feature of the experience. Another respondent experiences a mix of modalities: '[M]y inner voice is figuratively speaking to me and I hear it as well as lipread it.' In this case, the experience has both auditory and visual properties. \n\n> [...]\n\n> According to Vygotsky's theory, the process of internalization of linguistic exchanges results in many of the acoustic properties of language being stripped away, resulting in what I have termed 'condensed inner speech'.

    "body": "My dad was born nearly 100% deaf. He had to go to special educational programs to learn how to speak. When he turned 50 years  old he decided to move away from traditional hearing aids and make the leap to a cochlear implant. This is a controversial decision in the deaf community believe it or not-Well that being said he has now had the implant for a few years and things are actually not going as well as you might think. The first issue was his implant was recalled about a year after his surgery. I am not sure how they fixed it but he went through the process to have it replaced. The second issue is the amount of intense physical therapy a deaf person like my dad has to go through to utilize his implant. He has to sit in silence for about 30 minutes a day and attempt to hear new things. From my observation of my dads quality of life since the surgery is that it has not been better more or less the same if anything. My dad says its 50/50 but its difficult at times. What some people may not know is that because my dad was nearly deaf all his life some noises are an overload of information for his brain to process and can actually be extremely agitating for him. My dad has told me on several occasions he cannot tolerate the sound of a plastic grocery bag. I imagine it must be like nails on a chalk board for him. However there has been some fun new sounds he told me about. He said he could hear the little bits of salt pattering on the table surface. And during one of his morning therapy sessions sitting in silence he kept hearing a clicking noise- at first he thought the sink may have sprung a leak so he investigated and could not find where the sound was coming from. Later he discovered is was the clock ticking on the wall which was another thing he had never heard before. Growing up with my dad we had lights for alarms all through out the house including when the phone rang. Every television program we watched included closed captioning-CC is pretty much okay but when you live with it every day of your life it is very frustrating because you can see how often the CC is inaccurate or off timing. But my dad recently told me that when he is home alone and his wife is away he likes to turn off his implant and just sit in total silence. ---He said hearing so much is exhausting for him- Part of me wonders if he regrets getting the surgery because of how difficult it has been for him but he insists its still about 50/50.  When you see the videos of people hearing for the first time -the implant is on a low setting. As the therapy continues the doctor slowly turns it up louder and louder while your brain adjusts to the new information. At first the sensation is overwhelming and according to my dad -at times- is still overwhelming even several years into having his implant. He still cannot hear well speaking on the phone so everything is done via text which is difficult for me because a text does not carry the same amount of weight when I tell him I love him and hope life is going well for him. Texts have little to no soul to them in my opinion. Also he hates going to the movies because he cannot hear a damn thing. I remember the first time I realized how deaf my dad was when I was about 5 or 6 years old. We had just left the theater after seeing The Nightmare Before Christmas. I was happy to have seen the movie and I asked him if he liked the music. He simply said plainly he could not hear it at all. His old hearing aids could not pick up on certain frequencies- often times his hearing aids would pick up feedback and riiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiing for a long time. If no one was there to say something he would just sit there completely unaware of the noise blaring our of his head which is sort of funny but can be really scary if you imagine him being in a place where hearing can potentially save your life. Anyway this is going on pretty long I'll end here. ",

I can 'sense' my surroundings as it is, in place of 'hearing'. With that said there's not a lot of communication in my dreams (spoken words or signs).

    "body": "I wasn't born deaf but I did lose my hearing and memory when I became sick with spinal meningitis at age of 2.5 (bonus irrelevant bit of story; I was pronounced dead). Previously I had vocabulary of estimated 2500 words so that may have subconsciously aided development of my inner-monologue. \n\nMy inner-monologue might seem strange so I would like to give a little story first. I've learn to read lips and speak English long before going to school where I would later learn S.E.E.\u2014signing exact English. I did learn a new way to communicate which is through facial expressions and body language; eventually zeroed in to the lips which was doing the most movements. That is what I couldn't figure out at the time while everything else was easy. For example, an angry face on my father was seen after I was stopped from shooting his friend with bb gun for fun meant great disapproval regardless of how his lips moved. Eventually I began to understand how to read lips through series of events and I do suspect speech therapy played a role because I had to copy their lips in order to better articulate words.\n\nMy inner-monologue is combination of feeling emotions and \"hearing myself\" talk. If I imagine another person talking, it is always my voice that I feel while talking whilst having detailed mind of how to spell each and every words being said. And I am at the same time imagining their lip movements. It's almost as if I am reliving the situation, the temperature, the weather, the emotions, people walking by, etc. \n\nWhen it comes to memorizing sequences of numbers and/or letters, I actually can think of numbers and letters with aid of having memory of my own hand finger spelling or signing numbers to fill in areas I couldn't remember.\n\nSorry, I rarely tell stories and I am lazy when it comes to structuring English to improve understanding for readers so I hope it was understandable.\n\nEdit: someone mentioned how they are in dreams. When I dream, none of that is happening, I am 100% hearing person with full and flawless ability to converse in English reciprocally. I have never had a dream where I am using sign language unless you count the middle finger. \ud83d\udc4d",

The people I have worked with and spent time with directly dislike the word \"disability\" because they don't think that there is anything wrong with them. It's difficult for hearing people to understand that, because we rely on our hearing so much. But deaf people don't, many of them never have, so it makes no difference to them. They can communicate perfectly well through ASL, so they don't see themselves as missing much. My ASL professor always says \"deaf people can do everything hearing people can do, except hear.\" I can also see how getting implants feels like a betrayal to the deaf identity. The whole world is pressuring them to be \"normal,\" and they find solace and kinship in the deaf community. I'm sure people leaving it or making that decision for a deaf child feels like a threat to that community and that safety.\n\nI am hearing, so this is just my small glimpse of understanding into this enormous and rich culture. If anyone knows better, I hope they will correct me. I have no intentions of causing offence. It's definitely a fascinating social subject. \n\nEdit to add: Another thing to consider is that a cochlear implant is not a guarantee of perfect hearing. It's not even a guarantee of *good* hearing. My ASL professor, when she was a kid, her parents tried to get her implants and were told that the implants would actually make her hearing worse, so not everyone is a candidate. Very few deaf people have 100% hearing loss. Think of a cochlear implant as a bypass of the ear. If one gets one, one's ears are rendered 100% useless. So my professor would have ended up with worse hearing, not better. She always said she was glad because people would see her implants and assume she could speak and hear, when that was not the case. Furthermore, an implant put into a small child can end with a child who can speak relatively well. I think they say ages 1-4 are best. An adult who gets an implant is far less likely to adjust to the \"hearing world,\" if you will. ",

But weirdly enough, sometimes I have internal debates with no voice where I'm just pinning one idea up against the other.   \n\n After learning about this whole inner monologue thing I started paying much more to how/if I internally vocalize things. I realized that besides the scenario thing that I actually do have the monologue in very emotional situations, or when I'm reading something with some certain accents (but not aways). I suspect there are times when people *with* an inner monologue have moments where their just thinking with (I don't really know how to say this) just \"concepts\". That's kind of the way I would describe my thinking: mostly just a stream of concepts with some images, an occasional spoken voice or two.  \n\n  \nEdit: And I can read or have the monologue at will, but it feels like it slows things down a lot for me.

So, next time you see someone mention \"blind people of reddit,\" know that it's not a joke! These people [exist by the thousands](https://www.reddit.com/r/Blind/).",

When I hear sounds I see colours, but I don't really \"see\" them.\n\n The part of my brain that usually goes like this: \n\nReal colour wavelenths -> into my eyeball -> interpreted by my brain -> understanding of \"blue\" \n\nAlso can go like this (I think):\n\nSound waves -> stimulation of eardrums -> interpretation by my brain -> understanding of sound + stimulation of part of brain that also produces understanding of \"blue\" \n\nIt's like when you think \"blue\". It's just there in your brain, the word draws it out and you can visualize it. For me, sounds (among other things) can also draw it out and when I hear things I involuntarily have all these colours stimulated as well. They aren't really there, but my brain is interpreting sound as colour as well as sound. But the blue isn't a visual blue, it's an auditory blue, like a feeling of blueness without really being something that can be visualized too easily. ",

    "body": "Right, and ASL also has a different grammar than English. Some Deaf American folks will type online with basically ASL grammar spelled out into words. If you\u2019re familiar with ASL at all, you\u2019ll recognize what some people call Deaf English. It\u2019s generally pretty intelligible to English speakers and might just read as someone who isn\u2019t a native English speaker and doesn\u2019t use English much. People may do this either because their English isn\u2019t strong, or because they just prefer to express themselves ASL and are proud of Deaf culture (much like how folks will toss in Jamaican English, AAVE, Spanglish, etc. even when talking to folks who don\u2019t share the background). \n\nAlso, I\u2019ve been told by Deaf colleagues that many folks find it patronizing to comment on how good their English is, because of course deaf/Deaf people can learn languages, and because schools for the Deaf and integrated schools should both be appropriately educating D/deaf students. But there\u2019s also the reality in the USA that a lot of public education for people who have disabilities and/or are bilingual is sadly lacking. D/deaf adults having low literacy levels is unfortunately common. So, many of us who work in the fields of education/disability/civil rights/etc. encounter a D/deaf person who writes English well, and are kind of like \u201cyesssss!\u201d I do tend to compliment Deaf people\u2019s English, but not in a patronizing way that suggests I didn\u2019t expect them to be competent. More like what you did, waiting until the discussion turns to language or education, and I\u2019ll say something like that since you obviously have very strong English skills, blah blah blah... I make sure not to do what I\u2019ve heard Deaf folks (and other bilingual people and people with disabilities) complain about, which is \u201comg wow you _____ soooo wellll!\u201d the second they open their mouth. \n\n*In the US, \u201cdeaf\u201d refers to anyone with hearing loss, and includes people who primarily use oral language. \u201cDeaf\u201d with the capital D refers to the community who uses primarily ASL and has a shared Deaf culture.

The \"audio\" of such a dream is probably not fundamentally used differently than in audiovisual dreams, though probably has more detail in the functioning senses than normal. \n\nThough it's of course influenced by your habits. A blind person with a habit of listening to audio books probably will have those types of dreams but of course someone similar but with sight might also have dreams where they listen to audiobooks. Not blind or deaf but relatedly, in my case I'm really into film and animation so a lot of my dreams do seem \"directed\" a lot of the time in styles usually similar to the directors I'm most familiar with, but that's still not the majority of my dreams. .

I \"heard\" the front door close, came down to get a sleeping pill(mom would give me one if I had trouble sleeping) and I hadn't slept in three days. I saw her there, fully completely and everything it was exactly like she was there. Like, picture four people, but only one of them is \"fake\" and that's how real it was. It's so different from a hallucinogen hallucination where things are trippy and you can tell things aren't right, it was just bam copy+paste into existence. ",

It's a bit like when you're improvising a song on an instrument; once you know all the chords you just play the song that you want to play, without any planning. Hopefully you'll get it almost right on the first try. But it's still hard to explain how you managed to do it for someone who's used to analyse the chords consciously beforehand.\n\nIt's similar when I'm reading.

I never played with toys and created stories, I just liked to build Lego and K'Nex models. I don't have voices for characters when reading stories.\n\nSo how do I solve problems? If I'm putting together something from IKEA (which I LOVE doing btw) then I just look at the picture and do it. I haven't got any more explanation than that! Can't find a piece? Then I recall places where I might have put it, I don't think to myself \"oh, well I better check the kitchen counter\". Do people do that?\n\nI hope this doesn't come across in a wrong way somehow, I don't want it to seem like I think I'm on some other plane of thinking without the need for words. I wish I was more imaginative because I'm not very creative at all and I wish I was. I think my lack of internal speech is linked to lack of creativity.",

They always were.

    "body": ">Do you literally hear a voice while reading? \n\nI'm not the person you originally directed your question to, but I'd like to answer it anyway. Yes, I always hear a voice in my head that speaks the words as I'm reading/writing. Obviously the voices in my head are capable of talking much more quickly that it is possible for someone to physically say those words, so I can still read very quickly. but I'm still effectively \"listening\" to the story just as much as I'm \"reading\" it. \n\nAnd in all honesty, I grew up under the impression that everyone's mind \"speaks\" the words that they're reading. For example, when I helped teach my sister's children how to read I explained silent reading as just saying the words in their head instead of saying them out loud. They seemed to accept that explanation as logical, and it was how silent reading was taught to me and my classmates in school all those years ago, so I assumed that was how everyone would read books. \n\nThis is only partially related, I suppose I should also mention that I can easily visualize any scene that I'm reading about, so when combined with the fact that I \"hear\" the characters' voices the experience of reading a book actually becomes something similar to watching a movie. I honestly don't know if this is unusual or not, but my experience of reading is like a combination of watching a movie and reading the words in the book. And all this imagery in my head doesn't slow down my reading speed either.\n\nI guess the takeaway of all this is that the human brain is one complicated organ and everyone has their own methods of doing things.

    "body": "I took a speed reading course in high school, and they trained us in this. I can do it, but it\u2019s an effort. My words-per-minute goes up to about 800, but my comprehension drops. They had us outline what we\u2019d read to help us remember it, but if I read it at my normal speed, about 300 wpm, I\u2019d remember it anyway\u2014I gather this *isn\u2019t* normal\u2014so the time involved ended up being about the same. \n\nI do have an internal monologue, not always, but when telling myself to do things (I guess I have a nagging roommate even though I live alone).  But unlike u/TheCloser5225, mine doesn\u2019t sound like my voice. It doesn\u2019t sound like anything much. It\u2019s flat and unaccented. It sounds completely different from my own voice saying the same thing aloud. \n\nNow, here\u2019s where it gets weird. Thinking about this, I have a really hard time remembering what other people sound like. I can describe their tone and timbre, but hearing it is hard. I saw my mother on Christmas Eve, and I remember what we talked about, but I remember in the flat voice, not hers. \n\nAnd further, thinking of music, I can easily remember the lyrics of songs. I\u2019ve never understood just knowing the chorus of a song. Six verses of the Battle Hymn of the Republic. Four verses of the Star Spangled Banner. I couldn\u2019t read Hebrew when I was Bat Mitzvahed, so I just memorized my Torah and Haftorah portions. I can still sing the Torah part forty years later. I always thought this was because I was trained in voice: nine years in chorus and four years of operatic voice. \n\nBut thinking about it, even though I can sing these songs, I can\u2019t hear them in my head. I can\u2019t hear Kenny Rogers singing The Gambler. I know the words, I can sing the song myself. I can sort of hear a warm, dusty, baritone voice start out, but it fades away and I\u2019m back to the flat voice. With songs with no lyrics, like an orchestral piece, I get the main lines if I try hard, but never the full piece with the counterpoint from different instruments and the sub themes. \n\nYou know, my grandparents were huge fans of classical music, and the station was always on at their house. I loved it, but there\u2019s very few pieces I can recognize, despite hearing them over and over. Now I understand that they probably could hear the music in their heads after it played, and I couldn\u2019t, so it was less memorable. \n\nAnd to add to it, my sister and I always got annoyed at our mother, because she couldn\u2019t hear us calling her. We\u2019d say, \u201cMom, mom, mom!\u201d when trying to get her attention in a group, and she wouldn\u2019t respond until we called her \u201cDr. Brahe.\u201d  We used to joke about it, but maybe she really didn\u2019t recognize her children\u2019s voices. \n\nThis thread is very interesting. I know I have some processing disorders, aphantasia and prosopagnosia. I wonder if it\u2019s related. ",
