Danielewski's take on *The Cat in The Hat*\n            \nThe novel begins with a passage which seems, at times,overly detached from the whimsical horror of the anthropomorphized feline. \"The sun did not shine.^1\nIt was too wet to play.\nSo we sat in the *house*\nAll that cold, cold, wet day.\n            \n            \n            \nI sat there with Sally.^2 We sat there, we two.

The fixation Seuss has on the Sun and the lack thereof resembles that of many creation myths, particularly those originating in the cultures of the indigenous American Indians, however this subject has already been addressed at length in other works which would be better explored by the reader than gone into here. Of particular note are *Dr. Seuss and the Prototypical Sun Myth, an Exploration* by S. T. Morganson and *Overcoming Darkness Through Whimsy in the Earlier Works of Seuss* by the aforementioned Morganson and Margaret Nielsen.\n\n2. As a reader of this book I assume you have delved into the more readily available materials on the whole fiasco. Sally's interview with Vogue^4 is particularly easy to find and one of the more telling, the horror and separation she displays are quite real. Other interviews she has done before and after the events with the ~~Cat in the Hat~~ stress the difficulty her and Seuss were having in their marriage, suggesting to some scholars that the entire ordeal was merely an allegory for the struggles of modern marriage and separation anxiety. The mastery with which Seuss weaves her documented quotes with more fantastical meter must truly be noted here, though of course that is more subjective than the subject matter of this document would require. \n\n3. \u02d9\u01dd\u0183\u0250 s\u0131\u0265 s\u0279\u01dd\u0265\u0287o o\u0287 \u0183***\u0287\u0287\u0250 \u0265\u0287\u0131\u028d ***\u0265p\u05df*** u\u0131 p\u01dd\u05df\u0183\u0183*** \u01dd\u028c\u0250\u0265 o\u0287 s\u026f\u01dd\u01dds o\u0265\u028d `\u0279o\u0265\u0287n\u0250 \u01dd\u0265\u0287 \u025fo s\u0287u\u01dd\u0279\u0250d \u01dd\u0265\u0287 \u0265*** s\u028d\u01dd\u0131\u028c\u0279\u01dd\u0287u\u0131 pu\u0250 s\u0279\u01dd\u0287d\u0250\u0265\u0254 \u0279\u01dd\u0287\u0250\u05df \u01ddu\u0131\u026f\u0250x\u01dd \u01dd\u028d s\u0250 \u01dd\u0279o\u026f \u01dd*s \u05df\u05df\u0250\u0265s \u01ddM \u00bf\u0183u\u0131\u05df\u0250\u01dddd\u0250 pu\u0250 \u01dd\u029e\u0131\u05dfp\u05df\u0131\u0265\u0254 os \u0183u\u0131\u0265\u0287\u01dd\u026fos \u0279\u01dd\u0287\u0254\u0250\u0279\u0250\u0265\u0254 s****uo\u026f \u0250 \u0265\u0254ns \u01dd**\u026f \u028e\u0265M \u02d9uo***n\u0254\u01ddds \u0265\u0254n\u026f \u025fo \u0287\u0254\u01dd\u027eqns \u01dd\u0265\u0287 u\u01dd\u01ddq \u028e\u05df\u0279\u0250\u01dd\u05df\u0254 s\u0250\u0265 ~~\u0287\u0250H \u01dd\u0265\u0287 u\u0131 \u0287\u0250\u03fd~~ \u01dd\u0265\u22a5^5\n\n4. You know the drill, there was never a fucking vogue interview with \"Sally\" whoever the hell that is. This old loon seems to have made all of this bullshit up, there was never a book about a cat wearing a goddamned hat. I swear it makes my spine crazy though and my cat has been looking at me strange though, I even called Vogue to confirm all of the Sallies they had interviewed. Watched too many stuck up ladies talking about their new lines of handbags and none of them so much as even mentioned cats. \n\n5. This part is covered in blood or coffee. I was drinking some coffee with a girl last week after work, can't even think of doing so anymore, the bitter taste makes me think of weird clawed beasts with overly fancy headgear creeping at the side of my sight. When I brought her home she said I was tossing and turning in my sleep, scared her right the fuck off which my mumblings about \"disembowelment by beret adorned panthers or some shit.\"\n",

Liz \"Coyote\" Gilbert is reclining on an iron bistro chair, drooling with hunger. Her unshaded legs are whiter than anything the piazza has seen since the days of the Greeks, their doped-up Oracle's prophecy of an undreamt-of albedo come to fruition in a blinding meter between skirt and sandal.\u00a0 \n\n\nShe's jettisoned anything that could keep her from this moment. Husband, family, possessions cast aside in a rush along her inevitable trajectory. But, what's this? Coyote whips up her nose, suddenly alert. The scent of anchovy wafts into the crowd, sending Ms. Gilbert into a feigned swoon.\u00a0 \n\n\nThree waiters approach, struggling to carry the largest pizza Coyote's ever seen. The wrought iron table can barely hold its weight; seagulls start to gather. The pizza is adorned with octopus, sausage of unknown origin, anchovies (some of whom are so fresh they are still struggling against the cheese), mounds of gorgonzola, a thousand-year egg direct from the orient, clams of dubious vintage, and, as a concession to Ms. Gilbert's nationality, great discs of pepperoni exuding grease and gleaming in the sun.\u00a0 \n\n\nThe trickle of drool from Coyote's mouth has become a stream. Her legs are trembling and she gazes into the pie with a look uncomfortably like lust. There is no room in her for anything but the approaching communion. She reaches and bends her body towards the pizza and -- whoops! -- tumbles head first into the cheese.\u00a0 \n\n\nShe easily pierces through the mozzarella, thick strings trailing from her limbs. Octopuses sink with her into the crimson sauce; reinvigorated anchovies wander about. Panicked, Coyote flails, sinking crustward and inhaling a great gulp of sauce. She's shocked to find that she can breathe. Is this some kind of Pizza-yoga? \n\n\nSettling on the crust, Coyote spots a huge circle of pepperoni, myriad flecks of fat and spices patterning its face. Crossing her legs, she contemplates each one, losing all thought in the grease and the flesh. The world ceases to be; all becomes Liz. Anchovies, octopuses, and clams gather to witness the consummation of Liz Gilbert's romance with herself. \n\n\nJust then, the crust starts to rise, a few bits of meat attaching themselves to the tumescence. Are those... legs? A sausage makes its way to the nascent body as Liz starts to eye with naked hunger what's looking more and more like a man. The dough of his body has become well defined bicep and deltoid; there's definitely some transubstantion going on here. Comedite hoc est corpus meum, don't mind if I do. \n\n\nWhen the golem is finished, fine mozzarella hair framing his perfect features, Coyote can no longer restrain herself. She embraces him, nibbling at his ears, his throat, his cheek. Sauce racing through his veins, he throws his arms around her as her mouth and teeth explore his body. She shudders as he enters her; biting down on his shoulder, Coyote's never felt so full.\u00a0 \n\n\nShe can't stop herself; she devours spiced flesh and crusty bones alike, until with one last kiss her love is a delicious memory. Left in the crust below is a gap through which the sauce is slowly leaking. Freedom! Coyote wiggles her way out into the Naples afternoon, cheesy and sauce-sodden, but serene with satiety. ",

In fact, pretty much everything I read about myself is ridiculous. Newspapers write that I'm spoiled. All I do is dance on tabletops and party with my friends. They think I became famous because I was born into a rich, well-known family, and everything has come as such to me. They like to think everything they read about me in the tabloids is true. Well, you can't always believe what you read. I've decided to give you a sneak peek into my life -- so you can know the real me.\n\nI haven't bothered to correct what's written about me. Gossips believe whatever they want anyway. The people I care about know the real me. I'm happy with who I am. What difference does gossip make?\n\nThat's the bottom line for me. The printed stuff about me over the last few years is amusing and makes me laugh. I've decided to let the world know: Okay, I get it. Everyone can have fun with my image because I have fun with it too. My friends know I like my lifestyle, but I don't take it -- or my media image -- seriously. I take my family seriously. I take my dog, Tinkerbell, seriously. I take my work seriously. But I don't take myself seriously.\n",

Since the surplus-value = \u00a390, and the advanced capital = \u00a3500, we should, according to the usual way of reckoning, get as the rate of surplus-value (generally confounded with rate of profits) 18%, a rate so low as possibly to cause a pleasant surprise to Sam-I-Am and other harmonisers. But in truth, the rate of surplus-value is not equal to s/C or s/(c+v), but to s/v: thus it is not 90/500 but 90/90 or 100%, which is more than five times the apparent degree of exploitation. Although, in the case we have supposed, we are ignorant of the actual length of the working-day, and of the duration in days or weeks of the labour-process, as also of the number of Whos employed, yet the rate of surplus-value s/v accurately discloses to us, by means of its equivalent expression, surplus-labour/necessary labour the relation between the two parts of the working-day. This relation is here one of equality, the rate being 100%. Hence, it is plain, the Who, in our example, works one half of the day for himself, the other half for the capitalist.\"",

He had remembered all the clocks in his childhood being twelve-hour clocks, and they served him just fine. Many of the Party's greatest minds were said to have spent a great deal of time mulling over the necessity of clocks that strike thirteen, though the rest of Oceania never got an answer. Most of those minds had a nasty habit of vanishing in the middle of the night along with their bodies.\n\nNot letting his thoughts on unusual chronography distract him, Winston slipped quickly through the glass doors of Victory Mansions, though not quickly enough to prevent a swirl of gritty dust from entering along with him. The hallway smelt of boiled cabbage and old rag mats, which, for an entire country that seemed to smell like such, was a notable commendation. At one end of it a coloured poster, too large for indoor display, had been tacked to the wall. It depicted simply an enormous face, more than a metre wide: the face of a man of about forty-five, with a heavy black moustache and ruggedly handsome features. \n\nWinston made for the stairs. It was no use trying the lift. Even at the best of times it was seldom working, and at present the electric current was cut off during daylight hours. It was part of the economy drive in preparation for Hate Week. If the intent was to develop hatred toward the use of stairs, the Party was performing admirably as usual. \n\nThe flat was seven flights up, and Winston, who was thirty-nine and had a varicose ulcer above his right ankle, went slowly, resting several times on the way. On each landing, opposite the lift-shaft, the poster with the enormous face gazed from the wall. It was one of those pictures which are so contrived that the eyes follow you about when you move. *BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU*, the caption beneath it ran in large, unfriendly letters.\"",

Harry Potter lived with his aunt Petunia Dursley and his uncle Vernon Dursley and their fat little chickenshit of a son, Dudley Dursley. And a dud Dudley was, making his namesake as close to prophetic as you better fucking believe it could be, you see.\n\nOne day, Harry Potter had had enough of Dudley Dursely's horse shit, so in a fit of anger, he took a cleaver to the fat boy's face (a merciless operation if ever there were one), the *Magic* coming to the forefront of his mind from some dark, cobwebby recess in the back of his dark and troubled imagination, in a bright flash of crimson (The *Magic* is coming back, coming back, Harry Potter thought, the idea giving him both unimaginable terror and a hard on). The Dursley boy's nose came straight off, blood gushing in an arc across the kitchen table and Dudley Dursley clutched the bleeding fat stub of his nose and he ran, squealing, from the room like a pig narrowly evading slaughter.\n\nVernon Dursley, coming down the stairs to investigate, spotted a letter at the base of the front door: Hogwarts School for Witchcraft and Wizardry, the envelope read. \"Cod swallow,\" Vernon Dursley said, and chucked the letter into the fire before attending to his son's hemorrhaging nasal region. Vernon Dursley spotted Harry Potter dart toward the bedroom under the second-floor stairs (a bedroom the size of a spice cupboard but more of a bedroom Harry ever thought it could be) and he grabbed the boy by his hair, raked him three times on the face and yelled, \"HARRY POTTER, GET THE FUCK OUT OF MY HOUSE THIS INSTANT!\"\n\nHarry reeled backward and in a fit of raw and terrible emotion, he imagined Vernon Dursley's head exploding in a bright flash of red and gore and bone. (The *Magic* is coming, the *Magic* is coming.)\n\nAnd it did.\n\n(Edit: spelling and minor alterations.)",

Replacing the M26 used in the Korean War and the outset of combat in Vietnam, the M67 contains nearly a half pound of Composition B.

The grenade was live. He had roughly 4 seconds before detonation. He tossed it underhand into the darkened hut. There was no \"cooking off\", popularized by movies, tv, and video games. Like silent \"thwips\" of suppressors and the constant re-racking of bolts, Hollywood needed to dramatize the mundane action of prepping a grenade. As if the violent twisted metal flakes perforating anyone within 30 meters of the blast area wasn't dramatic enough. Piggy hadn't the luxury to continue to dwell on it. He knelt down behind the makeshift cover of the stone pile until he heard the familiar thud of the lethal explosion. There was no fireball. Another Hollywood trope he failed to comprehend. Only smoke and the acrid smell of detonation. \n\nRalph lay in a pool of ever expanding blood. He clutched his throat as blood pulsed from a severed artery. His eyes were closed and a small section of his ear hung on by a single flap of skin. Piggy walked to him to see him writhe in agony. \n\n\"It won't be long now\" he muttered to him self. \"Die with some dignity.\" \n\nRalph's convulsions slowed as his grip on his neck weakened. Piggy took a step back to avoid the blood annexing the dirty planked floor. He never liked watching people die, but after the situation in Tunisia and the jumblefucked Operation Mantis Topaz, he was going to verify every kill. ",

In this way, /u/ketryne's post rejects the duality of man and how he chooses to accept the unpredictability of life and potential possession by demonic forces.  While one would assume a Suessian narrator would overcome such forces with colorful illustrations and zany rhymes it soon becomes apparent that this will not be the case.\n\nIn the first stanza the author very rationally sets the scene for the rest of the poem. The only exception is the term \"glook\" which hints at the Suessian journey the reader is about to embark on.  However, the lack of rhyme or meter sets the tone that something is slightly off with the narrator.\n\nThe second stanza continues to toy with the reader, implying that the unreliable narrator sees \"it.\" The final line of the poem hits the reader like Chris Brown after a night of drinking, as the reader realizes that the narrator has been overtaken by the darkness.  This leads the reader to the poem's final conclusion, that there is nothing holding society together except a thin veil of sanity and that the only duality which man has is which insanity he will feed.",

So this hellish nephew of mine, who ended up killing himself, as he should've, after pissing off the unspeakable horror that killed his parents. \n\nIt all started 17 ruddy years ago during my perfect son's 12th or something birthday, we had gotten him a generous amount of presents and of course that venom blooded scurge from my sister in law's loins was jealous because he never got presents, obviously. Being the nice guardians to this ingrate that we were, we offered to take him to the zoo, and what does he do, he talks to a snake and orders it to try and kill our wonderful, cherub of a son. \n\nTurns out, this putrid spawn of Satan was a magic casting wizard, like the harlot that was his mother. I'll tell you what though, when his invitation to a school for whores and degenerates came in the mail, we of course destroyed it. However after days of destroying new letters day after day, one of those days those terrorist filths from the axis of magic decided to bombard my wonderful house with these abominable letters. \n\nSo of course we did the one thing that every good parent does and moved to a light house in the middle of goodness knows where - which given how barren of life it was, we were probably in Scotland. Then, on a night housing an ominous full moon, a lightning storm swept the lands, the front door exploded into splinters and who, nay, what stood there was a giant indescribable monstrosity who brutalised my son, who never did one thing wrong in his whole life, and set the poor child on fire. It then spoke intelligible gibberish to my wife and I, which clearly made her distressed - almost zombie-like honestly. \n\nThat nephew of mine, the evil incarnate that he was, of course frolicked yonder with that fowl beast, happy as I'd ever seen him, off to learn those devilish incarnations. My beautiful wife, astray from reality, grabbed a charred bone once belonging to our spectacular, determined, genius son, and thrusted it into her jugular, I watched her bleed to death - she made no noise, not even a whimper or a goodbye. \n\nI knew he would return, he would pretend to be my nephew, and I his uncle and I would play that part, get close to him, and one day, I will do unto him as he did unto me. I would end that Harold Potter, even if I went mad.\"                           ",
