Their goal was to get Trump elected and they are doing their job. I'm mad at the fucking Democrats. You know why?\n\n> Because [every1](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/may/29/bernie-s/bernie-sanders-says-he-polls-better-against-donald/) [single2](http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/general_election_trump_vs_sanders-5565.html) [fucking3](http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/why-does-sanders-do-better-clinton-against-trump) [poll4](http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/2016-general-election-trump-vs-sanders) showed Clinton neck and neck with trump and Bernie out way ahead. Clinton isn't losing because she's a democrat, she's losing because a lot of her actions have been dishonest and people don't trust her. \n\n> That's where Sanders has the big advantage. Even many Clinton supporters admit that they don't like her but they are only voting for her because they like Trump less. What a glowing endorsement. That's why Bernie was a better candidate but the Democrats had to have their queen and now they reap what they sow. Now I know many people will argue that since Clinton > Sanders and Trump > Clinton that means that Trump > Sanders. This is incorrect thinking for a number of reasons. \n\n> Clinton was able to win the primary because she controlled the liberal leaning media and because the Democratic party worked against Bernie Sanders during the primary. \n\n> CNN, MSNBC, NY Times and many liberal comedic pundits were very much biased towards her. This can have a profound impact on a race and drive many supporters away from Sanders to Clinton (even if they didn't like her).\n\n> CNN was mocked as the Clinton News Network because of how biased they were against Sanders and many \"comedic\" pundits like Samantha Bee, Seth Meyers, and others were quick to bash Bernie and his supporters while ignoring the flaws in Clinton. Bernie Bros spread like wildfire even though the Bernie camp had more women in it than the Clinton camp. Clinton also adopted similar language to what Bernie Sanders was saying in order to woo Bernie supporters away from him. So, while they didn't rig the electoral ballot, they sure put all their effort into crushing Bernie's movement instead of trying to understand why Bernie was getting so much support. After he lost Clinton went back to business as usual and Trump catered to Bernie's supporters and tried to woo them.\n\n\n> But wait, if it's true that Clinton controlled so many media outlets and tv shows then why is she losing (maybe did lose depending on time of reading)? By your logic, she should be crushing Trump. Here, lies the biggest flaw in the Democrats plan. They could influence many liberal leaning networks to show Clinton favoritism but Republicans don't watch those shows. A hard core Republican doesn't care about what Samantha Bee has to say. They don't care about MSNBC. So that magical lead that Clinton could force over Sanders (barely) wasn't there against Trump. And the fact that Clinton and the Democratic Party worked so hard to trivialize Sanders' supporters ended up biting them in the ass as many did not want to come out and support her. You want to mock and trivialize me so much? Fine, now you get your wish, I am non-existent in this race. \n\n> To put it simply, the Democrats misread the situation and didn't realize the anger boiling up against the establishment. The second they won the primary they shifted tactics to wooing Republicans rather than sticking to Sanders' message because it never occurred to them that Sanders' supporters wouldn't want Hillary. They assumed that Sanders' supporters would just fall in line (like in races before).\n\n\n> So, yeah, Fuck CNN, Fuck the Democrats, and Fuck the new wave of shitty late night comedic pundits. They are cancerous fucks who did everything they could to push out a populist candidate and elect their hated candidate. They deserve what they got.\n\n\n> P.S. Everyone who thinks that this race was decided by Comey's letter about the email investigation being reopened is probably wrong. That was released too close the election time to sink in. Most Republicans will feel vindicated (but they're not voting for Hillary anyway) while most Democrats will feel distrustful of the letter. He released it right next to the election time. This is probably a setup to crush Hillary. I won't fall for it. So, yeah, I doubt it had much effect on the election but it will most likely still be a scapegoat for the loss (instead of researching the real reasons).\n\nEDIT: Link to where I saw it from: \nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5byarw/selfmeta_i_have_no_dog_in_the_fight_but_let_this/d9sd49p/?st=ivamy8r5&sh=7d6b740a\n\n",

But it's so much more than simply being a problem with other people being idiots, and ourselves being blameless. Both parties and even the \"Corporate Media\" we always hear so much about have severely underestimated the anger and resentment Americans feel right now. This is not about any specific problems, but at the idea of events like, for example, a Democratic Party deciding people will fall in line and vote for their candidate simply because they're not as bad as \"that guy\", or that the Republican Party would continuously try to drop taxes on the wealthy and block social reforms Americans seem to feel strongly about, among other, possibly more egregious transgressions by both sides.\n\nThis election isn't about Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. This election has been about which party tapped into that anger better. The Democrats had a candidate that people felt understood their anger, and the Republicans eventually were pushed into nominating theirs, but the forces acting upon both parties are no different. For just a second, forget the platforms that are, in fact, more important than anything else. Don't forget that the Republicans had to be strong-armed into nominating Donald, just as the Democrats fought against nominating Bernie. On both sides, people are fighting to change the status quo and fighting to keep it. People feel they have been played as pawns; Therefore, they wish to provide the checkmate. If you are wondering how this possibly could have happened, it's because in the course of history the wrath of the people will always be answered, whether it be peacefully, militarily, culturally, or in some other way. This wrath has been created through a underestimating of the people, a dismissal of them, a belief that they can be controlled and will follow like a puppy to its master. We can only hope the wrath is answered favorably.",

Isn't it a problem when your president runs on a platform that seems impossible to implement?\n\nSecond, and more seriously, is Trump still planning to deport ~12 million people? Is the plan for that still deportation squads? \n\nThird, has Trump said whether his plan for ISIS involves missiles, or boots on the ground, or anything like that? I've only heard \"we're going to take them out and then get out\". Which leads me to:\n\nFourth, does Trump plan to do ANYTHING in terms of the stability of Iraq, and how does he feel about Assad and the situation in Syria in general? \n\nLastly, has Trump refined his view on global warming so that it's no longer a Chinese hoax? Or is he still going on with that stuff? Like, even if you're the type to not think that global warming is caused by man, that's at least more understandable than saying it was all a ruse made up by the Chinese...",

    "body": "Here's where the Democrats fucked up:\n\nYou know which Democratic presidential candidates have won elections? Those that came out of left field. If you asked Joe Schmoe's opinion on Carter, Bill Clinton, and Obama 4 years before they were elected President, they most likely would've received a \"Who?\" and a quizzical look. And yet, those three candidates would hold the highest office in the land within an election cycle. This strategy is so sound that it even happened in the GOP convention with Ronald Reagan in 1976.\n\nBy comparison, establishment candidates -- such Gore, Kerry and Hillary -- come off as too elitist for middle America.\n\nThere may be some junior senator or little-known state governor buried deep in the speech list at the 2016 Democratic National Convention who might be up for the job. It unfortunately can't be a woman unless she's a successful governor of a conservative state like Texas, Kansas or Georgia. Shitty as it is, it most likely needs to be a little-known-but-successful male governor or senator from the midwest.",

It amazes me how much words like racist, misogynist, homophobic, etc. are being thrown around completely ineffectually, both now and during the election. This, to me, signifies that the impact of those words has decreased significantly, that they are losing their power completely. I don't welcome that. It's a change brought about by those words being abused to the point of meaninglessness. Somewhere along the line, it was discovered that those words have power over others, that they can be used to make empathetic individuals do what you want, in order to avoid being labeled with them.\n\nTrump is a result of that abuse. His campaign only grew stronger as people started throwing slurs at him and his followers. Instead of engaging them, and explaining one's position to them, many simply chose to yell incoherently at them, to cry wolf as it has been done for so long now. And I know that there are many who will say that those people don't deserve to be treated with kindness and debated with. That they're bigots and their minds won't change, and blah blah blah. What those people don't realise is that their mindset is exactly why Trump is president now. And until it changes, until people are capable of starting a dialogue instead of spouting rhetoric and slurs, the sentiment that caused him to win this election will linger and grow stronger.\n\nSo I hope, for all of our sakes, that this particular brand of zealotry will soon end.",
