He wanted to get the CIA to quash the investigation.\n\nThe memoirs of H.R.

There's no question that the FBI knew a lot about him, they would have investigated him heavily when he came back from the USSR. It's entirely plausible that he had some contact with the CIA or with CIA assets at some point in that weird career.\n\nSo I can entirely easily imagine that, as soon as word came out that Lee Harvey Oswald was the (a?) shooter, the FBI's counter-espionage director and the CIA covert operations director both asking their subordinates, \"Fuck, did one of our assets just kill the President? is this somehow our fault?\" And then both of them ordering full clamp-downs and cover-ups, not because they knew that their own people had killed the President, but just in case they had.",

I do think it's an interesting thing to think about, though.\n\nAnyway. True stuff: On February 26, 1993 a Ryder truck full of explosives was set off in the parking garage beneath the World Trade Center. Contrary to what I thought as a kid, it actually did cause some significant damage. There were holes in several underground floors and damage to heating, cooling, and electrical components under the building. Several teams of analysts determined there was no structural damage, so everything could be rebuilt and the building remain safely in operation.\n\nThe benevolent conspiracy theory: After this attack, the government wanted to know what would happen if the structure of the WTC was damaged. From small scale tests, simulations, and data from earthquake disasters, they realized that the falling towers - the tallest structures in the United States - would cause extensive damage and loss of life as they toppled into neighboring buildings. If they broke from the ground and toppled (unlikely, but maybe possible), tons of concrete, steel, and glass would have free-fell onto people, streets, and other buildings over 1,300 feet away.\n\nAside from the tragedy, the economic impact could have spelled ruin for New York City. The numbers from the actual 9/11 disaster show that NYC's GDP dropped by over $30 **billion** for the 15 months following the attacks. Extrapolate that out to a much larger disaster.\n\nAlright, so that's sort of conspiracy, sort of common sense. I'm willing to bet someone *did* do that research. On to the crazy stuff, but I think you see where it's going.\n\nDuring the repairs from the 1993 bombing, perhaps the WTC really was wired for controlled detonation. Not for a false flag attack, but in the even that **any** disaster (another terror attack, some rogue tidal wave, whatever) caused the structure of the WTC to be unsound. On 9/11, the government waiter for the initial evacuation to be mostly complete before detonating the charges, thereby saving countless lives, buildings, and NY's economy.\n\nSo, like I said, **it's fiction**.

    "body": "When talking about ballistics, the Coriolis Effect refers to the deflection on the trajectory of the bullet generated by the spinning motion of the Earth. Its effect is negligible at medium distances, but becomes important around 1000yds and beyond, especially because it can add to other minimal errors and keep you off target.\n\nCoriolis effect affects everything not firmly attached to the Earth\u2019s surface. It affects fluids, like air and water, as well as floating and flying objects like ships, airplanes and\u2026 bullets.\n\nDespite being associated with Coriolis, the phenomenon that actually affects the vertical component of the trajectory is called E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Effect. The rotation of the Earth generates a centrifugal force, the same that pushes you to the side when you make a sharp turn with your car. This force acts perpendicular to the Earth rotatory axis, adding or subtracting to the gravity force. When an object flies eastward, in the same direction of Earth\u2019s rotation, centrifugal force acts opposite of gravity, pushing it away from the Earth\u2019s surface. If the object flies westward, in the opposite direction of the Earth rotation, centrifugal force pushes the object toward the ground concurrently to gravity force. Thus, bullets fired to the east always fly a little higher, and, conversely, bullets fired to the west always travel somewhat low.\n\nThe amount of drop change is in function of:\n\nLatitude \u2013 The linear velocity of a point on the Earth\u2019s surface, and thus the amount of centrifugal force, is maximum at the equator and decreases going toward the poles, where it is null.\n\nShooting direction, or azimuth \u2013 The amount of drop change is highest when shooting east or west, and as the trajectory angles north or south,  the amount of drop change decreases, becoming null, as the angle points toward either pole.\n\nMuzzle velocity \u2013 The amount of centrifugal force is determined by the speed of the flying object.\n\nBefore, I mentioned that the vertical element associated with the Coriolis effect is actually called the E\u00f6tv\u00f6s effect. To give you an idea how the E\u00f6tv\u00f6s effect alters a trajectory, here\u2019s an example. Let\u2019s say you\u2019re firing a .308 175gr bullet, with a muzzle velocity of 2700fps, from a latitude of 45\u00b0. The drop at 1000yds will be 392 inches, shooting either to the north or south (without error). Shooting with an azimuth of 90\u00b0, or eastward, the drop will be 388in. Shooting with an azimuth of 270\u00b0, or westward, the drop will be 396in. In either case, there is a total change in drop of 4in. An easy assumption is to predict that, when shooting with an intermediate azimuth, that the drop change will be linear. This is incorrect. Instead of a 2in change for an azimuth of 45\u00b0, the error is a function of the sine of the azimuth angle. For those of you who don\u2019t have a fondness for trigonometry, this essentially means that you have half the error at 30\u00b0 rather than at 45\u00b0. Changes in latitude have a minimal effect, since at the equator, where the effect is greatest, the error would be 5in, only one inch more than the error we calculated at 45\u00b0 latitude.\n\nWhat is most affected by Coriolis Effect is the horizontal component of the bullet trajectory. Because of the Coriolis effect, every moving object not connected to the ground is always deflected to right in the Northern Hemisphere, and always toward left in the Southern Hemisphere. The deflection is not east or west, but specifically to the right or left with reference to the shooting direction. It doesn\u2019t matter in which direction you shoot; it is a function of latitude and average bullet speed. Its effect is maximum at the poles, and decreases as one moves toward the Equator, where it is minimal. The explanation of this phenomenon is more difficult than the explanation of E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Effect, so I won\u2019t go into it into detail.\n\nHere\u2019s an expample of error due to Coriolis effect: firing the same .308 175gr bullet at 2700fps muzzle velocity, from a latitude of 45\u00b0 in the Northern Hemisphere, the deflection at 1000yds will be of 3in to right. At the North Pole, where the effect is maximum, the deflection will be a little more than four inches. The deflection will be the same in the Southern Hemisphere, but it will be to the left, instead.\n\nAs you can see, these errors are subtle, even when shooting long distance.However, especially when combined with other potential error factors in your long distance shooting equation, it could make the difference between hitting and missing your target. If you have portable ballistic software, you can use it to calculate Coriolis for you at every distance. But, if you\u2019re doing the math on your own, I wouldn\u2019t start to take Coriolis into consideration unless shooting at 1,000 yards, or more.",
