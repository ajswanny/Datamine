    "body": "The systematic, scientific, concentrated battle for our attention. App notifications, Skinner box games, easy access to diversion at all times via our phones, lack of silence due to music streaming, podcasts, audiobooks, etc. We are being trained out of being able to handle stillness and silence, and our brains aren't designed to handle constant anxiety and jumping of attention from thing to thing without a feeling of completion. Basically all streaming services now autoplay, most popular games are infinite (Clash of Clans, Hearthstone, Bubble Witch, etc), most people work in the service industry so they don't get a feeling of a completed job.\n\nI'm not sure how I would shorten this idea, but the prevalence of machine-learned delivery of instant gratification aimed at our psychological weak points available at our fingertips at literally all times probably isn't going to help us deal with the awkwardness that is real life relationships between us with each other, and us with the world.\n\nEDIT: I'm happy to wake up this morning and see that this has resonated with many people. Here are some sources I have used to inform and equip myself to begin to overcome the mindless loss of control I have had over my own mind.\n\n[First, a short video to grab your attention. (heh)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edx9D2yaOGs) (Thanks u/woxianghekafei)!\n\n[The manipulative tricks tech companies use to capture your attention | Tristan Harris](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C74amJRp730)\n\n[Quit social media | Dr. Cal Newport | TEDxTysons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3E7hkPZ-HTk) - \"I am a Millenial, computer scientist, book author, standing on a TED stage, and yet I have never had a social media account.\" - Dr. Cal Newport\n\n[Deep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World](http://calnewport.com/books/deep-work/) - By Dr. Cal Newport, the speaker in the above talk. Fragmented attention is a serious issue for people nowadays, both for their mental health as well as their earning potential. Rates of self-reported generalized anxiety are very high, especially in the younger generations, and Dr. Newport attributes part of that to social media, and the smart phone, app notification, attention-grabbing economy in general.\n\n[Switch: How to Change Things When Change Is Hard](http://heathbrothers.com/books/switch/) - In *Deep Work*, Dr. Newport talks about concentration being a muscle that needs exercise. This book discusses how our willpower is more like a tank of gas; you have a finite amount of it, and you need to let it fill back up occasionally if you want to use it. If you find yourself glancing at your phone constantly when you are trying to read a book, or watch a sunset, or sit at dinner with friends, there are more and less effective ways to train yourself to both be less distracted by your phone, as well as not have that anxious feeling that even though you are not looking at your phone you *really want to*. Instead of keeping it on silent in your pocket, why not turn it off and put it in a drawer in your room while you read a book in the living room? If you are at dinner, turn your phone off and give it to someone else and ask them to give it back before you leave. If you, as the book puts it, \"shape the path\" to more easily get you what you want, you will find yourself exerting less willpower and feeling less anxiety to achieve the same goal.\n\nEDIT AGAIN: Okay, I've fielded questions and discussed related topics in responses for a couple hours now. I hope this discussion has at least given people something to think about or relate to, and possibly even given some motivation to change if they feel it is needed. I'm turning off notifications for this post to respect my own personal time. If anyone has any other questions I recommend discussing them with a friend or loved one in person, especially if you feel like you are alone in having these feelings of anxiety or distraction. You can also check out some of the great resources myself and others have posted in this thread! Thank you everyone for your participation! Have a good day. :)",

However, our lungs are made to take in oxygen, nitrogen and the other elements that make up our atmosphere. Nothing else. Pot is better than cigarettes in the sense that it is not drenched in however many chemicals that cigarettes are. However, smoking is smoking. Your lungs are not made to intake carbon monoxide and ash. Even THC for that matter. I know its from the earth, and thats great. So is tobacco. Smoking anything is not good for you.\n\nNow I hear all you guys typing \"Nahh man I dab and its healthy bc its just THC concentrate and there is no carbon monoxide.\" You are right! But do you think putting what is essential oil so hot it vaporized; in your lungs is a good idea? It sounds like a way to cook them from the inside out.\n\nIm no scientist, just a stoner. But that is my two cents. I am an imperfect human so Im going to go light up now. \u262e\ufe0f \n\n\nAlso please correct me if I am wrong. Most of this is just things I have collected and manifested myself over the years. I hope I am wrong. And I am aware of the medicinal uses of pot. I think edibles are probably the way to go in most cases. ",

What will society be in 20, 50, 100 years when this generation's children grows up with the pressure of being online since practically birth, and seeing so many people become popular so quickly and consistently, more than any other time in history. That's why it seems like celebrities are dying so often, is because we're so connected that there's so many more people to know about. Just long-term, how will our basic, natural psyches evolve because of this. I know there's a lot to unpack here, I just always wonder.",

There are some studies that suggest that television is best left out until age 2 because the brain needs time to develop. There aren't any long term tablet/iPad studies that I am aware of, but I doubt it is beneficial. It's a quick way to entertain a toddler, which is part of the problem. Kids need to learn how to be bored. The alphabet, counting, and reading can wait. \n\nEdit: Wow. I didn't expect this comment to blow up. I think it's important to note that I am not judging parents who use an iPad to entertain their kids. If that works for you and you think it helps your kid, go ahead and do that. No one is stopping you. My older kids actually do use my wife's iPad on occasion. My 8 year old has taught himself new songs on the piano, how to ride a unicycle, how to solve a Rubix Cube, and creates his own Rube Goldberg machines thanks to the internet. He also swims, golfs, bike rides, plays baseball, etc. It's not all or nothing and I agree with that. I just think toddlers/preschoolers are better served interacting with their environment. At best, it makes no difference. At worst, it harms your child. Maybe it won't make a difference, but I am not making my toddler a guinea pig for this experiment. ",

For example - like most people I played games similar to Farmville and was hooked on the reward system. I played games such as Castleville, Boombeach, Clash Royale, Mafia Wars (first and second), Adventure Capitalist, Bitcoin Miner, and so many others. After a while of going through these games though, I finally looked at the screen and thought \"What on earth am I doing? This is just a timed reward system wearing fancy clothes that requires occasional input to keep the clock going.\" Ever since that realization, I just have had no desire to download any games that utilize this style of play. If I download a game not knowing that it is designed this way, I'll just be thinking \"not this shit again\" and uninstall it.\n\nI guess I'm writing this wondering if these types of games will always be around at great capacity, or if they will fade away like the olden days of trusting salesmen and totally believing corporate advertising (if it was ever like that) - we'll have it in our culture to know better.\n\nWhat makes me think yes is that a lot of the people from overseas that I work with fall prey to common sales tactics at dealerships/during home buying because they really just don't know any better because they aren't form around here. I have no doubt it would be the same way if I went to where they were from with other things.",

And I think everyone was taught that, and most of us found out that no one gives a shit what we think...They say it\u2019s the \u2018me\u2019 generation. It\u2019s not. The arrogance is taught or it was cultivated. It\u2019s self-conscious. That\u2019s what it is, it\u2019s conscious of self. Social media is just the market\u2019s answer to a generation that demanded to perform, so the market said \u201cHere, perform everything, to each other, all the time for no other reason.\u201d It\u2019s prison, it\u2019s horrific. It\u2019s performer and audience melded together. What do we want more than to lie in bed at the end of the day and just watch our lives as a satisfied audience member?

The gift their SO got them. All the happiness they experience. They don't see all the mundane shit that that person does just like everybody else. They don't see them post about the bird that took a shit on their car they just washed on the way to the lake. The fact that they stubbed their toe on the table at dinner and got a stain on their favorite dress, or the fact that their SO and them haven't slept in he same bed for 3 weeks.\n\nThey see all this happy and compare it to their mundane and it plants seeds in their minds. \"Why can't I have all that?\" \"Why can't I be as happy as them?\" \"Why isn't my life as good?\" \"What's wrong with me?\"\n\nThis spreads and spreads until they are full on clinically depressed. \n\nI don't have any data to backthis up but it's just something I've been thinking about for a while. \n\nEdit: apparently it's well documented.

What if parents explained to kids that porn is about as real as wrestling? What if parents got over their weird fear of explaining sex to their children, and taught us that real sex is awkward, and beautiful, and fumbling, and genuine, and amazing?

Baby Einstein is still contributing to that child's development of language, just not as much as say playing with your baby in person and talking to them for example.\n\nIf we compared Baby Einstein children to those who received extremely minimal exposure to language, Baby Einstein kids would look like an improvement. \n\nWhen it comes to education, it's not that certain things \"harm\". Education in general is a good thing. The question is really if this new educational method is actually better than what we were doing before. Because Baby Einstein still has value as an educational tool regardless. It just turns out as an educational tool, it's not as valuable as other things.\n\nEdit: Fixed a typo, since this comment blew up.",

You're entirely motivated by *outside* forces, rather than your own *internal* goals.\n\nIts like the hedonic treadmill but sort of worse because you can only get ahead by capturing OTHER people's attention, and always more and more of it.\n\nWith that said, the people that are constantly self-promoting are also, by definition, the ones we see most often, while the quiet, unassuming people will do their thing out of the public eye.

I like the idea of self-starting a personal brand on social media and gaining traction, but it's quickly spiraled into narcissism. \n",

For example, a 1-standard-deviation increase in \u201clikes clicked\u201d (clicking \u201clike\u201d on someone else's content), \u201clinks clicked\u201d (clicking a link to another site or article), or \u201cstatus updates\u201d (updating one's own Facebook status) was associated with a decrease of 5%\u20138% of a standard deviation in self-reported mental health.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1089/cyber.2016.0259  \n>this study provides causal evidence that Facebook use affects our well-being negatively. By comparing the treatment group (participants who took a break from Facebook) with the control group (participants who kept using Facebook), it was demonstrated that taking a break from Facebook has positive effects on the two dimensions of well-being: our life satisfaction increases and our emotions become more positive. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that these effects were significantly greater for heavy Facebook users, passive Facebook users, and users who tend to envy others on Facebook.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0069841  \n>We text-messaged people five times per day for two-weeks to examine how Facebook use influences the two components of subjective well-being: how people feel moment-to-moment and how satisfied they are with their lives. Our results indicate that Facebook use predicts negative shifts on both of these variables over time. The more people used Facebook at one time point, the worse they felt the next time we text-messaged them; the more they used Facebook over two-weeks, the more their life satisfaction levels declined over time... Rather than enhancing well-being, however, these findings suggest that Facebook may undermine it.\n\nTL;DR: Delete Facebook, Hit Jim, Lawyer Up.",

It never ceased to amaze me at how far people would go to avoid something that is literally for their health and safety. \n\nPersonally,  hearing protection messes with my ears. With 12-16 hr days 7 days a week both ear plugs or ear muffs each caused different issues. Ear plugs would hurt my ear canal after two weeks or so and muffs would chaffe so I'd switch between them. Some jobs required both because they're so loud. IDGAF how uncomfortable it is though. Those little hairs inside never grow back once damaged. I'll sacrifice being cool now so I can be the old person with good hearing later on. ",

Also, Kansas City vs NY is very different  haha\n\nI enjoyed my longer commute because I could listen to a full podcast in the car. Do you find you can recharge during that 2 hour commute or is it just annoying? There were  no phones or devices were allowed past the break area. That also meant I couldn't respond to the wife's texts once I was at work. So the 45 minutes were nice-ish to me.\n\nMy new employer has the motto of \"what ever makes you happy, makes me happy, as long as it isn't destructive to you or the company.\" Which is cool, because I can take care of the smaller things in life that I couldn't at another job. Like running home to let the dog out and being a few minutes late from lunch, take a phone call, or just step outside for some fresh air. ",
