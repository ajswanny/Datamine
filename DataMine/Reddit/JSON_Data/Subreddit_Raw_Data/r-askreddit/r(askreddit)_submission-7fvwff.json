From what I've gathered it is a perfect storm of several things that happens to *ahem* \"poor\" drivers:\n\n1) They are afraid to hit the gas. In residential driving you almost never need to really floor it. Revving the engine up makes it make loud scary sounds like you're gonna break it. It makes people scared. They would prefer to accelerate at the same pace that they normally do in all other aspects of their driving. And in a little economy sedan that just isn't enough to get up to the right speed on the straightaway.\n\n2) They are unwilling to accelerate in the clover part of the onramp, because again accelerating while turning  and experiencing those sideways forces is scary and you normally never do it in residential driving. If they don't won't want to floor it on the straightaway they really ought to accelerate out of the clover and be at 40-50 before they even hit the straightaway, then they would have been able to comfortably get up to the 60-65 you need to be going to merge... but people don't want to accelerate while turning so they end up too slow when it's time to merge \n\n3) People are afraid of fast highway speeds because they are accustomed to the slow driving on residential roads that they were just doing. It naturally \"feels too fast\" and they are driving based on their gut feelings instead of objectively evaluating the traffic around them.\n\n\nWhat drives me absolutely bonkers though, are the people who slowly poke up the onramp causing traffic behind them and THEN they accelerate all the way up to 80 and fly down the left lane weaving in and out of traffic. Like not only are you speeding your ass off but you JUST demonstrated how little grasp of the traffic around you you have. You're a menace!",

No warnings or excuses, the only benefit I gave them was using the least point value or $ fee traffic citation (-1 point or $30). Hoping I was doing my part in making the roads safer for \"you all that run into these critters\"....but there's hoards of people out there that I can't comprehend how they survive day to day living seeing what they do or excuses i would get.\n\nFor the 30mph on-ramp drivers- my observation was they own the road mentality. Thinking it's the other persons fault for driving the speed limit and not reacting. or that the YEILD sign meant other driver shall yield to their decision... \n     One of my little joys to the job was morning shift, doing what was called \"Checking the Interstate making sure it was still there\" (no stranded motorists, hazards, signs/rails not damaged...) During this check I would pay special attention to the X-overs (authorized vehicle use only, Interstate U-turns). Everyday/night someone will try to use them at highways speed essentially making a 90 deg. left turn going 70 mph. The skidmarks going straight into the bushes/guardrail always made me smile. They always left without reporting the accident and a week later claim the car was stolen or vandalized due to the damage to insurance. Guess I got grumpy after working who know how many accidents resulting from the bad driver taking a X-over and then the good driver getting rear ended from slamming their brake to avoid them...Only one wreck was I able to chase down the guy that started these chain reactions by using an X-over...6 insurance companies then going after 1 company. No experience with them but his insurance company name was a military rank...I'm sure everyone had to pay out of pocket due to him\n",

    "body": "After reading your linked comment, I agree with most of it, but strongly disagree with the high RPM part. \n\nObviously you are correct about the efficiency stuff, which is why looking at BSFC maps is the right way to evaluate the best way to accelerate. You're also right on about the high torque, most BSFC maps show peak efficiency when torque is at around 80% of its maximum for that RPM. But BSFC maps also tend to show peak efficiency at about 2000 RPM. [A quick google search](https://www.google.com/search?q=bsfc+map&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjBxI33oN_XAhUrqlQKHc9qBtUQ_AUICigB&biw=1920&bih=949#imgrc=IzfAAi37hr1JcM:) produces a huge number of BSFC maps, as you can see at least 80% show peak efficiency between 1500-2500 RPM. In most cars 2000 RPM is going to mean unacceptably slow acceleration on an on ramp, but something like 2500 with high torque will probably be enough while still being close to maximum efficiency. \n\nEdit: After rereading your post, we may just be using different definitions of high RPM, I'm not sure.

The problem is, however, that I am one of those people who needs landmarks and reminders because I'm zoned out focusing on traffic and whatnot. \n\nI once drove an entire two hours out of my way because I was just following familiar landmarks, feeling smug about how I remembered the way, only to get to my destination and remember I wasn't GOING THERE, I was going somewhere else. I had to get out my map and figure out a way to get back to this back road in the country where I was supposed to be at my family reunion, avoiding construction and detours not on the map. This was before I had a cell phone, so everyone thought I was dead.\n\nI also hail from small town Midwest USA and have massive anxiety, so I don't drive well in \"regular\" traffic, let alone actual heavy traffic. For that I just have to read a book in the passenger seat and pretend none of it is happening. Driving alone in Chicago was only possible because we'd just gotten a GPS and I didn't have to worry about reading the map and managing traffic and finding the address of the hotel I was going to. \n\nBut the absolute best realization I've ever had probably stemmed from that 2 hour detour. **It's okay to miss your turn.** *It's not like you're now on a road to Canada with no exits.* Sure you might be a little late, but it's okay. You'll get there. Don't panic and drive stupidly, just keep going and be safe. Find the next turn and get out a map. Or if you're lucky, just let the GPS cuss you out and fix the route. \n\nEdit: Thanks for the gold, you generous stranger! I honestly thought this would get buried and like maybe 2 upvotes. I'm glad to know I'm not alone in my driving anxiety!  \n\n--Also. I'm super sorry about my offhand Canada comment, y'all. I live smack dab in the middle of the US and rarely travel to the borders, so it's literally over 700 miles to escape North, and 1,300 miles to escape South. 2,000 to get out of here by boat to the Pacific, and 1,000 to the Atlantic (Please don't dox me). My personal biggest worry is a toll road with too few exits.  I apologize to those of you who've accidentally left your country. Also for possibly insulting Canadians. You are majestic.
