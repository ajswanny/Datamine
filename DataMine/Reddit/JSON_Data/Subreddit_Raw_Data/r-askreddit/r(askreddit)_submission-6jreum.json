You decide to troll the film world by making a movie so ridiculous anybody defending it would look like a tool. What's your plotline?:\n\n\n\n> On the surface it looks like a period piece set in the 60's -70's. A man in prison (Joeseph Gordon Levitt) struggling with depression. In his cell, contemplating suicide, he begins recounting his troubled childhood to his cellmate, Micheal Cane.\n\n> We go quickly through his younger life, a child on a farm with 4 siblings, a strict father and a distant mother. The family moves to the city, where he gets bullied for being a hick. He finds solace reading old military books. Using tactics from his book, he and a group of misfit friends defeat the bullies.\n\n> Cut to prison where he is still considering suicide, staring at a homemade noose. Michael Cane urges him to continue.\n\n> He then relates dropping out of school, and traveling with some hippies led by Ellen Page, whom he is in love with. She flirts but keeps him at a distance. He has a knack for painting. This act focuses on his pursuit of Page, trying to get close to her through art until it is revealed she is a lesbian, when he walks in on her with another woman. \n\n> Dejected, he leaves the group.\n\n> He tries to get into a prestigious art college to avoid the draft but is rejected. He gets drafted. Standard military \"War is Hell\" montage interspersed with him in prison crying. Cane is not consoling, but tells him some wise Michael Cane words about life being a struggle and it is our choice to live or die.\n\n> He gets out and on a chance encounter meets back up with Page. She is now part of a political activist group. Having nowhere to go he joins them. With his strict fathers upbringing, love of history, charisma and military service he becomes the face of the group. They plan to hold a huge rally. At the rally he gets arrested. At trial, Page backstabs him to get her charges dropped, and he gets 5 years.\n\n> Back to Cane and Levitt. Hes been in jail almost a year and is considering suicide. Cane, who we thought all along was talking him down, is actually urging him to hang himself. A back and forth of dialog ensues, culminating in Cane attacking Levitt and putting the nose around his neck. Levitt, now wanting to live,fights him off. Just then the guards appear to break up the fight. They also announce he is getting early release.\n\n> Cut to Levitt being released from prison. Making his way down a long hallway. He passes by Canes cell, where he has a defeated look on his face. The camra lingers on the cell and Cane says to someone offscreen. \"I've failed. I tried to stop you but I've failed. Father help us all.\" Camera pans to reveal Ellen Page, in the shadows smirking in the corner of the jail cell.\n\n> As Levitt exits the prison a sepia tone takes over the screen. We see we are not in 1970's America, but 1920's Berlin. As Levitt walks down the street a free man, we see brief shots from his past, redone in a style appropriate for the 20's. All scenes with Ellen Pages have her replaced with Cillian Murphy. He enters a beer hall and is greated by cheers from his former protesters, now wearing swastika armbands.\n\n> You realize you just spent 2 and a half hours rooting for Hitler.",

    "body": "Post by u/sozaiix3:\n\nI have this comment saved too, it's from a askreddit thread very long ago I don't have the source anymore, very insightful, here's a similar one about growing old:\n\nI asked my grandpa what it felt like to grow old. Grandpa is a man who will deliberate on which part of the newspaper to start with each morning, so I knew my question would take him some time to answer. I said nothing. I let him gather his thoughts.\n\nWhen I was a boy, Grandpa had once complimented me on this habit. He told me it was good that I asked a question and gave a person silence. And being that any compliment from him was so few and far between, this habit soon became a part of my personality and one that served me well.\n\nGrandpa stared out the window and looked at the empty bird feeder that hung from an overgrown tree next to the pond he built in the spring of 1993. For twenty years, Grandpa filled up the feeder each evening. But he stopped doing it last winter when walking became too difficult for him.\n\nWithout ever taking his eyes from the window, he asked me a question: \u201cHave you ever been in a hot shower when the water ran cold?\u201d I told him I had.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what aging feels like. In the beginning of your life it\u2019s like you\u2019re standing in a hot shower. At first the water is too warm, but you eventually grow used to the heat and begin enjoying it. But you take it for granted when you\u2019re young and think it\u2019s going to be this way forever. Life goes on like this for some time.\u201d\n\nGrandpa looked at me with those eyes that had seen so much change in this world. He smiled and winked at me.\n\n\u201cAnd if you\u2019re lucky, a few good looking women will join you in the shower from time to time.\u201d\n\nWe laughed. He looked out the window and continued on.\n\n\u201cYou begin to feel it in your forties and fifties. The water temperature declines just the slightest bit. It\u2019s almost imperceptible, but you know it happened and you know what it means. You try to pretend like you didn\u2019t feel it, but you still turn the faucet up to stay warm. But the water keeps going lukewarm. One day you realize the faucet can\u2019t go any further, and from here on out the temperature begins to drop. And everyday you feel the warmth gradually leaving your body.\u201d\n\nGrandpa cleared his throat and pulled a stained handkerchief from his flannel shirt pocket. He blew his nose, balled up the handkerchief, and put it back in his pocket.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a rather helpless feeling, truth told. The water is still pleasant, but you know it will soon become cold and there\u2019s nothing you can do about it. This is the point when some people decide to leave the shower on their own terms. They know it's never going to get warmer, so why prolong the inevitable? I was able to stay in because I contented myself recalling the showers of my youth. I lived a good life, but still wish I hadn\u2019t taken my youth for granted. But it\u2019s too late now. No matter how hard I try, I know I\u2019ll never get the hot water back on again.\u201d\n\nHe paused for a few moments and kept looking out the window with those eyes that had seen ninety-one years on this Earth. Those eyes that lived through the Great Depression, those eyes that beheld the Pacific Ocean in World War II, those eyes that saw the birth of his three children, five grandchildren, and seven great-grandchildren.\n\nHe had indeed lived a good life, I thought to myself.\n\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s what it feels like to grow old.\u201d\n\nEdit: Link to thread - https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/5cwzhn/comment/da0m5q2",

    "body": "Posted by u/rhoner about 6 years ago. \n\nThis is just the absolute best thing I've come across on reddit. (this and the rice kid) \n\nGonna copypasta it as it is :\n\nJust about every time I see someone I stop. I kind of got out of the habit in the last couple of years, moved to a big city and all that, my girlfriend wasn't too stoked on the practice. Then some shit happened to me that changed me and I am back to offering rides habitually. If you would indulge me, it is long story and has almost nothing to do with hitch hiking other than happening on a road.\n\nThis past year I have had 3 instances of car trouble. A blow out on a freeway, a bunch of blown fuses and an out of gas situation. All of them were while driving other people's cars which, for some reason, makes it worse on an emotional level. It makes it worse on a practical level as well, what with the fact that I carry things like a jack and extra fuses in my car, and know enough not to park, facing downhill, on a steep incline with less than a gallon of fuel.\n\nAnyway, each of these times this shit happened I was DISGUSTED with how people would not bother to help me. I spent hours on the side of the freeway waiting, watching roadside assistance vehicles blow past me, for AAA to show. The 4 gas stations I asked for a gas can at told me that they couldn't loan them out \"for my safety\" but I could buy a really shitty 1-gallon one with no cap for $15. It was enough, each time, to make you say shit like \"this country is going to hell in a handbasket.\"\n\nBut you know who came to my rescue all three times? Immigrants. Mexican immigrants. None of them spoke a lick of the language. But one of those dudes had a profound affect on me.\n\nHe was the guy that stopped to help me with a blow out with his whole family of 6 in tow. I was on the side of the road for close to 4 hours. Big jeep, blown rear tire, had a spare but no jack. I had signs in the windows of the car, big signs that said NEED A JACK and offered money. No dice. Right as I am about to give up and just hitch out there a van pulls over and dude bounds out. He sizes the situation up and calls for his youngest daughter who speaks english. He conveys through her that he has a jack but it is too small for the Jeep so we will need to brace it. He produces a saw from the van and cuts a log out of a downed tree on the side of the road. We rolled it over, put his jack on top, and bam, in business. I start taking the wheel off and, if you can believe it, I broke his tire iron. It was one of those collapsible ones and I wasn't careful and I snapped the head I needed clean off. Fuck.\n\nNo worries, he runs to the van, gives it to his wife and she is gone in a flash, down the road to buy a tire iron. She is back in 15 minutes, we finish the job with a little sweat and cussing (stupid log was starting to give), and I am a very happy man. We are both filthy and sweaty. The wife produces a large water jug for us to wash our hands in. I tried to put a 20 in the man's hand but he wouldn't take it so I instead gave it to his wife as quietly as I could. I thanked them up one side and down the other. I asked the little girl where they lived, thinking maybe I could send them a gift for being so awesome. She says they live in Mexico. They are here so mommy and daddy can pick peaches for the next few weeks. After that they are going to pick cherries then go back home. She asks if I have had lunch and when I told her no she gave me a tamale from their cooler, the best fucking tamale I have ever had.\n\nSo, to clarify, a family that is undoubtedly poorer than you, me, and just about everyone else on that stretch of road, working on a seasonal basis where time **is** money, took an hour or two out of their day to help some strange dude on the side of the road when people in tow trucks were just passing me by. Wow...\n\nBut we aren't done yet. I thank them again and walk back to my car and open the foil on the tamale cause I am starving at this point and what do I find inside? My fucking $20 bill! I whirl around and run up to the van and the guy rolls his window down. He sees the $20 in my hand and just shaking his head no like he won't take it. All I can think to say is \"Por Favor, Por Favor, Por Favor\" with my hands out. Dude just smiles, shakes his head and, with what looked like great concentration, tried his hardest to speak to me in English:\n\n\"Today you.... tomorrow me.\"\n\nRolled up his window, drove away, his daughter waving to me in the rear view. I sat in my car eating the best fucking tamale of all time and I just cried. Like a little girl. It has been a rough year and nothing has broke my way. This was so out of left field I just couldn't deal.\n\nIn the 5 months since I have changed a couple of tires, given a few rides to gas stations and, once, went 50 miles out of my way to get a girl to an airport. I won't accept money. Every time I tell them the same thing when we are through:\n\n\"Today you.... tomorrow me.\"\n\ntl;dr: long rambling story about how the kindness of strangers, particularly folks from south of the border, forced me to be more helpful on the road and in life in general. I am sure it won't be as meaningful to anyone else but it was seriously the highlight of my 2010.\n",

This guy was the definition of NOT a morning person; he's still half asleep, bleary eyed... basically a zombie with a bagel.  He sits down across from me to eat his bagel and is just barely conscious.  My back is to the outboard side of the ship, and the morning sun is blazing in one of the portholes putting a big bright-ass circle of light right on his barely conscious face.  He's squinting and chewing and basically just remembering how to be alive for today.  It's painful to watch.\n> \n> But then zombie-OPS stops chewing, slowly picks up the phone, and dials the bridge.  In his well-known I'm-still-totally-asleep voice, he says \"heeeey.  It's OPS.  Could you... shift our barpat... yeah, one six five.  Thanks.\" And puts the phone down.  And then he just sits there.  Squinting.  Waiting.\n>   \n> And then, ever so slowly, I realize that that big blazing spot of sun has begun to slide off the zombie's face and onto the wall behind him.  After a moment it clears his face and he blinks slowly a few times and the brilliant beauty of what I've just witnessed begins to overwhelm me.  By ordering the bridge to adjust the ship's back-and-forth patrol by about 15 degrees, he's changed our course just enough to reposition the sun off of his face.  He's literally just redirected thousands of tons of steel and hundreds of people so that he could get the sun out of his eyes while he eats his bagel.  I am in awe.  \n> \n> He slowly picks up his bagel and for a moment I'm terrified at the thought that his own genius may escape him, that he may never appreciate the epic brilliance of his laziness (since he's not going to wake up for another hour).  But between his next bites he pauses, looks at me, and gives me the faintest, sly grin, before returning to gnaw slowly on his zombie bagel.",

Here it is for those that don't want to open extra tabs:\n\n\"I grew out of it, but ill share my ex-racism.\n\nI grew up in Wendover. The population was 85% Mexican, and they were all wannabe gangsters and fake-ass drug dealers. Teen pregnancy started at 14-15, and graduation rate from High School is around 35 out of 300. I'm a white, nerdy little shit, and was consistently getting bullied and beat up. I eventually grew to understand that Mexican meant asshole while living out there.\n\nI finally moved away, and enrolled at a different school. I felt kinda weird no longer being a 'minority'. In school, I had a homeroom class and sat next to a Mexican kid (Juan-Carlos). I treated him like shit. I had mentioned to one of his friends my experiences in Wendover, and he told Carlos.\n\nOne day, Carlos was listening to.me treat him like shit, and he snapped. He got up, stood in front of my desk, slammed his fist down and breathed out slowly. Then he smiled at me.\n\n\"I understand your anger. If I met those assholes at your last school, I'd hate my culture too. Please remember that I am proud of my heritage, and if you hate us, you hate me, but I'll never hate you.\"\n\nI was embarrassed. Being yelled at by somebody you've been talking shit about all the time...\n\nI stood up, and got ready to sock him. I got used to getting in fights when somebody confronted me, I was ready to fight him.\nThis motherfucker hugged me when I stood up. He fucking hugged me.\n\nWeird as fuck, but I've never forgotten it. Ever since, we've been friends.

    "body": "This response to a thread about what you'd do if a nuclear weapon hit 5km away:\n\n> Well, I'm not dead. That tells me a number of things.\n\n> For starters, I have a pretty good idea that we're at war with Canada right now. Also, I'm pretty sure that the rest of the country is toast and that some distinctly weird shit is going down.\n\n> I'm 5 clicks from bupkis. There's nothing worth hitting within probably five times that range from where I am right now and even that is charitably a tier 3 target even from the Soviet perspective.\n\n> Back in the day the Russians operated a 40 kiloton warhead which was delivered by the SS-3 missile system; it's since retired but, as pretty much the only warhead that was operated by not-the-united-states, survivable from 5km out, and delivered by missile I'm pretty sure that's what the strike was from. The SS-3 isn't terribly sophisticated as ballistic missiles go and it's probably in pretty poor repair on account of being decommissioned since 1969 but given that someone's nuking rural southwestern Virginia, the re-appearance of a 45 year old atomic weapons system is hardly the strangest thing about today. At least it explains why there's a surplus of developable land in my little mountain town; the SS-3 never was tremendously accurate.\n\n> The bad news is that, accurate or not, the SS-3 is an intermediate range missile with a maximum range of about 750 miles. That's about 1200 km in communist units. Since the SS-3 isn't sea-launchable that leaves a launch site somewhere in the continental United States or southern Canada -- somewhere around Toronto or Ottawa; it's a theater weapon, so my guess is Toronto.\n\n> The Canadians are invading; I always knew this day would come.\n\n> It could be the Russians invading through Canada but that seems a bit of a stretch. Invading Canada without anyone noticing would be difficult, even if you were good at hockey and very polite. Setting up a disused missile system within spitting distance of Detroit while still maintaining the charade of being our Poutine loving neighbors to the north beggars the imagination. No -- it's far more likely that, fearing a Donald Trump presidency, the Canucks have decided that it's aboot time to deal with the United States before things go even further off the rails and this is the fumbled first strike - an apologetically ineffectual weapon purchased in oil shale money from some Eastern European arms dealer.\n\n> The interstate will be a ruin after the blast and areas north are far more logical targets. My van's old though; it should still run despite the EMP and I have an hour or so to get clear before the fallout becomes a problem. I slip off my shoes and walk in sock-feet to my vehicle -- better to ditch the potentially radioactive socks than to be without shoes -- and prepare to head west through the Jefferson National Forrest before swinging south.\n\n> We'll regroup in Georgia, down below the gnat line, and use the weather to our advantage. They'll be sapped by the heat and, with a little luck, we can push them back north of the Ohio river by next Thanksgiving, though I expect it'll be a sparse one.\n\n> No maple syrup in the sweet potato casserole, that's for sure.\n",

    "body": "The perspective of the Jenny in Forest Gump\n\nThis is way late, but it needs to be said.  \n\nJenny from Forrest Gump. She gets so much goddamn flak from people who have seen the movie. It's like they tuned out completely at the normal human experience just because they think Forrest is adorable.  \n\n**Jenny didn't think she was in love with Forrest because she thought she was taking advantage of him the same way her father molested her.**  \n\nFor fucks sake, Forrest is retarded. Jenny, out of everyone who's ever met him, knows this best of all. She knows that her closest friend and only loved one is a fucking idiot. Imagine that. Imagine for one second that the only person who was always kind to you was someone who didn't know any better. Everyone in the world who knew about your father looked at you either as a victim or as something disgusting, but that one man doesn't. \n\nAnd it's because he's retarded.  \n\nJenny doesn't think that way at the start. As a kid, she just thinks he's different and is just glad to have a friend. But as she gets older, especially as a teenager, she realizes that her closest friend will never mature like she does. He loves her like he would anything and everything else, so long as its nice or cuddly, like a pet or a sibling, at least in her mind. Her father treated her like shit, and there was no way in hell others didn't do the same when they found out she was molested. She would have wanted to feel loved.  \n\nThat's where she gets the abusive relationship crap. She wants so much to be loved that she doesn't understand that they are taking advantage of her. She thinks that as long as they aren't forcing her to have sex, that's normal. Getting beat on, pressured to drug addiction, and dragged around into whatever dangerously extreme political bands they're into is just fine, as long as they don't rape her. That's why she's so shocked when Forrest defends her from harm. Why would anyone do that if what they're doing to her is normal?  \n\nShe keeps leaving Forrest behind because she convinces herself that he doesn't really love her. She convinces herself that his affections are shallow, since he would never be able to really understand love either. I mean really, how many of you honestly think someone who is that mentally challenged could understand the complexities and nuances of love? There's no way they could. What they have is something simple, and Jenny doesn't think that could be real.  \n\nAnd even IF she believed he could, even IF she got out of that abusive cycle, *she knows better*. FFS, if that scene with Forrest and her in her college dormroom had the genders reversed, people would be so fucking uncomfortable about that scene because it'd be inching so close to rape. Jenny knows that. She realizes that. That is why she shuts off her feelings for Forrest, above any other reasons to stay away: she thinks she is molesting him. She saw how uncomfortable he was when she did that and thought *holy fuck, what the hell am I doing?*  \n\nCan you imagine how twisted you must feel after realizing in that moment that you turned into the father who molested you? How the fuck can you love yourself after doing that to your best friend, when you know what that's like? Would you ever let yourself get close to them again if you really cared about them?   \n\nSo Jenny kept running away. Every time Forrest gets close and saves her, she runs off before she falters. She won't let herself get near him, and as the movie goes on, she fails a little more each time. First she blows him off after the strip club, telling him to stay away. Then she walks with him in DC, but still leaves with her boyfriend. Then she stays with him in his house and finally sleeps with him, after that one critical moment.  \n\nWhen he tells her he does know what love is, and asks her why she doesn't love him.  \n\nShe finally gives in and does sleep with him, but can you imagine thinking afterwards? Would you, in her shoes, with absolute and unwavering certainty, think you did the right thing? Or would you be afraid that you did exactly what you had been avoiding because you *do* actually care that much about him?  \n\nSo she runs away. She hides her child from him, because she thinks he shouldn't have to worry or pay for something he can't handle. She thinks she's wronged him, and the least she could do is set things right by raising a good child, without dragging him down.  \n\nAnd then she gets sick. Doctors don't know what it is, but she's going to die. Her kid is only a few years old. Can you imagine struggling with that decision to tell your *victim* that they have a kid and now they have to take care of it because you're going to die? That's what she struggles with before coming to terms with the fact that she's happy with him, and he's happy with her, and *that's what love actually is*. It's something *simple* and unconditional, and even Forrest can understand it.  \n\nIt takes her her whole goddamn life to figure out that love is just that simple, and she dies months afterwards. She realized she had been running away from what made her happy, and it *isn't wrong*, and she only gets so much time together before it's over.  \n\nAnd instead of realizing that narrative even exists in the story, people just bitch about how Jenny is such a slut, but she won't even love the only person who cares about her. Jenny always loved Forrest, during the whole fucking movie. She loved him so much, she thought she was taking advantage of him and ran away for his sake. She didn't realize she was wrong until it was almost too late.  \n\nFuck, that's depressing.   \n\nEDIT: Obligatory gushing, but actually I just wanted to add a TL;DR:\n\n**TL;DR**: Jenny thought she was molesting Forrest because he couldn't understand what love is, so she either suppressed her feelings or ran away.

Believe me - I know what it's like to dislike your body. I got zapped in Iraq and I've got some unsightly scars, and I sometimes struggle to accept that I'll never be as physically capable as I used to be. Fucking sucks sometimes.\n\nAnyway...I wish I could let you into a man's head as he's falling in love with a woman. It's a process that's so alien, so strange, that I'm afraid you've got to experience it to believe it. But it's as real as death and taxes....\n\nSometimes, a guy will meet a gal and think nothing of it. Maybe she's a co-worker, classmate, or his buddy's friend. She gets mentally categorized as \"Female, acquaintance, feelings neutral\". Then, he gets to know her better. If they mesh personality-wise, something fascinating happens in the man's mind. He starts to notice things about her appearance - pleasant things. It starts small - one day he realizes he likes looking at the curve of her nose, or where her ear lobe meets her face.\n\nIt's nothing he can put his finger on or describe, really...just that looking at that part of her makes him feel good. He starts wanting to do that more. Then, he notices an expression she makes - could be her genuine belly-laugh, or the way she furrows her brow in concern - and he gets a little flutter in his chest.\n\nThey stay friendly for awhile, get to know each other better.\n\nThen, one day, she hugs him goodbye....and he can't stop thinking about it. He plays it over and over in his head - the feel of her breasts through two shirts, her arms around his back, her smell...he finds these little mental movies of her playing unbidden when he's driving somewhere, squeezing out his other usual daydreams.\n\nShortly thereafter, the guy realizes that whenever he looks at this woman, he feels good. He likes her lines, her curves, her sounds and smells...\n\nIt's like she's gradually turned from a black-and-white photo into a 3D color movie with surround-sound - a perfect movie that makes him feel good. He starts wondering what he can do to keep her around, to make her happy. He realizes that he likes looking at her more than any other human being in the world.\n\nTo him, she is perfect and beautiful.\n\nA man in love with a woman doesn't see her objectively. There is a filter there, or some kind of participatory illusion. He does not see who you see in the mirror. He is seeing someone beautiful and perfect and sublime, and it's one of the most powerful things in his life.\n\nGo watch a happy old couple that's been married for decades. Watch the man's eyes. Sure, he may appreciate some young woman's ass in yoga pants or whatever...but watch his eyes when he's looking at his spouse. If you're paying close enough attention, you can almost see the filter click on when his gaze settles on her. In that moment, he's not seeing the same frumpy empty-nester that you or I see - he's seeing something wonderful.\n\nNo shit. If I hadn't lived this stuff, I wouldn't believe it either. But it's true.\n\n     ",

It is a dark brown colour, and it is mostly oval shaped. If you run your fingers over it (cute girls reading this, I highly recommend this activity, for science), then you wouldn't feel it. It is very much a part of my skin. In fact, it's like one tiny part of me, on the shaft of my penis, is brown. I wouldn't go as far to call me African-American, however, as I'm very much white and Australian, but, as a child, it did make me wonder...\n\n>Now, my older sister, let's call her Rebecca, is a twin, technically, but her twin died while it was still developing in the womb. So she's not really a twin. But, anyway, Rebecca has a mole on her neck. This mole, my mother used to say, was the undeveloped fetus. My childhood brain believed this to be the case, that, when people died, they'd attach their crumpled and tiny bodies onto other living beings as a slightly unsettling method of attaining immortality, and guide their living host through life. A little bit like a guardian angel.\n\n>My grandmother used to work with Indigenous Australians in remote communities in outback Australia. One day while at her house, she decided to go through her photo album. Most of these photos had three things in common - my grandmother, my grandfather, and a black man. I ask my grandmother who the black man is. \"That's Robert, woodenial.\" \"Well how come I've never seen Robert before?\" \"He's gone.\" \"Gone where?\" My grandmother paused for a moment. She wanted to say this delicately to a six year old. \"He's dead.\" \"Oh\" \"He died about the same time you were born.\" I asked my mother about this when I got home, she could confirm.\n\n>Now, let's cast our mind back to two paragraphs ago and recall the belief that dead people attached themselves to the living. With this belief in mind, we shall head back to my penis. We should head to the little brown spot on my penis, to be exact. I came to a sudden realisation that night in my bed when I got home. The brown freckle on my penis was a dead person. Robert was also a dead person, who happened to have dark skin. I put two and two together and came to the only logical conclusion: Robert is my phallus-bound guardian angel.\n\n>tl;dr a dead man, Robert, inhabits the shaft of my penis as my guardian angel.\n\n[Original link](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/3bcd9y/what_is_the_most_embarrasing_thing_you_could/cskxnk1/)\n\nEDIT: Wow, that's the quickest I've been gilded at only 1 upvote.",

    "body": "/u/lupinthe8th wrote this on an ask reddit thread about ideas for a depressing pixar film 3-4years ago.\n\nlink: https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1zmme1/z/cfv8o5x\n\nA teenage boy and his girlfriend. They are happy and very in love, but tragedy strikes; the boy gets drunk at a party, drives home with her, gets in an accident, and she is killed. He feels horrible, naturally.\n\nBut the girl isn't gone; she returns to the world as a ghost, not willing to pass on and be without her love. Unfortunately, he can neither see or hear her. She can whisper things in his ear and be perceived subconsciously, move small objects when he isn't looking, but never make her presence really known.\n\nFor a while she is content to simply follow him around and comfort him as best she can. It even seems she may be having a positive effect; she is able to subtly influence him to quit drinking, clean up his act, and turn his life around. All seems well in a bittersweet way.\n\nThings start to change as time passes. The boy gets older, the ghost does not. He starts to move past her death, no longer gazing longingly at the pictures of them together, not visiting her grave as much. While the ghost wants to see him happy, she is miserable that she is being forgotten, as she is unchanging and still feels love for him.\n\nA few years pass, and the now young adult man starts dating other women. The ghost is upset and jealous. She starts to sabotage his dates, causing little accidents, using her ability to be subconsciously heard to make him say awkward things, basically being a bitch and ruining the young man's relationships. \n\nUnable to find happiness, the young man begins to backslide. He starts drinking again, he gets in fights, he loses his job. His life is turning to shit. Ghost girl feels terrible...until one night the man takes too many sleeping pills and almost dies. A horrible plan occurs to her; if he commits suicide then he'll be dead too and they can finally be together.\n\nShe starts to egg him on to more and more self-destructive acts, whispering poisonous thoughts in his ear, trying to make him hate himself. He shuts out family and friends. He buys a gun and doesn't really know why. The girl hates to do this, but it's the only way...\n\nThroughout the film, we've seen other people haunted by ghosts. At first this seems harmless; there's a man whose father still follows him and gives advice. A mother who lost her daughter, but the girl still walks around holding her hand. The spirit of a young boy's dog still romps behind him. These ghosts can see each other, and are the typical Pixar cast of quirky side characters. \n\nAt last the young man seems to hit rock bottom and is ready to end it all. Not wanting to watch her love die, the ghost departs to leave him to it. She heads to the park, and sees some of the other people with ghosts. But now she notices things she hasn't before. The ghostly father's advice, always critical, seems downright abusive, constantly berating his son for his failure and inadequacy, and the son looks miserable. The little girl's mother can't look at a child playing without tearing up. The ghost dog is gone, however, and the now older boy has a new pet and is happy. The girl realizes that what she is doing is wrong.\n\nShe rushes back to the man, who is moments away from shooting himself. She begs him not to go through with it, pleads and cries, but is unheard. Eventually she is just barely able to direct his attention to the neglected photos of them together as happy teenagers and he puts the gun down, picks up the phone, and calls a suicide hotline.\n\nMan enters therapy, joins a group to quit drinking again, takes medication. It's long and hard but he makes it. The girl is happy, but she seems to be fading slowly as the months pass. She thinks she might be finally letting go and crossing over, her reward for having saved him. Eventually she departs with a smile.\n\nTwist ending: there was no ghost. That was his guilt and depression personified. It was always his own subconscious, the part of him that hated and blamed himself for the girl's death. Sure, the guilt drove him to quit drinking once, but the fact that he couldn't move on drove him into ever deeper despair. All the people with \"ghosts\" are the same way, haunted by their pasts. Last shot is him walking down the street, content, but as we zoom out we see just how many of the people around him have ghosts, and how widespread the problem is.\n\n  ",

    "body": "I really enjoyed this about Koalas...  from /u/AndromedaPrincess\n\nKoalas are fucking horrible animals.\nThey have one of the smallest brain to body ratios of any mammal, additionally - their brains are smooth. A brain is folded to increase the surface area for neurons. If you present a koala with leaves plucked from a branch, laid on a flat surface, the koala will not recognise it as food. They are too thick to adapt their feeding behaviour to cope with change. In a room full of potential food, they can literally starve to death. This is not the token of an animal that is winning at life. Speaking of stupidity and food, one of the likely reasons for their primitive brains is the fact that additionally to being poisonous, eucalyptus leaves (the only thing they eat) have almost no nutritional value. They can't afford the extra energy to think, they sleep more than 80% of their fucking lives. When they are awake all they do is eat, shit and occasionally scream like fucking satan.\nBecause eucalyptus leaves hold such little nutritional value, koalas have to ferment the leaves in their guts for days on end. Unlike their brains, they have the largest hind gut to body ratio of any mammal.\nMany herbivorous mammals have adaptations to cope with harsh plant life taking its toll on their teeth, rodents for instance have teeth that never stop growing, some animals only have teeth on their lower jaw, grinding plant matter on bony plates in the tops of their mouths, others have enlarged molars that distribute the wear and break down plant matter more efficiently...\nKoalas are no exception, when their teeth erode down to nothing, they resolve the situation by starving to death, because they're fucking terrible animals.\nBeing mammals, koalas raise their joeys on milk (admittedly, one of the lowest milk yields to body ratio... There's a trend here).\nWhen the young joey needs to transition from rich, nourishing substances like milk, to eucalyptus (a plant that seems to be making it abundantly clear that it doesn't want to be eaten), it finds it does not have the necessary gut flora to digest the leaves. To remedy this, the young joey begins nuzzling its mother's anus until she leaks a little diarrhoea (actually fecal pap, slightly less digested), which he then proceeds to slurp on.\nThis partially digested plant matter gives him just what he needs to start developing his digestive system. Of course, he may not even have needed to bother nuzzling his mother. She may have been suffering from incontinence. Why?\nBecause koalas are riddled with chlamydia. In some areas the infection rate is 80% or higher. This statistic isn't helped by the fact that one of the few other activities koalas will spend their precious energy on is rape.\nDespite being seasonal breeders, males seem to either not know or care, and will simply overpower a female regardless of whether she is ovulating. If she fights back, he may drag them both out of the tree, which brings us full circle back to the brain:\nKoalas have a higher than average quantity of cerebrospinal fluid in their brains. This is to protect their brains from injury... should they fall from a tree.\nAn animal so thick it has its own little built in special ed helmet. I fucking hate them.\nTldr; Koalas are stupid, leaky, STI riddled sex offenders. But, hey. They look cute.\nIf you ignore the terrifying snake eyes and terrifying feet.",

    "body": "For your reference, from /u/Rystic:\n\n\nIn Beauty and the Beast, Gaston ate four dozen eggs daily when he was a child. That's fourty-eight eggs a day. As an adult he adds another dozen, tallying up to sixty eggs a day. This is nothing short of genocide.\nMy theory for why Gaston is beloved by the townsfolk is that some time prior to the start of the movie, France was overrun with poultry. Helpless at the claws of the chickens, the people of France were preparing to abandon their country, when a lone child stepped forward. \"I'll eat the eggs\", a young Gaston bellowed, \"And I will save our homeland\". And so it was, Gaston ate and ate until he was roughly the size of a barge. How the cholesterol didn't kill him can only be attributed to his inhuman fortitude. This is where the story turns tragic.\nWhat Gaston hadn't accounted for was developing an addiction to the eggs. As he aged, he ate more and more, and with the chicken-crisis over, his addiction began costing him financially. There's a scene during Gaston's song where he motions to a wall full of his hunting trophies. But why are they there? Does he own the bar? No, he sold them for egg money. The fact he never brings up his egg addiction or his prior heroism can be attributed to another one of Gaston's defining character traits: his struggle to be emotionally open, and his modesty. It's not easy being the man who saved France.\n\n\nI think the saddest scene is when Belle shows Gaston the book, and he holds it upside down. See, Gaston seems brutish, but remember - his entire childhood was spent eating eggs. He didn't have time for an education; he sacrificed his upbringing for his countrymen. He can't even hold a book correctly. What Gaston wants to say, what he's struggling to articulate, is \"Belle, I'm dying. A life long diet of a quite frankly insane number of eggs has left my body bloated with tumors. Before I shove off this mortal coil, I want children, who might experience a world without the oppression I have suffered\". Belle cruelly mocks him, which goes to make you wonder who the real beast is.\n\n\nWhen Gaston sees the Beast in the mirror, two thoughts run through his head. First, he sees his countrymen in danger once more, and despite being riddled with egg-tumors, wants to lead the masses to one last charge of glory since fighting for France is all he knows. Second, he realizes Beast's head is about a month's worth of egg-money. So he sieges the castle, and in one of Disney's most tragic moments, plummets to his death.\nAnother reason Gaston wants to marry Belle is because, as mentioned above, all he knows how to do is to fight for France and its people. Gaston saw Maurice as a genuine danger, and he's not wrong; consider the hellish contraption Maurice created. One look at that war machine and Gaston hatched a plan; marry Belle, and get close enough to Maurice to talk him down. Mind you, he did love Belle, and wanted to be the father of her children, but the danger presented by Maurice forced his plan into action immediately. When that fell through, he had no choice but to throw Maurice in the asylum (something marrying Belle would have fixed, since he would once again be close enough to Maurice to influence him). All in all, the failure was one of articulation.\n\n\ntl;dr: Gaston is the protagonist of Beauty and the Beast.",

    "body": "EDIT: top rated and best answer \n\nOk, let's do this.\n\nFirst things first - That million dollars is practically worthless compared to immortality. Ever dime of that cash can and should be spent ensuring that the snail never, ever reaches me.\n\nFirst things first, I keep an eye on him. It's tempting to want to hop on a plane or a train and get as far away as possible. But once I do that, he's gone and I'll never see him again until 3am on July 14th, 2072, when the sneaky little cuss slips in the door and slimes onto me before I ever wake up and notice him No, I'm going to be within visual distance of the snail, slowly moving away from it, until Snail Containment Plan Part A is done.\n\nNext I grab my phone. I call up someone I can trust with my life, and tell them to come to my location within the hour, and to bring a metal cash box, a good padlock, and a firearm. Once they arrive, I inform them of the deal and ask them to grab the snail, shove it into the metal box, and lock it up.\n\nOnce the snail is temporarily secured, I ask my friend to carry around the box, never letting it out of their sight, and to prevent its opening with as much force as is required. We arrive at some reasonable figure for this service - Maybe $50,000.\n\nNow we can start in on the real work. I'm on the phone again, contracting with a tungsten machining service out of Willowbrook, IL. I ask them to construct for me a hollow tungsten sphere with a small, sealable opening, ideally via both exterior bolts and sintering. I ask them for a rush job and a thick wall depth, perhaps as much as a foot thick. The spherical shape should keep material costs as low as possible for a given thickness, but between the unusual object, large amount of tungsten, and speedy delivery, I invest a truly insane amount into this project - Let's say $100,000. I ask them to deliver it to my current location as fast as possible.\n\nOnce the tungsten ball arrives, I have my friend stand well away from me and transfer the snail into the center of the sphere. I ask them to pour a little salt down into the hole after it, just to give the snail a little reminder of who he's dealing with. Once snail and salt are both inside, we seal the hollow sphere with the bolts.\n\nTungsten is an amazing material. Incredibly tough, dense, and heat-resistant. You could drop it into molten lava and it wouldn't matter. Which, coincidentally, is almost what I'd like to do next.\n\nNow we make sure that damn thing stays shut. I find the nearest metal refinery and call them up. I also contract with a heavy machinery moving company to move the tungsten sphere to the refinery. Once the refinery has sintered the tungsten sphere shut, I buy an entire industrial crucible (those big buckets) of molten iron. And the crucible the iron came in. I have them drop the tungsten sphere into the molten iron, and let the whole mass cool in place. Mr. Snaily snail ain't going anywhere, but I'm probably down another $100,000.\n\nNow I'm on the phone to specialist movers. Chartering a boat. We're taking this thing halfway around the word. We take the boat right over the marianas trench - Not the deepest point, but deep enough - We push the whole assembly over the side. Literal tons of once-molten iron, refinery crucible, tungsten, salt, and snail slip over the side and begin dropping into the briny deep. Another $100,000 gone, but well worth the cost.\n\nGood. That's bought me a little breathing room. But we're not anywhere close to done yet. I still have at least $500,000 left. I'm going to invest it into solid business ventures and slow growing but secure assets. We're building a fortune - And who cares if it takes a few centuries? I'm frickin' immortal baby!\n\nBut as I develop my fortune, it's getting invested into space. SpaceX, asteroid mining projects, whatever. I am trapped on the one planet in the entire universe where I can actually die, and I have no intention of staying there.\n\nOver the millennia, I slowly apply my fortune and influence to push mankind to the stars. And the moment living on another planet becomes viable, I'm there. And the instant a habitable planet is around another star? I'm on the first generation ship heading that direction.\n\nBut I can't think in such a short sighted manner now. I'm immortal, and I need to think like it. Eventually, the sun is going to burn the earth to a crisp, and then that damn snail is going to be free. It might take him a few million years to land on something, but he'll do it eventually. And then he will construct a spacecraft and begin crawling towards me again.\n\nWhat I care about now is lightcones and black holes. Earth's gotta go. Sorry whatever's left of humanity. We evacuate anyone still on the old planet, and use a gravity tractor to push Earth into a black hole. A nice, big one so that hawking radiation will take an incredibly long time to evaporate it away into nothing.\n\nAnd then I board a ship. A fast ship. I accelerate to as close to lightspeed as I can get, piloting directly away from the black hole with the snail inside. I want to be so far away and moving so quickly that the heat death of the universe would occur far, far before the snail ever reaches me, even on the fastest ship his freakishly clever little brain can construct.\n\nSo that's the way the universe ends. With nothing it in except for infrared heat, one hyperintelligent snail suspended in an inky void, and one human screaming away from it at .99C.\n\nCheers.",

I went car shopping in the not so distant past, I didn't realize until I was in the car on the way to the dealership that there was a fairly large rip in the Crotch of my jeans. I wasn't wearing underwear, figured I'd just make sure to sit appropriately as my Tshirt fell just below my waste. Anybody that's purchased a car knows how long and boring the process could be and I guess I forgot but sitting across from the car salesmen I looked down and realized I was sitting there with my legs apart and one of my testicles was hanging out from the hole in my pants. I was kinda curious why this guy was keepin such stern eye contact with me but in hindsight I realized it was so he didn't accidentally glance at my balls. I can't beleive the guy didn't say anything but I know from where I was sitti there is was a direct line of sight from my nuts to his vantage point \n\n\n",

Instead of dividing everything at divorce, the law keeps track of which property is owned separately or in community. Community property is owned equally by the spouses, and it's made up of anything acquired during marriage (excluding gifts or inheritances made to only one person). At divorce, spouses keep their separate property and split community property.\n\nOnly 11 states have this system, but it's amazingly just. Totally prevents marriage for the purpose of stealing assets. Of course, there might still be claims of spousal support, but those claims arise more out of the richer party's income than out of their assets (my state also limits spousal support to no more than 1/3 your annual income).

It's one of my replies to him during our conversation:\n\nOh, dude, I know that fear well. I've been blown up, stabbed, and had my ass kicked more than once.\n\nYet no pain I've ever experienced is as bad as getting your heart stomped on. It is indescribable. You would give or do almost anything to make it stop, even just for an hour...\n\nIt seems almost suicidal to allow another fallible, imperfect human being to have that much power over you, especially when you know what could happen.\n\nYou know what, though?\n\nIf the worst happens, you just gut it out and fucking deal. Use it as fuel to make yourself a better man. Then, when the wounds close, you make better judgments and smarter decisions about the next girl - and there will be a Next Girl if this one goes away. There's always another woman out there. Some are worse...but some are better, if you're up for it.\n\nGood luck, man.  I hope that, whatever happens, you make this event a positive one.",

Everyone gets excited, not knowing whats down there. Then some dodgy Russian Gangsters get there first, and rumours start circling about a new super weapon, possibly alien. \n\nMeanwhile the Russians are trying to figure out wtf is up with this snail. It appears to be immortal, totally unharmable and always trying to move in one direction. After a science filled montage, they manage to find a way to communicate. They decide to build a mind controllable robot for the snail, in return for a promise; the secret of immortality. \n\nMr Billionaire meanwhile discovers someone has taken the snail and becomes paranoid, deciding he no longer wants to die. He devotes all his efforts into tracking the snail down, whilst getting a spaceship ready for a one-way trip. \n\nAfter some minor side plot developments, we get to see a showdown of the Robot snail vs the military power of Mr Billionaire. There's lots of michael bay moments, epic scenes, new york gets destroyed, again, but in the end the Billionaire wins, catching the snail in a simple cardboard box.\n\nFinal scene sees the rocket  being prepared, with the snail about to be loaded. The countdown begins, but at the last second the billionaires granddaughter runs out and hugs the snail/box, asking to keep it as a pet. The emotional music starts up, as the Immortal man has a change of heart. The granddaughter keeps the snail as a pet, until one day, many years later her grandpa asks to hold it. After saying something deep and meaningful about life, he closes his eyes for a final time, with the snail resting peacefully on his chest.\n\nRoll credits. ",

She didn't put much effort into her appearance, jeans and t-shirt all the time. She was a bit tom-boyish. She lacked in social graces, this girl was not afraid to be alarming upfront or honest or a bit rude or crass. She was very dry, and wholly unsentimental. To be honest she drove me crazy the first couple of months. \n\nAfter a while though she grew on me because once I was honest with myself I was exactly like her, I just didn't have the courage to be as blunt and honest about who I was. \n\nThen one day we're working and she's twirling her short hair and trying to chew on it unsuccessfully and all of the sudden everything changes. That fucking prism shift of an entirely different perspective. All those \"plain\" features were now natural, and stark. The other girls in our group paled by comparison. All of the sudden this friend I've been working with for a few months is the only thing my mind can focus on. \n\nSadly though there's no happy ending. She was dating someone at the time, but I don't think that would have made a difference anyway. Though our relationship didn't change I think she noticed when I did and didn't want anything to do with it. Like I said she was rather unsentimental. We worked together, went out together, spent 20-40 hours a week together for a year and when we graduated and were saying good bye I saw no hint of attachment, no change of temperament, forget romantic feelings, it was like she didn't have any feelings for me at all, not even as like a \"category 2\" friend. I can't say it didn't hurt but I never blamed her for it. She wasn't cold. She loved people in her life, she just didn't feel that way about me, even a little bit, even in platonic way. And that's who she was, and that's part of what I think I might have fallen in love with. \n\nMaybe it wasn't love, maybe just a hard infatuation, but any other time I've been with a girl it felt forced, like I was always pretending to be someone I wasn't. I watch too many movies, I was like some fake Disney or John Huges version of a boyfriend. I faked it because I didn't know the difference between intimacy and love. With this girl I couldn't help myself though, I didn't even like her to begin with and than one day all of the sudden I think I love her. \n\nI may never find it again but thanks to her I at least know what I'm looking for, someone who I can be my honest, imperfect self with.
