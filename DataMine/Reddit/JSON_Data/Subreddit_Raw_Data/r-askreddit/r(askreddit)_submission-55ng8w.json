So really it doesn't count.\n\nI watch this movie (Along with The Thing) Maybe once every 3 months. It's my favorite.\n\n[Edit] Okay, maybe two, but it shouldn't really count because of the entire mood, setting and atmosphere, the amount of *tension* throughout is just SOOOOOO much more that the jump scares are hardly cheap.\n\n[Edit 2] So I never thought I'd get upvoted like this, so let me add to Why I can watch this once every 3 months or so, as I replied to someone below.:\n\nFor 99% of movies, I would agree with you, but not for Alien. I have been watching it almost non-stop for 20 years, it is just SO well crafted and polished that EVERY time I feel dread, nervousness, anxiety, I am TERRIFIED.\n\nIt's not just about the monster, the monster is a bonus.\nIt's the Atmosphere, the music which is really more of a background set-piece which chills you to the very soul because it is so, well alien. Ever hear Radio signals from space? the music is a lot like that. It makes you uncomfortable in the best ways possible, it isolates your senses.\n\nThe same with the set design, If I remember correctly, they made the decision to have closed roofs, forcing the characters to crouch down and stand bent over, hindering their movements and their sense of freedom - which is entirely conveyed to the audience as well.\n\nEvery single aspect of the movie has been thought out to place the audience in a very fragile spot. The characters even have their own goals and motives, either it's to abide by contract law and just get the long haul done, or getting a bigger pay as you're overworked.\nThe last scene filmed was the first when they were having lunch, as they were all closer together by then.\n\nThe movie is not a thrill ride, like bungee jumping, that would get boring eventually. It's Bungee jumping with a Freyed rope into a dark jagged pit where you don't know the depth, and you will get knicked by the edges to varying degrees, every time.",

    "body": "Honestly I'm going to say 28 Days Later. There are definitely a few jump scares, but they're typically foreshadowed right before. But that movie really scares the shit outta me. The beginning makes you feel so isolated and alone, and then he walks into that church.. That isolated feeling truly doesn't go away, even when they find a few people. \n\nAnd then factor in the actors' reactions. Honestly, they all have sheer terror in their voices. Their screams, facial expressions, etc. On top of all of that, the scenery and sets. The surroundings during the filming is very convincing, as if every thing was just abandoned carelessly in a rush, in a scramble for your life.\n\nAnd to top it all off, the actual ~~zombies~~ infected people^for ^the ^anal ^folk. The Walking Dead is great in its own way, but the zombies just don't do it, they're so lethargic until they're up close. In 28 Days Later, they're terrifying even when you're 300 yards away. Their hissing gurgles, screams, they're insane bursts of speed, and the spewing of blood that when infused with your own, infects you almost immediately and sends you into a blood lusting rage.\n\nEdit: wanted to add a few more things. For one, the sound track and sound effects. It's all so ominous and spine chilling, like listening to it alone could make you feel claustrophobic and in danger.\n\nAnd finally the helplessness certain scenes make you feel. Like his dream when they camp out, when they're changing the tire, when they're sprinting up the stairs of the apartment complex. \n\nScary stuff.\n\n\nEdit: For those who liked 28 Days Later (and Cillian Murphy), check out Sunshine. Like 28 Days Later, it was directed by Danny Boyle. It's about a team of scientists sent to deliver a device that will rejuvenate the sun as it is dying and killing the Earth. It focuses on the 2nd team as the 1st team mysteriously disappeared, but they find the 1st team during the movie. It's so existential and being based in space, it has this eerie, isolated feel that, when combined with the antagonist, is pretty damn chilling. Plus Captain America.",

Also it's the closest thing silent hill fans will get to a good movie in the franchise\n\nEDIT: I'm a huge fan of silent hill. I own all the games (even the bad ones) and have the soundtracks from the first 4. The silent hill movie was pretty awesome and did a near perfect job as far as the set and setting go. That said, I don't think it was a great movie as neither the story or pacing came close to the game in terms of uniqueness and  tragedy. It might be that I'm expecting too much for a series that I love so much, or that I'm just bitter that the second movie didn't follow the second game. There was a silent hill 2 shaped hole in my heart but it's gone now, filled with Jacobs ladder \n\nEDIT 2: Also as someone else said, the first half of the movie was nearly perfect, but sort of dropped off when they got to the church. I think the movie was really benefiting from the feeling of isolation, and suddenly finding so many people changed the pace too quickly. I can see they were going for a sort of cultish isolation, i.e. the main characters are the only ones not in the cult, but it wasn't necessary as they had already set it up so well without them.",

The tagline to the original film is \"who will survive and what will be left of them?\" Even though Sally escapes, you are left asking what will be left of her?

His speaking voice has the precision of a man so arrogant he can barely be bothered to address the sloppy intelligence of the ordinary person. The effect of this scene is so powerful that it underlies all the rest of the movie, lending terror to scenes that do not even involve him.\n\n-- Roger Ebert",

There isn't really an explanation for why the world is the way it is, and it's not even specified whether the world you see is real. When you see what it's about on the surface, that starts to make sense.\n\nIt's about the anxiety and dread of becoming a father.\n\nHenry seems uncomfortable the whole time because he's a shy and timid guy. His girlfriend's family are all kinda creepy to him and they have weird neuroses and ways that he doesn't understand. Mary seems pretty normal since Henry knows her, but he's meeting her family for the first time. The dinner scene is representative of the dread you feel meeting a partner's family for the first time and feeling like a complete alien outsider to them.\n\nThen Mary gets pregnant unexpectedly, and her family insist that he has to marry her immediately, which sends him into a spiral of anxiety. They end up living in his little apartment after the baby is born, but the stress of looking after it is too much for Mary and she abandons it and Henry. Henry is left looking after this strange \"creature\" as he sees it, that he has no idea how to care for. It's not made clear whether the baby actually *is* a weird monster, or Henry just sees it that way. I tend to think it's a normal baby, and its appearance is just a symbol of how helpless Henry feels trying to look after it when he knows nothing about babies. \n\nThe part with the pencil factory is kind of hard to make much of, but I think it's supposed to be showing Henry's desire to just go back to his job where he feels comfortable and secure and escape the terrifying situation he's found himself in.\n\nThe woman in the radiator is a bit bizarre, too, but she does have a purpose. She's essentially his suicidal ideation. Notice how she's stepping on all those little slug things? I think that's supposed to symbolize his wish that Mary had had an abortion. The woman's singing is pretty clear in its meaning. \"In heaven, everything is fine.\" He's clearly thinking that if he kills himself everything will be OK and he won't have to be afraid any more.\n\nIn the end, he's driven crazy by the baby constantly crying, and in an attempt to figure out what's wrong with it (removing its bandages), he kills it. I think it's implied that he didn't intend to kill the baby, he just didn't understand what he needed to do to meet its needs. Then, wracked with guilt, he decides to go be with the woman in the radiator. ie. He kills himself.\n\nEdit: Ta for the gold :) I live to serve",

As Ebert said, even scenes Hopkins isn't in are carried by the force of his performance.  Jody Foster and Ted Levine are superb, but that largely serves to not break the spell.

The defibrulation scene doesn't count, because you're not expecting a jump scare, the jump scare creates the tension, rather than there being tension waiting for the jump scare.\n\nThe petri dish isn't cheap because you have this double level, of who is the alien, and will the test even work. Not just that but the tension is entirely based on plot and character development, not just \"Fuck, something's gonna jump around that corner\"\n\nWhen I first saw the Thing it didn't even feel like a horror movie to me, because it was so well-executed I didn't sense any of the standard horror movie tropes.

I mean, the way its portrayed, he starts behaving like a psycho as a toddler, but aren't all toddlers psycho? The difference is we're seeing him through her eyes, and she sees him as 'out to get her.' Even when that's impossible. The part with him screaming as a baby and she let slip her frustration with the fact that she couldn't connect with him led me to believe it, because instead of seeking help, she blames him for it.  She blames him as an infant for \"tormenting\" her and continues to do so through his childhood and adolescence. It was a self-fulfilling prophecy, in a way. She always felt like he was psychologically torturing her, and he is merely reacting to her expectations. I think this is plausible because we see everything through her eyes, her selfishness and detachment as a young mother, and her guilt and pain after the incident.\n\nBut if he really was an evil baby that's still a pretty great scary story.",

    "body": "A lot of adaptations struggle with how to handle a character's *thoughts*. Changing it to dialogue is one way, narration by the character's voice is another, but it's difficult to do right. \n\nFor example, the Hunger Games book had the chick go through a lot of indecision around Peeta, trying to figure out if she gives a shit about him or if it's all for the camera, slowly building until that one moment where there's a cannon shot and she without thinking says \"Peeta!\" And realizes she does care.\n\nIn the movie you get none of the indecisiveness. She's a bitch to him and then they have a couple bonding scenes and then she loves him. The same scene with the cannon shot and her being all concerned doesn't really mean anything.",

It sneaks up on you, the way he eventually becomes what she thought he was from the beginning, and I can't pinpoint where exactly the shift takes place.\n\nThe part where he breaks his arm makes me think he has some inherent psychopathic tendencies - his unemotional reaction, how quickly he came up with a feasible lie and how effectively he sold it to the doctor and to his father. And then the part when he was a bit older and got sick and actually wanted his mother's company rather than his father's made me think it was primarily a nurture issue. He was uncharacteristically vulnerable, so she softened her attitude toward him, and the result was a normal, healthy mother-child relationship for a very short period of time.
