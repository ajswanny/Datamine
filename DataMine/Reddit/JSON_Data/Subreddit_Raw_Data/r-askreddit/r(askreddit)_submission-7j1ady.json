    "body": "I once had my home Linux server hacked while I was away on winter holiday.   Logging in remotely from my grandparents house I noticed that the server was behaving oddly, took a look at the log files and found them truncated, so sent a shutdown command so I could do forensics when I got home.\n\nWhat I ended up finding really did feel like swallowing the red pill.  Someone had hacked the server using a recent sendmail exploit and resold it to someone who was using it to host an 'eggdrop' IRC bot.   I logged into the IRC channel that it had been holding open and found a bunch of people sending short messages like 'CCs', or 'Root'.\n\nAbout five minutes in a longer message comes along.   Some guy is annoyed with a trade he has made, someone gave him a bad set of data and he wants to make his own data worthless in return before the buyer can get full use of it.\n\nSo on my screen there is suddenly a splat of information about some guy who lives in Texas, credit card, phone number, street address, and the first guy is urging everyone to buy stuff as quickly as possible before the credit limit is hit.\n\nFeeling I was fucked, I disconnected ASAP,  left an anonymous phone message on said Texas individual's answering machine advising them to check their Visa charges,  and hoped that my lack of foresight in not setting up an IP proxy or anything to hide my own identity wouldn't have either the FBI or organized crime breathing down my neck in a few days.",

Yes, the author of the Mists of Avalon and the Darkover series, that Marion Zimmer Bradley. She died 15 years ago, but a few years it came out that she had molested her daughter, and probably other children, all while she had been a celebrated author, feminist, and important figure in the Sci Fi and Fantasy fandoms, from the 60s to the 90s.\n\nYou go down that rabbit hole, and then you find out that MZB's husband, Walter Breen, was a straight up child rapist pedophile who died in jail for it. MZB had defended him and covered up for his pedophilia even before they got married in the 60s. The \"Breendoggle\" scandal ripped apart the liberal hippy Sci Fi fandom in Berkeley; you can still find and read online various [fandoms zines](http://breendoggle.wikia.com/wiki/Breendoggle_Wiki) (newsletters) where this tiny community of a couple hundred nerds were hotly arguing over whether to ostracize Breen from the Sci Fi and Fantasy conventions because of his behaviour towards young boys. You can also find and read [transcripts from a 1990s lawsuit](https://web.archive.org/web/20160907053210/http://www.stephengoldin.com:80/MZB%20Website/Marion%20Zimmer%20Bradley%20%20In%20Her%20Own%20Words.html) against Breen's estate and MZB personally, where MZB comes off as an incredibly disgusting enabler and defender of him, as well as her own crimes against her daughter.\n\nWell, not to recap the whole thing here,  but that rabbit hole is a really horrifying and sickening look at the seedy underbelly of early 60s Sci Fi fandoms. Aside from the bad stuff, though, it's also the gateway to a really interesting look at the history of nerds and fandom, too, though. Link hopping around, you can get into some really fascinating minutiae-- like transcripts of 1960s and even 1940s fandom newsletters, where the early nerds obsessively categorized all the slang terms they used to talk about Flash Gordon or HG Wells. It's not all horrifying child rapists all the way down-- there's a lot of interesting similarities between early nerds and post-internet nerds.\n\n*Edit: to add links.",

My kids were at school, my wife was at work and I was at home just trying to not stop breathing and keep as warm as possible.\n\nI saw an article about some member of the British royal family. Then I said \"Huh, I wonder if any other countries really have active royal families.\" So I started googling and began researching the Norwegian Royals.\n\nThen I found myself on the Wikipedia article for Ari Behn. It said he was a baptized member of *The Christian Community.* Having done quite a bit of reading on the subject of religion I was surprised I had never heard of this group. \n\nThis was a massive rabbit hole. You learn about the Christian Community and that leads you to Rudolph Steiner who leads you to biodynamics, Waldorf education and anthroposophy. \n\nThe bonus was that I felt like I learned a lot about something I was unaware of. The downside was that the next week I went back to work having dedicated myself to the subject full time and didn't know what to do with all of that knowledge or information. ",

    "body": "I was an active Mormon and researching something for a meeting. I came across a website that had great historical information and didn't at first appear to be an \"anti-Mormon\" site.  I read that the Restoration of the Priesthood doesn't have an actual date and immediately I thought that was BS because since I was a child I had read in Church publications all about the Restoration.  I could recite dates, names, places and what these great religious leaders were thinking at the time.  Yeah, about that...\n\nThis website showed strong evidence that it was all a lie, but I was sure they were wrong so I set out to prove they had the wrong facts.  I stared with the Church's publications, but dug deeper.  I searched for source material on college websites.  I found journals and other writings on archive.org.  I found websites that pulled together information from a dozen sources and assembled it in a way that was terrifying to read.  \n\nIn 2-weeks of near constant searching I went from a faithful member to feeling sick, crying and wanting to tear my own eyes out.  Then came anger and that feeling of betrayal.   I spent a couple hours nearly every day for the next year doing my best to prove everything wrong. I prayed, studied, fasted and in the end I had to be spiritually honest -- I had been lied to.\n\nEDIT:  I finally understand the statement \"RIP Inbox\"\n\nI have been responded to dozens of comments - I am doing my best while pretending to work.  :)\n\nEDIT 2:  My marriage ended after we both found out the truth.  After reflection, we were not a good match. In the Mormon faith you don't have sex prior to marriage so you end up with 22 year olds that date, but don't have sex.  This leads to getting married so you can have sex because having sex before marriage keeps you out of the temple - where you are saved.  So, your salvation is based upon getting to the temple.\n\nWithout the fear of losing our eternal salvation and family - the marriage crumbled.",

This has happened with both Cloverfield and 10 Cloverfield Lane and we are expecting it to happen when \"God Particle\" or whatever the third one will be named. /r/Cloververse is the subreddit for it.\n\nHere's one small example. During the trailer for 10 Cloverfield Lane we noticed they were drinking Swamp Pop, which was found as a real company in LA. People later bought 4 packs of it. With the 4 packs people were getting puzzle pieces. In the movie one of the characters is doing a puzzle but was frustrated because couldn't finish it as there were missing pieces.

I'd never done any work like that before, but there were only three residents there and all I really had to do was wipe one of their asses if he got up during the night. Besides having to call an ambulance on my first unsupervised watch (that was not fun), the summer was largely uneventful. There were three male residents. They were all mentally impaired and I got to know all of them both through interactions and through stories from the caretakers. Two of them were in modest health, but the third was wheelchair bound, in his sixties, with some respiratory problems and was pretty much starting on his way out. It was he that really freaked me out. You see, while the other two were mentally handicapped from birth, he'd been in an accident. He'd been driving outside of town when he got into an accident. For the life of me I can't remember whether he forewent his seatbelt or was driving too fast, but I no longer do both after hearing his story. He's in a nasty crash and suffers extensive damage. They manage to save his life, but it takes quite some time for him to gain his motor functions (which he'd lost again by the time I met him), but his mind was pretty much gone. He could talk and interact with you, but only to a certain degree. His memory since the accident was non-existent. He never remembered me. He never remembered his caretaker of (then) twelve years. He never even recognized his daughter which sometimes came to visit him. But he seemed to remember most of his life before the crash. He could tell you all about his car (if you had the patience to listen) and was a hell of an olsen olsen player, but it was as if he'd died in that accident and all that remained was a recording.\n\nNow for the truly horrifying part. When I met him he was in his sixties. He was 22 when the accident happened. His daughter was around 1-2 years old. She never knew her father as anything other than a husk and he has spent longer trapped in that body than he had lived before the accident. His caretaker even confided in me that she thought his health problems were him finally giving up and hoped to God that he would die soon. She loved that man and felt nothing but sadness for the life he'd been forced to live.",

The heat was oppressive but seemed oddly tolerable.  Of course, we made sure we were pounding water and had several gallons to spare in the trunk, and we made sure to follow the recommended safety precautions and didn't spend crazy amounts of time outside, only did some very short hikes (borax mine), and generally appreciated the park from inside of or very close to our rental car.\n\nWhat I did notice though - besides just the fact that 75% of the tourists were European - was that a lot of the foreign tourists didn't seem to take the heat very seriously.  At Badwater Basin - the lowest point in North America - we saw several young children who seemed dazed and their parents only had one small water bottle for the entire group (we each had several bottles in our backpacks).  \n\nWhat stood out the most to me, though, was a foreign family who decided to walk way out into the salt flat from the parking lot.  The mother and young daughter stopped halfway down the flat, but the father and young son kept walking and walking and walking all the way beyond the end of this particular salt flat - and they only had one water bottle.  It was insane.  It was like a five minute walk out there and then they were just standing and milling around for several minutes.  It really made me worried for them.",

I'd read up on numbers stations in the past and was fascinated.  I asked him to explain it,  but it was damn complicated.   Here's the best I can explain it.  \n\nSo agents in the field were told to listen to a radio station at specific times.  If a specific song was played on that radio station it indicated that the agent should tune to the numbers station and the numbers being broadcast would be an authentic message that needed to be decoded,  if a second, different song was being played it signaled that there was no message and any numbers being broadcast were meaningless.  This was so agents in the field wouldn't have to set up their shortwave radio receivers,  and potentially expose themselves to being found with said radios, unless there was an actual message forthcoming.\n\nThe actual numbers themselves were the complicated part... something about five-letter encrypts and \"one-time-use pads\" where the numbers represented groups of five letters,  with some caveats like two \"A\"s meaning \"B\" and some other letters being transposed on the fly (he said a large part of training was committing these to memory). \n\nIt was complex stuff.  I told him that one of these days he should do an AMA on it,  but he isn't sure doing an AMA on cold war espionage would be a great idea in such a public setting.\n\nEDIT: sorry,  he was stationed in brazil at one point,  but when he was doing the numbers stations he was in Florida and Virginia.",

Barbra wants to send secure messages to Alice over shortwave radio once Alice is in some dangerous location.\n\nHere's how it works: First, we make two identical key pads. These pads are just lists of numbers generated by some purely random process, like rolling dice or shuffling cards. Alice takes one to DangerousPlace, while Barb holds on to the copy.\n\nNow, when Barb wants to send a message to Alice, she writes down the message as a series of numbers. The scheme used to turn letters/words into numbers is arbitrary. It could be a 2nd code book, or as simple as just A = 1, B = 2... and so on.\n\nNext, Barb encrypts the message by taking a page from the one time pad, and combining each number in the message with the number from the pad. The specific operation used to combine them needs to be invert-able. This could be modular arithmetic, or the exclusive or operation.\n\nNow Barb has the coded message, and can broadcast it on the numbers station at a pre-arranged time. To decode the message, Alice writes the numbers down, and chooses the same page from her copy of the one time pad. For each pair of numbers she applies the inverse operation, which reveal's Barb's message.\n\nSo long as you *never* reuse a page from the one time pads, this scheme is completely secure, in the information theoretic sense. Even an adversary with infinite computing power couldn't decode it, because they can't recreate the random information on the one time bad.\n\nThe downside of one time pad schemes, is you have to pre share the key data. So you can't use it to set up secure communications with someone new purely via an untrusted communication channel. That requires more tricky schemes.",

    "body": "I had a scary/stupid incident at Joshua Tree. The wife and I went there for a vacation. When we arrived at the airport and got a rental car, they ended up running out of rental cars and we ended up with a jeep. During one of our drives in the park we decided, hey, we've got a jeep, let's do one of these offroad trails. And we found a trail that looked like it ended at a road. \n\nSo we got on this trail and it was mostly sand. Then it got more and more rocky. The thinking was more along the lines of, \"wow, this jeep can handle some rough terrain, let's keep going.\". I don't know how long we went on for, but it seemed like hours. You don't realize that something doesn't look that far, but when going 5mph or less, it takes a long time. Then suddenly we're in a rocky canyon. There is a steep rock slope and I'm not sure if the jeep has the height to clear it. I have the wife watch from outside as I drove over and we made it. We keep going and then another rock slope, even steeper than the last one. And these are to the point where I know that even if I can get down it, I dunno if I could get back up and go back the way we came. And we don't have a winch or anything if we were to get stuck. \n\nWe decide to attempt to go down and keep going, we figured we couldn't be too far from the road and we made it down those rocks. But it just kept getting worse and worse. It was just increasing dread each time we encountered one of these because you know the further you go the harder it will be to get back. And you think the end is coming up around the bend but you have no idea where. You just have this map and guess where you are. What seemed like hours later, we finally made it to the road. \n\nWe had decent water and would have made it through the night if we got stuck or something. But who knows how long it would have been before someone came by or saw us. There was no way we were walking out of there. A fun trip quickly escalated into a scary scenario where we just wanted to get the heck out of there. Lesson learned.",

Usually it's just an incarnation of the Dominant/submissive dynamic, and is kept to consenting adults in safe situations, and a lot of it focuses on care giving and comfort.\n \nHowever, from what I've seen, these \"Bad Baby\" videos are a type of \"scene\" created by people and posted on YouTube. I'm not sure if they're actual consenting adults who enjoy infantilism or how willing all of the participants are. In BDSM circles, consent (even in \"nonconsent\" roleplay) is paramount - so posting these videos where non-consenting people (CHILDREN especially) could view them unwittingly goes against everything I've ever known about the community. I've heard of videos featuring people/children vomiting, urinating/defecating, being \"punished\" in various methods for being a \"bad baby,\" etc. \n\nOne of the more well-known contributors that sort of broke the elsagate thing (and got his channel banned because it went viral) was a father making videos with his two school-age daughters. His stuff often featured infantilism, or a scene where he comes into the bathroom while his daughters are taking a bath (in bathing suits) and scaring them with fake spiders/snakes and a live frog once (?) until they're screaming/crying. Another showed the youngest being force fed baby food until she threw up. One showed one of the daughters \"wetting\" herself, but no one knows if it was real or faked for the purposes of the video.",

We were in contact with one of the e-mail addresses on there 8 (EDIT: actually probably around 10/11) years ago, and they made us do some weird puzzles + riddles before finally giving us our own domain in Hacker's Canyon where we could essentially post what we want. It was around this point our investigation fizzled out, however 6 years later I e-mailed one of the addresses on the site again explaining who I was and that I was interested in picking up where I left off with the website, and they responded quickly, offering me the information needed to take control of the domain again. \n\nCombine this with the strange subject matter, the pages about drug smuggling, gangs, videos of snipers from the Iraq war, and it starts getting really fucking weird.

    "body": "I hear that man, I was raised in a very fundamentalist Christian upbringing. Literally everyone I knew until I graduated were Christians. When I left the church I lost all of my friends and every bit of support I had once counted upon, not to mention all my childhood dreams of being a youth minister or teaching sunday school. I had been obsessive about learning all the stories, we went to church 3 times a week because I loved it, and then I was discovering that all my instincts for things I enjoy are actually empty promises or built upon a literal translation of an apocryphal tale.\n\nI still miss going to sing at church (acappella), even if I didn't believe the words in the final year. And I still miss my old church family and the warmth and fellowship they provided, but the couple times I attempted to visit I just felt like a heretic and the judgmental pity in the eyes of my former close friends and mentors was just too much. I know that was just my internal obsession over the scriptures and quotes from \"The Prodigal Son\" ringing through my mind. But the worst thing is not trusting my conscience anymore, since it still hates me for \"sinning\" or it guilts and shames me about the most trivial or random events, even when I tell it that I don't believe that type of thinking anymore, it still makes me feel rotten. It is not nearly as bad now, like with Love even the bad pain fades and it just gets more gray. I just wish I had more friends, I really miss being able to just show up somewhere and visit with lifelong friends and their families; I really feel like I got an amputation and I don't know how to use that part of my heart anymore. \n\nOverall being raised like that helped me to be more kind and selfless, but I'm unsure how much that also made me act small and meek, when it would have been better to be assertive.\n\nedit - I guess another benefit is that sometimes when I'm bored I've been known to say to a co-worker \"hey have you heard about the story of Samson and Delilah? and proceed to tell the entire story. Crazy how much stuff sticks with you over the years. Would be nice if I had a real use for all these gospel tunes and stories about badasses like Ehud the left-handed assassin (a judge).",
