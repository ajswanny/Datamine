The first time i had that full body orgasm that leaves your eyes rolled back in your head and speaking in tongues. The first time i squirted. The first time i begged to 'stop' and 'dont stop' like some kind of bi-polar sex fiend. And the first time I said 'I love you' because of orgasms.\n\nSo... yeah... that is dark magic. \n\nIf its not you thing thats ok, but the ass is the window of the soul to some people.\n\nEdit: wew. So to everyone asking me where you can learn this power: [NSFW!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HT0OFF4x5HE).\n\nI'd suggest definitely not springing it on your s/o before you get a muddy pie =\\\n\nJust jump them after they've had a shower, though i hear men of culture dont mind. \n\nAlso his hands weren't empty, one was doing thank spank/grope thing on my cheeks and the other with in my v. Booty eating is the icing on an already delicious cake. \n\nTo every man/woman/robot out there about to broaden their diet I wish you bon appetite! Results may vary but I hope your s/o are all blessed with many orgasms in 2018.\n\n[Gilded twice?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD_ag67tH3I)\n",

I actually prefer eating ass to eating pussy. The thing I like most about eating ass it that it\u2019s so consistent. Assuming solid hygiene, every ass I\u2019ve eaten has a certain taste and smell that I love. Meanwhile, pussy is always a gamble. Regardless of the timing of the most recent shower, all the pussies I\u2019ve eaten taste and smell different. Sometimes that\u2019s good, other times it\u2019s not. I just like the consistency of eating ass. Also, it\u2019s one of those things where someone is giving everything over to another person. If you let someone lick your butthole, that\u2019s the most intimate thing you can do. To be able to just let go of your insecurities and feelings of being self conscious to let someone bury his/her face in your ass is something else. Plus, it used to be taboo, so that adds some fun. Lastly, my girlfriend loves it and instructs me to eat her ass from time to time and I\u2019m always happy to oblige.\n\nI\u2019ve talked at length about eating buttholes in my personal and professional life and I am now known at work as the guy who loves buttholes and eating ass among my coworkers.

Once she found out what I did, she wont let me do it  anymore.\n\n\nEdit 1: Im gonna do it tonight boys, Im gonna eat ass for the first time. We talked about and she is open to trying it.  I will post the aftermath in an edit. \n\nEdit 2: When we talked about it she said she is open to it but I didn't tell her I planned on doing it last night.  Anyway we were chilling in bed and she was working on some school stuff (she always showers before we go to bed so I was in the clear in that regard). I started to fool around and eventually went down on her, a couple of minutes into it I flip her over and eventually do the deed. She kinda jumped at first because she wasnt expecting it but relaxed almost immediatly, she loved it. I enjoyed it too, a lot more than I expected to, and well she enjoyed it much more than that.  She finished pretty quickly after that and she isnt opposed to it anymore so, yeah this thread just made my sex life better.",

    "body": "So years and years ago, I was dating this guy who worked as a livestock Handler in rural Alberta. Really grizzled too, and sort of the person who you'd expect to be one part Cowboy, one part Eskimo. It worked for me at the time.\n\nAnyway, he always work with llamas, and said they were ornery sons of bitches, never really respecting anything you wanted, and just generally shiting on you. Except for one Lama, Steve, he loves Steve. He swore Steve was better than the other llamas, because Steve Wouodnt bite or kick him. One day, I visited him at work, and he was showing me around and pointed excitedly and said 'that's Steve'. Something about him seemed off, so I approached the llame (slowly). I learned, through stories and observing scars, that you never approach those animals too fast. Any way, Turns out Steve wasn't a  llama he was an alpaca. Me and the handler broke up later that year. Don't miss him all that much, but miss his dog for sure ",

    "body": "I have recently made a mistake in my life, and I offer my story to you, that you may learn from my error. It all started, as many things do, with me having trouble shitting.\n\nNo, I was not constipated; this was not a regularity problem but a matter of technique. It seems my ass-hair had grown to such a length that tiny grogans were constantly getting tied up in the matted jungle between my asscheeks. It led to much frustration, with me KNOWING that I still had something to drop, but unable to shake the tenacious turd lose from its butthair dwelling. Eventually I would have to do two things: either reach down with some paper and try to pinch off the lingering loaf (which required careful precision to avoid smearing the creature all over my rear, especially since I had no way of seeing what I was doing) or just go for broke, start wiping, and hope that I could remove all the leftover fecal matter before the toilet paper reached its Can?t-Be-Flushed threshold.\n\nI was contemplating this problem, when I had what seemed at the time to be a bright idea. ?Hey! This is my butt and my butt-hair, right? So why don?t I just eliminate all the hair, and then my grogans will flow out like beer from a keg!? I said to myself. It is a statement that will go down in history with a lot of other regretted statements. ?How many Indians could there be?? said by General Custer. ?Looks like a good day for a drive!? by JFK. ?There! America On-Line now has complete Usenet access!? by some idiot system tech. Such was my anal shaving idea.\n\nI performed the operation that night, with a cheap disposable razor and a towel to sit on. Starting from the bottom, and shaving from the crack to the cheeks, I began the arduous process of ridding my ass of hair. Occassionally, I would have to clean the razor of accumulated hair and miscellaneous slime, which I did by wiping it on the towel. Slowly, my twin mounds and the between-ravine began to resemble the hairless cheeks of a newborn baby. Finally, I wiped the razor one last time, and surveyed my work. The towel was covered with a pile of hair. My ass was smooth as ivory. I smiled, satisfied, thinking my troubles were over.\n\nLittle did I know.\n\nI now have a great respect for anal-hair. Like everything in this world God created, it has its mighty purpose in existence. It was only after I had removed it that I started to learn how much I had been taking it for granted. For one, it provides friction. I learned this the next day, when I walked out into the sun heading for class. After climbing two flights of stairs and starting to sweat, I started to notice something unpleasant. The sweat was accumulating in my crack, and was causing the unpleasant sensation of my two asscheeks sliding past each other with every step. I thought about going to the bathroom and wiping it off, but had to get to class. Eventually, I thought, it would dry.\n\nUnfortunately, it did dry, but only after mingling with the microscopic $!@%- molecules lingering around my brown starfish. When I stood up after class, my cheeks were stuck together with a slimy sticky $!@%/sweat combination. As I made my way back to my dorm, it started to itch. God-DAMN, did it itch! Felt like a swarm of ants was making its way up and down my crack. Fighting to keep from jamming my hand down there and scratching away, I rushed back to the dorm.\n\nUnfortunately again, this exertion caused me to sweat, and when I finally reached my room, my cheeks were sliding back and forth against each other like a pair of horny cane-toads. I quickly dropped my pants, and attempted to dry my ass off by sticking it in front of a fan and spreading my cheeks. As I pulled the two mounds of flesh apart, a horrible stench burst free and filled the room. Every dog within a 4 block radius started to howl. I had it worst of all, as the ripe aroma of festering shit/sweat went into the fan and blew back into my face. I fought to keep from heaving. And as I sat there, fighting smile, my ass cheeks spread and dripping, with the concentrated aroma of my body odor mixed with the tangy smell of my own shit blowing right into my face, I had only one thought: ?It will be like this until the hair grows back. Weeks.?\n\nLater on, trying to deal as best I could, wiping my ass at every opportunity, I discovered another wonderful use for ass-hair - ventilation. I attempted to launch a fart, only to have it get stuck between my asscheeks. Apparently, with no hair, the two pink twins can get vacuum sealed together, and the result was a frustrating fart that slid up and down between my cheeks like a lost gerbil.\n\nAs if that wasnt enough, I am now enduring further torture. As anyone who has ever shaved anything knows, when hair is first growing in, it comes in as stubble. Imagine your ass having the texture of a brillo pad. Well, that is what I am dealing with now. It is a hellish torture, and there are many times when I just look out the window and contemplate why I shouldn?t just jump out and get it all over with in one fleshy splat, rather than endure this constant agony.\n\nFriends, DONT SHAVE YOUR ASS-HAIR!\n\n\n\n\n",

If swamp ass is still a problem a little bit of baby powder or more lotion helps. \n\nYou will get some ingrown hairs from time to time just like shaving elsewhere. They suck. But if you stay on top of shaving it once a week you'll never look back. No more wiping with half a roll of toilet paper. The feeling of your cheeks sliding against each other when they're smooth actually feels kinda nice. The stuck farts thing actually happens. Its still kinda funny.
