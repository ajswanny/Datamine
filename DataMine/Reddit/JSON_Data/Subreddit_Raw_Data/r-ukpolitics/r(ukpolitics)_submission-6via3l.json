It is also completely fine to do so if they fail to show up at that station. This is common practice for all but the most clueless train users or - dare I say - people *who don't tend to use trains much*.\n\nCorbyn did neither and the footage proves it.

Corbyn very arguably deserves an apology if this is true, though I see people also suggesting he *still* walked by empty seats and *still* opted for his semi-staged photo op, so he might not be *completely* innocent. I'm sure more details will emerge.\n\nPotential politically-motivated manipulation of evidence aside, I didn't support nationalised railways before 'traingate', didn't after it, and still don't now. \n\nNationalising things isn't a magic wand. In fact if the 70s are anything to go by, nationalised industries eventually become deeply unprofitable, deeply inefficient, and remain propped up by militantly unionised state employees who don't care that propping these things up is breaking the back of the economy. What would be different this time, beyond the railway network also being subject to the same austerity every other government service is subjected to?\n\nI'd prefer they revise the service level agreements the franchise operators are held to and allow them to scale down timetables or discontinue completely the routes that are the most unprofitable, and pass the savings on to ticket prices.

He sat on the floor in the little room between the doors and the seating area. Overcrowding on the trains is a legitimate issue, and he posted a picture of himself sitting on the floor, calling attention to it. \n\nGuy who owns a train company (so politically opposed to Corbyn on this issue) released an image showing that there were lots of empty seats, suggesting that Corbyn was making stuff up to peddle an untrue narrative.\n\nThis video (though I've not seen all of it) suggests that the still image showing all the seats is actually misleading. While a single shot from a fixed point of view shows no heads peeking over the top of the headrests, watching over a short period of time reveals lots of tiny glimpses of hands, arms, hair etc. that suggests that most or all of the seats WERE actually occupied - that it was just the low camera angle that made them hard to see. \n\nI think there's also other footage of people sitting on other bits of floor, suggesting that they couldn't find seats either - suggesting Corbyn was actually correct.\n\nSo assuming there's no digital mucking around going on, it appears as though a rich train owner misled the public (intentionally or not, you decide) to try and discredit a story that made his trains look bad, a story delivered by one of his political opponents.

I'm not defending how rail is operated in this country at all, but the fact that we have the oldest railways in the world works very much against us. The platforms aren't long enough for longer trains, the bridges aren't high enough for double decked trains, and nothing was built with modernisation like in-cab signalling in mind. Add 200 years of building cities around our railways into the mix and it's very, very difficult and expensive to modernise. The main difference is, other countries like France and Japan have built totally separate modern railways for their high speed rail programmes. ",

There ends up being dozens of empty unused seats because people see the ticket and think it can't be used at all.\n\nThere have been times I've gotten on that train and had to stand for 3+ hours or sit on my bags for the same amount of time, so Corbs highlighting what hundreds of people go through every day was great. The CCTV shows a time when it isn't even *that* full compared to how it can be. I can remember times where it's been so packed that you literally can't move for the first leg of the journey, like being on the tube during rush hour. That's how bad it gets.\n\nStill, as good as ol' Corbs can be, his team definitely got him to make the most out of that situation.",

Despite the much higher concentrations in the personal air samples of car drivers, the uptake of CO, benzene, toluene and xylenes of cyclists sometimes approached that of the car drivers. The uptake of NO2 of cyclists was clearly higher than that of car drivers.\n\nIt may be explained by not accounting for respiration rates:\n\n> There is, of course, another big factor at play: Barrett\u2019s study measures exposure, not dosage, and a cyclist is likely to breathe more heavily, which could increase the amount of black carbon ingested.\n\nAnyway, regardless of who is poisoned the most (although I concede it's not black and white like I originally assumed and that drivers do appear to be breathing in the same or more levels - shocking considering filtering etc) we would all benefit from less vehicles on the road, which can only be achieved by encouraging cycling and public transport.

    "body": "It's a question of what constrains the system. Imagine you had the most simple rail line possible: just two ribbons of steel, with no electronics and basic signaling. You'd be able to send about one train down the track each way in an hour. You have obvious constraints: with two tracks you could double the capacity, with better signaling/electronics you could send trains closer together, etc.\n\nOnce you're handling tens of thousands of passengers each hour the constraints are less obvious, and depend on the system in question. Let's say you take an old tube line that needs upgrading to handle more passengers. You could introduce new trains that carry more people. You could improve the electronic signalling to run them closer together. But now you're running into other problems: what about the stairs and elevators in the stations? You can't move more people if more people can't get in and out of the stations themselves. What about the size and layout of the platforms? If people are bumping into each other on the platform, it takes more time to load/unload the trains and causing delays, and then you're running fewer trains per hour even if you're intending to run more. What about maintenance and repair staff? If you're trying to run more trains, you'll need more skilled technicians and larger maintenance depots. \n\nSo it may seem like bigger trains will carry more people, but it's not as simple as that. First of all, single-level trains don't carry all that many fewer people than double-level trains. Many people can stand where one person can sit, and with double-level trains you have to put in stairs at both ends where its unsafe to be when the train is in operation. Having two levels increases the *floor* size (which means more spaces for seats), but doesn't markedly increase the standing room (as the second level is usually to short to stand comfortably in, and the upper edges curve in). But there's a bigger problem.\n\nSpecifically the issue is loading/unloading. Let's say you want to run as many trains per hour as possible. You essentially need your trains to run with little or no delay, or else you'll cause them to bunch up, which has a cascading effect on the trains behind them. So how do you bring those loading times down to a minimum? Basically: lots of doors. And wide doors. [For example, look at this train in Hong Kong.](http://www.ims.cuhk.edu.hk/visit/mtr.png) It's got five doors for every 20 m car, meaning if you want to get off/get on you're never farther than a metre to a door.\n\nOn a double-level train you have fewer doors. You've got to put stairs in, which means less space for doors. It also means that if you're on the top level, it's harder for you to get off (and people to get on). This might seem like a small issue, but if you're running 30+ trains per hour even adding five seconds of wait time each stop will destroy your schedule. So if you're really pushing a system to its limits, you want to run single-level trains. ",

So you gain in capacity, but not as much as you might think. \n\n>I know this because I've lived in Germany and they have double-level trains, which also don't have fewer doors than normal, and for which I don't feel (I admit my feeling isn't a good argument) unloading/loading takes much longer than it would otherwise.\n\nGermany only uses double-level trains for regional intercity services, not for s-bahn or u-bahn networks. Regional trains depart less frequently and share the tracks with other services, so having fewer trains each with more capacity makes sense (and where passengers are travelling longer and strongly prefer to sit). For denser transit lines only single-level trains are used. In France and Switzerland some cities use double-level trains for these services (like the RER in Paris or S-bahn in Zurich) but they're actually phasing them out in favour of single-level trains. \n\nRemember when you're trying to run as many trains as possible every second counts.",
