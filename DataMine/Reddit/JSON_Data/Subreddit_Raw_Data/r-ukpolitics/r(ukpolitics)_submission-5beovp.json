Because the owners are against it, there is simply no debate allowed to be had. It would be one thing if there was a discussion about them and we decided not to, but the fact that Rothermere et al are able to suppress the discussion from even happening at all demonstrates the dangerous and pernicious influence they wield. So it's a bit rich for them to publish stories complaining about undemocratic judges - judges are appointed to uphold the law, but these people have simply bought influence over the political system, which is very dangerous",

    "body": "What we need is a system of public commissioning.\n\nLet's said aside say, \u00a380 million.  This is enough to pay the equivalent of 3,000 journalists a basic annual salary of \u00a324,000 a year.\nIn this system, wales, Scotland, northern Ireland and each English region would have a statutory body that holds these funds.\nThis makes it possible for each region to support around 250 *full time* investigative journalists (there are currently between 75-100 full time investigative journalists, all of them Dependant on their income from the state or private institutions.)\n\n\nIn this system of public commissioning citizens would, collectively and equally, make decisions about the allocation of resources to journalists and researchers. Each of us would be able to provide a certain amount of materia support for project that we want to see funded according to an agreed formula. This formula would include a minimum number of votes to support a given amount of funding, and votes could be split to support a number of projects according to an expressed set of priorities.\n\nJournalists, academics and citizen researchers would post proposals for funding. These proposals would be made online and elsewhere. Applicants would outline the purposes of the inquiry, the time frame and the resources needed. The public would then vote for the proposals it wanted to support, these may range for the hyper-local to the transnational in scope.\n\nEach round of voting would be preceded by a series of public meeting, in a time and place that assures everyone can participate (access for the disabled, suitable time so both young and old people can attend) \nEveryone has a say in this system.\nThose asking for funds would have to make the case for the investigations they want to conduct, asking questions from the community etc.\n\nMeetings would also be held after the fact to discuss the content of reports once they are complete etc, these results could also be made available to the BBC if the community deems it necessary. \n\nThe public now has control over information, not one or two editors.\nThis is also different from 'public journalism', as they still have to answer to the state. In this system, journalists answer directly to the public.\n\n\nIs this open to mischief? Yes. But how can it be any worse than what we already have? Also, I highly doubt the community will vote to spend money on tabloid journalism which they can get anywhere else, and which the media currently supplies very efficiently  (would they vote to spend resources on finding out what Paul Gascoigne's doing, or how their local council spends funds?)\n\nOnce this is in in place, every institution becomes the object of unblinking scrutiny. Even if we are as cynical as the most morally degraded tabloid editor, the existing protections from libel and privacy remain in place.\n\nOne this principle is established, who knows what could happen? \n\nOne things for sure, the current media is not supplying information effeiciantly.",

And what about non-clear cut issues where there isn't an objective truth, but one side of the argument believes there is?\n\nFor example, the transgender debate. I am not convinced that men can become women and vice versa, but those who believe the opposite see their view as objective truth. For proof of this look no further than the show about the transgender girl scheduled to be aired on CBBC. There's nothing wrong with the impartial BBC making this and showing it to children in their minds, as it's just telling the truth.\n\nObjective truth isn't really a thing in the media, and to regulate to force the press to be honest is to invite fascism.",

Are people factoring in that people might be saying certain things in order to make a good impression amongst their peer group/acquaintance list? \n\nThey're the ones with all the power now, Murdoch's power is waning and he knows it. If you follow his Twitter you'll see he was complaining about Google putting their people into downing street, and sarcastically complimented them on the \"most brilliant lobbying campaign yet\". A few years back he was also complaining about Google taking a lot of the ad revenue from his online content. The way he sees it, he spends the money whilst Google pocket it. \n\nhttps://twitter.com/rupertmurdoch/status/158321072943542272?lang=en\n\nhttps://twitter.com/rupertmurdoch/status/692380508907507712  \n\nIMO this goes some way to explain why he supported Leave. He was pissed off with Cameron, pissed off with his declining power and influence. He wanted to put the cat amongst the pigeons. ",

Obviously that would be up to a court, just like our libel laws which have a far lower threshold. \n\nOutside of that objectivity, holding people to account for sedition against the judiciary doesn't have to mean criminal sanctions. These papers should be pilloried for their actions. They should be the object of national shaming by politicians and people for their revolting hatred. That doesn't mean they have to be prosecuted. \n\nI was always strongly in favour of that idea someone had where crowdfunding would be used to hire paparazzi to hound Paul Dacre and Rupert Murdoch and make their lives a misery, posting private photos of their lives all over the internet. That sort of response - legal but aggressive, using their own despicable methods against them - seems the most apt. \n\nThese are the most deeply unpatriotic, disturbing, insidious people in Britain.

This spoof headline, however, condemns the individuals involved in producing a free press within this country - quite selectively chosen as anyone if a right-leaning or pro-Brexit disposition - and then attempt to label them all \"fascist\" or otherwise associated with \"fascism\", for what action, exactly? For reporting on the activity in a negative way, and reporting on Brexit positively.\n\nThere is quite a distinct difference between highlighting judges or jurors who attempt to overthrow a clear-cut and expensive nationwide referendum decision, seemingly acting in a partisan way to subvert the will of the people; and highlighting members of the free press that publish stories you don't like. The reason I am no longer a member of the party in your tagline is precisely that reason - it does not actually support its own principles of liberal democracy when it goes against the policies that they would like to see.",

People like myself are angry at well to do people such as entertainment stars using their considerable public influence to attempt to divert much needed and limited resources away from the poor and needy citizens of this country. \n\nI think an American Redditor said it best about a similar situation in his own country. 'These stars who claim they are moving away due to disgust at their own country, it's always moving to Canada never Mexico'. It is easy to enjoy the glory of feeling like they are doing something good when they don't feel the consequences of their actions. Uncontrolled immigration disproportionately affects the lower classes and if you can't empathise with that and understand it then people will get angry at your continued attempts to make it worse. ",

There were scare-tactics on both sides, but not the outright lies Leave used. Look at the latest stats now; enough people regret their decision to vote Brexit that the vote would be in favour of remaining if it was retaken now.
