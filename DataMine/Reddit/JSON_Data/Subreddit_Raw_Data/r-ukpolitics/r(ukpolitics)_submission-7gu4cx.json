    "body": "Can we stop describing voting reform as \"PR\"?\n\nPR refers to a specific set of electoral systems that give levels of \"victory\" to individual parties in proportion to the votes provided.  For example, the simplest form (closed-list PR) involves voters picking their favourite out of a list of parties, and those parties then are given a number of slots to fill with their chosen MPs.  They can get more complicated, usually by making the MP selection process more democratic.\n\nPR produces multiple candidates.  This is obvious - one \"winner\" cannot be chosen proportional to all the voters' choices, unless the voters all vote the same way.  In the UK, we have ingrained constituencies into our political system, which are inherently antithetical to a proportional system - a constituency generally has a single representative (or a small number of representatives in some cases).  There are some ways of trying to marry proportionality with constituencies, these generally consist of variations on MMPR, where voters choose both a constituency representative *and* a national party, and the winning constituency representative is guaranteed a seat, with the rest of the national seats being doled out proportionally.\n\nTrying to implement a proportional parliament, however, is *one* form of voting reform amongst many.  Other electoral systems tend to focus on different ways of electing a constituency representative.  Because only a limited number of representatives will be chosen, these systems need to work really hard to choose a candidate that is widely accepted in the group they have been chosen to represent.\n\nGenerally, the big thing to reform here is offering the ability to express a more complex opinion than simply picking a favourite.  Among the options are ranked voting systems (like AV and STV), score voting (where you rate each candidate), approval voting (score, but where the scores are 0 or 1), or more complicated things that tend to get harder to calculate.  The important thing to understand is that these *are not trying to be proportional*.  They are trying to elect the *best possible local representative*.  Now in practice, as smaller candidates are usually the worst off under FPTP, any voting system more complex than \"winner takes all\" will probably give the smaller parties more seats, thus making national governments more proportional.  This is generally a good thing, and quite desirable, but it's just one of many effects of picking a local candidate who is more popular in their constituency.\n\nSTV also deserves its own special mention - it is technically proportional, but only in stages, and only at the constituency level.  The count starts by totting up all the '1's for each candidate.  If any candidate gets more than a certain value (say, a quarter of the number of voters), then they get reduced down to that maximum number, and the people who voted for them are divided *proportionally* between the rest of the candidates according to their second votes.  This repeats, with people also dropping out under certain conditions are met, until there remains a group of candidates.  These are *all* elected.  The magic of proportionality is in the redivision of votes, not in the eventual elected government.  STV, while partially proportional, should still be thought of as a constituency voting system.\n\nThis doesn't mean that you should dismiss STV, AV, and other constituency systems.  I'd argue that, for Britain, fixing how we elect our constituency representatives is far *far* more important than fixing our overall Parliament.  I'd also argue that simple closed-list PR is essentially the FPTP of the PR world - the simplest and least useful option.  I think all of us have opinions on how Parliament should be made up that are more complex than a simple 'favourite' preference.  I recognise, however, that many people disagree with this.  I would point to MMPR as a compromise option, although, having seen it in practice, I've become very disillusioned by it.\n\nThe main thing is that we should be critical about our voting systems, and not just blindly accept the myth of 'PR above all', or describe voting systems that have nothing to do with PR as being 'more PR' or 'PR lite'.  AV is not PR.  It is also not all that great, but that's for its own reasons, not because it has anything to do with PR.\n\nIf you want to read more into this stuff, I'd recommend looking at the [Electoral Reform Society's](https://www.electoral-reform.org.uk/voting-systems/types-of-voting-system/) list of voting systems, which provide summaries and interactive demos that help explain some of the ideas.  I don't quite agree with their rankings, but tbh this is subjective enough that I don't think that'll ever happen.  For looking at different ways to elect a single person (specifically designed for the Presidential election, but also relevant to any constituency-based system), a bloke called Nicky Case made [this interactive demo](http://ncase.me/ballot/) of different options, and how they interact.",

Also he got ridiculed pretty badly for his apology video which, while probably sincere, was unlikely to change people's views.\n\n'if they left the tories to rot' - then the tories would have won outright at the next election...which they did. The tories did a great job taking most of the credit (especially for things that weren't primarily their idea) and the Lib Dems took the flack. I'm sorely disappointed how naive they came across with how they dealt with their coalition partners - just because they were the smaller party didn't mean they had to be cowed into submission (at least in the public eye).\n\n'the Lib Dems could have won the next election' - I'd love to be that optimistic, but it's falling on deaf ears with the public who feel they've had a go with the Lib Dems but better the devil(s) they know.",

They don't actually represent anyone that votes for them outside of making sure they maintain incumbent advantage. \n\nVotes are merely a hope that you're tipping the scales somewhere in your general ideological direction on some decision somewhere down the line in DC. \n\nThe system sucks giant donkey balls. Technology exists to actually have a pretty good democracy with a lot of citizens voting on issues, but I don't think that's necessarily great, either. I'm looking at last week's frontpage net neutrality takeover and the continuation where there isn't even a dialogue for the other side's view allowed. If you can honestly be considered well-informed and not just allowing others to shape your opinions, you've probably spent more time studying law than most people who practice it. \n\nSo, it falls back to a democratic republic. Which should work, in theory, but we can't actually elect people that represent us, because only two distinct and diametrically-opposed political ideologies get a say... \n\nI stopped voting a while ago. I've never seen a politician I want to support. I take a nap with my dog during the long lunch period I get for voting.",
