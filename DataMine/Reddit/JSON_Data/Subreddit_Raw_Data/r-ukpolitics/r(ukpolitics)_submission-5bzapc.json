Some rich people screwed the world economy but got to stay rich because the government took money out of the pockets of the average taxpayer to keep them in their ivory tower.\n\nSince then, the world seems to have taken a lurch to the right. People are more motivated by making sure they're alright, Jack - than being interested in a more egalitarian mindset. I can't say I blame them - the greedy got richer, the poor got fucked and it keeps getting worse for them. The only way to survive is to make sure that there are plenty of people underneath you in the scrum.\n\nEvery vote since then has been part self-interest and part \"fuck you\" to the \"establishment\". Clinton was about as establishment as it's possible to be. Very few people thought she would actually operate in their best interests unless they were already people of influence.\n\nSo we're about to hit 4 years of complete turmoil. The ripples will hit the world, of course, but I truly pity anyone in America who isn't financially secure. It's going to be messy for them.",

There is clearly rising nationalistic reactionary populism across Europe, just like in the 1930's, except this time America is also deeply affected. These movements are led by charismatic demagogues who foster hatred and division for their own ends, ends which ultimately always turn out to be power and wealth, just like in the 1930's. There is also a backlash in the form of radical, often populist, left wing movements, especially in Southern Europe, just like in the 1930's. There is a greater degree of radicalisation on both both sides of the political spectrum not seen since the 1930's. \n\nAll of this flies in the face of the six decades of liberal democratic consensus we have had, leaving moderates and centrists perplexed and unwilling to admit the existence or the cause of the problem. People are scared, they are terrified of globalisation and they are angry at the slow pace, or total lack of economic development since the 2008 recession; they hear these demagogues offer easy solutions, blaming the problems on the other, and they lap it up because they are angry, tired and frustrated by the inability of mainstream politicians to address these problems. However, people have also forgotten what nationalism, racism and fascism lead to; they have forgotten that only 70 years ago, nationalism, racism and fascism led to the systematic killing of millions upon millions of innocent people. Hopefully, with a more sophisticated political system than in the 1930's we can avoid genocide, but you never know.",

In the UK, the media beat up the EU at every turn for decades. Yet now a Tory was asking them to vote to stay in. The outcome should have been visible. A backlash was a very real posibility.\n\nLikewise, in the US there has been decades of the alt-right creating an echo chamber creating huge mistrust in politics. It was only a matter of time until someone was able to mobilise them. Trump harnessed this power to become president.\n\nWe _all_ need to get out of our echo chambers and really understand our fellow citizens better. Through this dialogue we might come to understand each other better and form better policy as a result.",

It's become too easy for people to have their opinions laid out for them on the perception of said opinions being \"right\" or \"left\", and these lazy habits are reinforced through social echo chambers.\n\nWith information more readily available to people than ever before, we are seeing a drive towards a politics of disinformation, where people's prejudices are being manipulated to bring about certain political outcomes.

People from across the spectrum have been calling the US system broken for years and infact the left have probably been more vocal on this issue. Bernie Sanders is one of the most leftwing candidates in the US and he built his campaign on the same dissatisfaction that Trump did.\n\nOne of the reasons Clinton struggled so much was that she was an establishment candidate trying to sell the status quo to democrats who for years had been calling for change.

Many of the left wing have tried to change the definition of racism so that only whites are the bad guys. \n\nAs someone who falls left of most on the spectrum, I am insulted that the left is now associated with those kind of people. I would like to make a movement to call these people the wet left. Those who truly represent the left believe all are equal, and that all have the right to offend, but no one has the right not to be offended. Hateful rhetoric to incite violence is that only limit. Political correctness is good to an extent, but when it goes too far it just stifles discourse and makes people scared to say anything at all for fear of being labelled as a [whatever]ist. As you say, it's no wonder we are now seeing a surge in the outspoken right, they've been keeping quiet until someone who spoke their language came on to the world stage. Someone who was able to say pretty much whatever he wanted, and no matter how vile some of the things he said were, he managed to rise above it; why not vote for him. \n\nNow we're living in a world that is changing faster than some of these people's ethics can keep up, I would like the type of people who get triggered on Tumblr to get over themselves and realise that, instead of showing the world how accepting of others they are, and bitching about cultural appropriation, that other ethnicities can be just as vocally abusive to white people. Hopefully, one day, we can live in a world where anyone, of any gender, sexuality, or race, can say whatever they like about something, and anyone, of any gender, sexuality, or race can call them out and say, 'hey, that was not cool, and makes you a bit of a dick, but I respect your right to say it'.

I would describe their role as critical to our way of life rather than 'a useful utility'.\n\nI'm not sure I follow your point about how exciting banks should be. ",

I mean, you assume I'm an idiot because I challenge your thought process which only limits your self growth, if you dismiss any different perspective you're closing yourself off from so much information. You assume I support Trump rather than realising that I simply take issue with your logic, I guess you're trying to use it as a slur which is jokes. These are not things that someone \"trained to use riguorous(sic) mental techniques\" would do as it limits their personal development.",
