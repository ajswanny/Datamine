They contain an allowance of almost \u00a3250 million per week \u2014 not \u00a3350 million \u2014 for funding that could in principle go to the NHS rather than the EU. But this would involve no state support for any other activities, such as subsidies for agriculture, that are at present funded in the UK by the EU.\n\n>The bigger picture is that the forecast health of the public finances was downgraded by \u00a315 billion per year \u2014 or almost \u00a3300 million per week \u2014 as a direct result of the Brexit vote. Not only will we not regain control of \u00a3350 million weekly as a result of Brexit, we are likely to make a net fiscal loss from it. Those are the numbers and forecasts which the government has adopted. It is perhaps surprising that members of the government are suggesting rather different figures.\n\n>Carl Emmerson\n\n>Deputy director, Institute for Fiscal Studies\n\n",

Most economists have been, for that matter. Maybe this will continue, maybe it won't. But for now their predictions are somewhat tainted.\n\nEDIT:\n\nI've been asked repeatedly what exactly the IFS were wrong on. See below:\n\nOK, so back in Feb of 2016 the IFS published thier \"green budget\", as they do yearly:\n\nhttps://www.ifs.org.uk/uploads/gb/gb2016/gb2016ch2.pdf\n\nCheck the graph on page 29 and the accompanying explaination. Long story short: The IFS predicted 2-2.5% growth each year up to 2020. That means cumulative growth over the three years from 2016-2019 of between 6 and 7.5%. For the sake of simplicity, let's be optimistic and say they predicted growth over the three years of 7%.\n\nThen in May in the run up to the Brexit vote, the IFS published this:\n\nhttps://www.ifs.org.uk/publications/8297\n\n\"The National Institute of Economic and Social Research, whose comprehensive analysis has produced estimates that are in the middle of the available range, suggests GDP in 2019 could be between 2.1% and 3.5% lower as a result of a Brexit\"\n\nSo by 2019, they reckoned our GDP will be between 2.1 and 3.5% lower than previously predicted. So that means that cumulative growth from 2016-2019 will now be in the region of 3.5%-5% over the three years, not 7% as previously predicted.\n\nIn actual fact since the beginning of 2016 we have already grown by 2.5%, with 1.2% growth in the third and fourth quarters of 2016 alone. So that means to fall inside of even the *most optimistic* of the IFS's predictions the economy must only grow by a further 2.5% over the next 6 quarters. This looks pretty unlikely, given that indicators are currently showing an acceleration of the 0.3% growth already achieved Q2 2017 and Q4 is usually the quarter in which the UK posts it's highest growth.\n\nAnd let's not forget: This is pretty much the **most optimistic scenario possible** under their predictions. If we were to take an averaged scenario instead, they begin to look very very wrong indeed.\n\nSECOND EDIT:\n\nLoving the downvotes without any actual valid critisism of my points, it's a badge of honour at this point. The IFS ARE being proven wrong, the facts are what they are. Downvoting me doesn't make this go away. I actually voted Remain, for what it's worth.",

They contain an allowance of almost \u00a3250 million per week \u2014 not \u00a3350 million \u2014 for funding that could in principle go to the NHS rather than the EU. But this would involve no state support for any other activities, such as subsidies for agriculture, that are at present funded in the UK by the EU.\n\nThe bigger picture is that the forecast health of the public finances was downgraded by \u00a315 billion per year \u2014 or almost \u00a3300 million per week \u2014 as a direct result of the Brexit vote. Not only will we not regain control of \u00a3350 million weekly as a result of Brexit, we are likely to make a net fiscal loss from it. Those are the numbers and forecasts which the government has adopted. It is perhaps surprising that members of the government are suggesting rather different figures.\n\n\nCarl Emmerson\n\nDeputy director, Institute for Fiscal Studies",

Based on average human height, that would be more comparable to jumping off a stair rather than a cliff. Risk of injury yes, but low probability and something that we could easily recover from were the unlikely event to occur.\n\nThe \"jumping off a cliff\" narrative is just preying on people's wariness of the future (and hence, the unknown).",

Some were often [very direct](http://whatdoesborisowe.co.uk/boris.jpg) too.\n\nThe moment the result came out they stepped back from it all. Farrage admitted that the figures were wrong. (Although not part of his own campaign). IDS said the NHS would get the \"Lion's share\" which is obviously a pretty vague term. Micheal Gove, (who drove around in that bus too), gave his interpretation of \"Lion's share\" when he pledged 100 million a week extra by 2020 during his failed leadership bid. Less than a third is a Lion's share? \n\nThey latched onto the NHS because it's an issue that directly effects everybody and was enough to help swing the vote towards a minor majority. Ironic since Gove would privatize the hell out of it if he could get away with it.\n\nPeople are still upset because it was a massive lie that forced one of the biggest changes in the country's history.

We've just cut our bursary funding for nurses and are currently undergoing a massive understaffing of nurses in this country. Migrant workers get jobs as nurses as there is a need for them. \n\nYeah obviously I'm glad you agree with me now that we will have to continue to rely on migrant workers such as doctors and nurses and most of the other 11%. \n\nI don't say that as though it's a good thing. I said that to explain my original point to you.  We can't just cut net migration or remove migrant workers because fuckinf 1:10 jobs are done by them - because we desperately need them. ",

And subsequently most died either the next day or in 30 years time.\n\nDoctors often give patents an estimated time left to live - they do this all the time!  It's not always right, but neither is it random - it's based on experience.\n\n>Unfortunately economists do do this. They go and pick a very specific figure even though...\n\nElsewhere on the thread someone talked about the difference between saying, \"This particular scientist is wrong for these reasons.\" or \"This particular paper is wrong because of a flaw in their methodology.\"  and saying, \"Scientists are sometimes wrong, therefore scientists cannot be trusted.\" \n\nOne might be a meaningful criticism, the other is meaningless anti-intellectualism.  Some economists make predictions, some don't.  Of those that do, sometimes they are wrong and sometimes they are right (like the doctors).  That doesn't make their predictions baseless or meaningless.\n\n>They go and pick a very specific figure even though...\n\nNot because the discipline of economics demands it - it doesn't.  They do this because there is a massive demand for this information for obvious reasons, and people want predictions based on past experience and understanding rather than just random noise.  In the same way that the discipline of medical science doesn't demand that doctors give patients the estimated time they have left - it's the patients who ask for this information, again for very obvious reasons, and they want it to be informed by knowledge and experience, even if it is often wrong.  \n\nThe failure of predictions does not invalidate the *whole* field of economics any more than it invalidates the whole field of medical science!  It doesn't mean smoking doesn't actually damage your health, neither does it mean that raising physical, monetary and time-based barriers to trade with your closest trading partners, and throwing away agreements on things like air traffic control won't damage your economy.\n\n>... which means a figure of -1% is likely to be as bad as -5.6% or as good as 3.6%, and often ends up being so far off that they call all their work into question.\n\nIt's certainly hard to predict 2016-19 as that is predicting people's reaction to the prospect of Brexit, which is essentially psychological.  Obviously people did pull huge amounts of money from the UK right away leading to massive currency devaluation, but GDP growth is dependent so much on ordinary people's expectations rather than those who closely observe financial markets.  Certainly though the growth so far in 2017 is the lowest it's been for a couple of years.\n\nIt is a lot easier to predict the reaction of the economy after Brexit once you know the outcome of negotiations as it's based on known knowns.

It's a synonym with Brexit and all the entails. \n\nObviously that isn't necessarily true but making the people of Britain objectively poorer is a pretty definite negative and thus far i'm failing to seeing the positives of Brexit. Since it's happened we've had a division, uncertainty in government, a weakened economy, a negative impact on global politics.\n\nLiterally countless jobs, in loads of different industries. Farmers need seasonal employees for harvest, our public sector is totally dependent on them and the Education system in the UK which need migrant Students. \n\nAn OBR study found that with zero net migration, public sector debt would rise to 145 per cent of GDP by 2062-63.\n\nWe've also got an aging population, our workforce is now paying the pensions of those retired. We need migrant workers to pay the tax on that. \n\nI don't understand why you migration to be reduced so much and what problem you're citing it to the major cause of?\n\nMy original point was, in or out of the EU, we need migrant labour, that is why no government has been able to reduce it massively and no government will. \n\nBasically you're just another guy who doesn't like immigration for whatever reason and will weasel any excuse to justify lowering it, to the extent where you vote for Brexit in the hope immigration will follow and will happily take all the other negative impacts Brexit will inevitable have.
