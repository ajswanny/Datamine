Eighteen months later, and following two horrific terrorist attacks by British-born citizens, that report still remains incomplete and unpublished.\n\n>\u201cIt is no secret that Saudi Arabia in particular provides funding to hundreds of mosques in the UK, espousing a very hardline Wahhabist interpretation of Islam. It is often in these institutions that British extremism takes root.\u201d\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/may/31/sensitive-uk-terror-funding-inquiry-findings-may-never-be-published-saudi-arabia\n\nhttps://www.express.co.uk/news/politics/635774/David-Cameron-worries-Saudi-Arabia-funding-schools-extremism\n\nWe sell arms to them and in return they fuel domestic terrorism.\n\nTheresa May was home Secretary during this time. Not being able to talk about how we came in to this situation *is a form of right wing political correctness.*",

The video is currently trending ~~#2~~ #1 on YT without having been shared on a single major media outlet. This is no small deal.\n\nEDIT 2: This is one of the top stories on UK social media right now and there's pretty much a press blackout. What gives?\n\nEDIT 3: I think we, or at least I, need to disabuse ourselves of notions about the power of social media. The big outlets still have the sway, and unless they take it up, the issue is dead on its feet.",

If the guy gets a decent amount of votes this year, maybe that'll be enough to help him get a few more in the next election, etc., and you would still be showing support for his ideas. Personally I'll be voting for a candidate\u200b in my constituency that basically has no chance of winning, but they're the one I'd most like to win.\n\nI think that tactical voting is a totally valid way to vote if that's what somebody would rather do.

It would be catastrophic and no other country in the middle east would ever purchase UK arms again and the UK would no longer be seen as a reliable supplier in the rest of the world.\n\nIt's important to note that without Saudi Arabia the Eurofighter program would be in serious jeopardy. It is the only launch export partner for the programme and was needed to even consider selling the eurofighter abroad. It is also the only country actively using the eurofighter in combat and a state of high operation readiness. The european customers don't actively procure ongoing maintenance and spare parts needed to keep the program on track. Cut out saudi arabia and the cost of supporting the eurofighter and tornado dramatically increases.\n",

He could have quizzed her about selling arms to Saudi Arabia, he could have quizzed her about education and the NHS where she is seen as weak, the only other thing he asked her other than Brexit was talking about her U-turns. In contrast he asked Corbyn valid questions which he is seen as weak on, IRA, Hamas, Nuclear Weapons, killing terrorists in foreign countries.

You might want to tone down the smugness a bit.\n\nFrom the video:\n\n>\"HSBC have got the job because Theresa May went there.\"\n\nThat is an allegation of some form of corruption at the very least, and potentially an allegation of an offence under the Bribery Act 2010.\n\nNow, prior to the Defamation Act 2013, any allegation of criminal conduct was exempt from the requirement of causing \"real and substantial damage\" to count as libel/slander (Webb v Beavan 1883). That is now at an end due to s. 1(1) of the above Act. However, the recent case of Lachaux leads one to believe that where criminal conduct has been alleged, the court will not be deviating far from its previous practice. The judge in that case approved the position that harm, while having to be proved as a fact, could be proved by inference. And there are very few situations where you cannot infer reputation damage from an allegation of criminal conduct (though Lachaux does provide one example: where the audience was insignificant).",

Only two other banks were allowed in on the deal: DB and JPMC.\n\nI also find it fascinating that HSBC announced a merger with RBS Saudi ventures, which would form the largest bank in Saudi Arabia. I mean, how many years has RBS been trying to sell its Alawwal holdings and being denied by the Saudi government? Then Theresa May closes a trade deal and one month later HSBC announces they are buying that share.\n\nI mean, sure, we can't know exactly what was said during that trade deal. However, HSBC is getting some very favorable deals in Saudi Arabia within a month's time of Theresa's meeting. Why would SA be allowing HSBC to do these things they didn't allow anyone else to do, for years? I find these things extremely unlikely to have occurred without her providing some sort of incentive to SA on HSBC's behalf.",
