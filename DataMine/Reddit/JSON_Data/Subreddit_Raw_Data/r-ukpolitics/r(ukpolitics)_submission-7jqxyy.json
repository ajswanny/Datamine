    "body": "I can't comment on judges upholding the law, but in my opinion neither Brexit nor the election of Donald Trump are strong democratic outcomes, for different reasons. I decided to write this post to lay out some of my thoughts. Please, please criticize and rebut any of my arguments or reasoning. \n\n\n**[CMV](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/\n)**: For a democratic vote to be worth adhering to (to the point of branding as traitors those elected leaders who refuse to follow public will), it ought to fulfill some basic tenets:\n\n* **turnout** it must have such a high turnout that the will over the whole population can be said to be represented\n* **clarity** the voters must be armed with substantial and clear information to make the decision *including* the implications of both outcomes\n* **threshold** is the transition point (between the affirmative and  the negative) properly set beforehand (e.g. owing to the importance of the outcome) ...\n* **threshold clearance** ... and was this threshold sufficiently surpassed so as to render the outcome indisputable in spite of known and unknown efforts to intimidate and cajole the voters *and* efforts to attack the voting system. [IFF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_and_only_if) the threshold is set correctly, then the stronger the clearance the more substantial the democratic mandate.\n\nI welcome any modification, comments, or questions to these somewhat arbitrary axioms but I do think they can serve to be instructive for comparison's sake here.\n\n[The Brexit vote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brexit#Referendum_result) is an example of a democratic outcome which had:\n\n* \u2713 high **turnout** (72%)\n* \u2718 low **clarity**^[a]\n* \u2718 the **threshold** for a vote as serious as dissolution of a union of states has no business being 50/50. Further research is required, but I suspect there are few other places where state union breakup has such a low barrier (in the USA the barrier is literally higher than 100%). And many parliaments require a higher threshold (like 60% or 2/3 or 3/4 in US Congress) for less or equally important votes.\n* \u2713 / \u2718 **clearance** (2%) is 2% above 50/50 enough?\n\n\n[This (Scottish Independence Referendum)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_independence_referendum,_2014) is a democratic outcome:\n\n* \u2713 very high **turnout**\n* \u2713 very **clear** outcomes\n* \u2718 same **threshold** arguments as above\n* \u2713 (55/45) strong **clearance** given the threshold\n\nI'll save the trouble of going into American Presidential elections and embarrassing myself. The [turnout problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voter_turnout_in_the_United_States_presidential_elections) alone is depressing. There is the confounding factor of the electoral college process which causes each election to have a double outcome: popular vote and delegate vote. But suffice it to say that many of them have been **essentially** coinflips. And if you were somehow to know this in advance (that the outcome would be essentially 50/50) then you can save everyone a lot of trouble, a lot of money, a lot of muckraking, a lot of time, and **totally** short-circuit the ability for anyone to interfere with the election by **literally** just flipping a coin for it (assuming a fair coin). It's worth thinking and discussing if this is any more or less democratic. \n\n^[a]: It's clear, in hindsight, that even the political **leaders** had very little idea of what the implications of a yes vote would be. There was no plan for the 'yes' outcome. There was no dry run or consultation about what would happen. It's also clear that they did a horrible job (some might say a maliciously horrible job) in relaying this information to voters. Many major campaign points have now been exposed as [outright lies mixed with false choices](http://metro.co.uk/2017/04/27/heres-how-spectacularly-wrong-the-brexit-bus-350million-lie-was-6600987/).",

    "body": "Depends on the terms of the deal.\n\nBit of background: due to the way the UK's legal system works, the Government is free to sign any treaty it likes, without needing to go through Parliament. But if any part of a Treaty requires changes to any UK law that has to be passed by Parliament as a separate thing. The international law and domestic law situations are kept separate.\n\nWith the EU, the ECA deals with this by acting as a \"gateway\" - an Act of Parliament that automatically (or semi-automatically) brings EU Treaty obligations (international law, signed by the UK Government) into domestic law. But it depends on the EU Treaties; so if the EU Treaties stop applying to the UK (i.e. the UK leaves the EU - with or without a deal), huge chunks of UK law will vanish. Which would be a big problem.\n\nHence this Withdrawal Bill; effectively what it does is say that on a particular date (the \"exit day\") everything that was law because of the ECA becomes law because of the Withdrawal Bill - unless it is excluded. It switches the legal basis of 40 years worth of legislation from the EU Treaties/ECA to this new law, so everything stays legal and everything still works, despite the UK not being bound by the EU Treaties.\n\nWhat this amendment would do is say the Government can't \"activate\" the legal switch-over (under UK laws) until the Commons and Lords have said so. It only affects the *domestic* legal situation, not the EU legal position.\n\nSo if the Government has signed a deal (or if the 2-year negotiating period expires) it doesn't matter whether or not the Commons/Lords approve anything, the UK leaves the EU - as far as the EU is concerned. The EU Treaties stop applying to the UK, the UK loses all EU-related rights and so on, other countries no longer have to uphold those rights etc.. Domestically, the ECA stops working, so 40 years of legislation stops applying (including things like the e-Commerce Directive Regulations that make things like Reddit work without being buried by lawsuits).\n\nPlus according to some parts of UK laws the UK would still be in the EU. At least, it would think it was.\n\nIn practice, not getting approval would mean the Government would have to make sure it has approval before committing to things with the EU, or find another way to deal with this mess.",

If the line was set at 66%, I don't think you debate if 67% is good enough of a mandate.\n\n* **Turnout**: While this is desirable of a democracy, this one also cuts both ways. Recognize votes with too little turnout and, aside from the philosophical concerns, you incent nasty tactics that suppress the vote. Refuse to recognize low turnout votes, and you get what's happened repeatedly in the Puerto Rico referendums where one party just (successfully) boycotts the vote and repeatedly denies it \"legitimacy\" instead of actually engaging and campaigning.

People can be dumb as all fuck on times and want objectively bad things because of knee-jerk emotion.\n\nLet's take an example. Ridiculous, of course, but an example nonetheless to highlight the point here; If we held a referendum on detonating every nuclear device we have in each major city and the public thought \"fuck it, things can't get much worse\" because they've been misinformed about the dangers of nuclear explosions (perhaps there's a bus promising 350 rads/wk or something), and voted 52/48 to do so, our MPs would neither be legally nor morally obligated to follow that referendum result. In fact, given the outcome of such an action, they would be morally obligated to *completely ignore what the public want*, especially given that the vote was so close.\n\nObviously whether the outcome of leaving the EU is akin to setting off nuclear devices in every city is open for debate, but the point here is that there's no moral obligation to follow the wishes of the people if those wishes are objectively bad for them (which, as an aside, would be why extensive and independent studies are needed *before any positive action is taken*).",

Our democratic representatives decided to use direct democracy to inform our policy. We didn't bypass representative democracy as you imply, our representative democracy *decided* that this was the course it was going to take. They are distinctly different things.

Surely you must see the absurdity of reducing it to that?\n\nCan you not see what a dangerous precedent what you are suggesting is? That the parliament can agree to take an issue to a referendum, claim that it is to decide our policy and then when it doesn't go a certain way they say 'I was only joking'? It would complete destroy millions of people's faith in our already floundering system.

(I agree with this). If you are going to hold a referendum, pretend like you're giving the people a choice but if it doesn't go the way you think it should just ignore them and pretend you never really meant it. \n\nYou are also saying that because it was close this should mean it is easier to ignore but if it was remain winning by 52/48 then I know you wouldn't be talking in these terms.
