Despite predictions of immediate financial and economic danger, since the referendum we have seen consumer confidence remain high, record numbers of jobs and economic growth that has exceeded all expectations.\n\n>We have also delivered on the mandate that we were handed by the referendum result. Britain is leaving the European Union and there can be no turning back; and as we look to the future, the government has the right plan for negotiating our new relationship with Europe. We want a deep and special partnership between a strong and successful European Union and a United Kingdom that is free to chart it\u2019s own way in the world. That means we will regain control of our own money, our own laws and our own borders, and we will be free to strike trade deals with old friends and new partners all around the world.\n\n>This is the right approach and it is in the national interest. But the other political parties oppose it. At this moment of enormous national significance, there should be unity here in Westminster, but instead there is division. The country is coming together, but Westminster is not. In recent weeks Labour have threatened to vote against the final agreement we reach with the European Union, the Liberal Democrats have said they want to grind the business of government to a standstill, the Scottish National Party say they will vote against the legislation that formally repeals Britains membership of the European Union and unelected members of the House of Lords have vowed to fight us every step of the way. \n\n>Our opponents believe because the governments majority is so small, that our resolve will weaken and that they can force us to change course, they are wrong, they underestimate our determination to get the job done.\n\n(Her mannerisms and flow during the speech were quite odd leaving me a little uncertain as to how to punctuate the speech.)",

They did. Remain lost - and it's the Government's responsibility to act on that. \n\n\n\nClearly, the tiny (barely) working majority of this government means that there's a decent chance that their agenda will be frustrated - or that significant attempts will be made to frustrate it - and so it's right that the government seek a new mandate for their plans. \n\n\n\nAdditionally, we have a health and social care funding crisis - clearly more needs to be done on that front and I'd be fine paying more in tax to make that happen. But at the last Budget, the government sought to make a small change to the rate of National Insurance levied on the self employed - it was proportional, fair, sensible and would have provided \u00a32bn to bolster funding for social care. It certainly wouldn't have been enough, but it would've been a step in the right direction.\n\n\n\nPutting aside the fact that this policy shift was disastrously communicated - they should've been up front about it a) because they were justifiably breaking a manifesto commitment and b) because people on the receiving end of tax rises always feel like they're getting screwed, no matter how worthy the cause, and so it's sensible not to take them for fools - the move was opposed by Labour (almost inexplicably) and a few Tory MPs. And that's the problem, right now the Government's majority is so slim that a handful of MPs can totally derail a flagship Budget policy announcement that's demonstrably in the interest of the majority of this country's people. That's a silly state of affairs - and so it's right to seek a new mandate to eliminate the problem.\n\n\n\nWhich brings me to my final point. Good government needs good opposition and proper parliamentary scrutiny. Jeremy Corbyn and his top team have repeatedly demonstrated that they're not up to the task - and given the monumental political decisions that'll be taken by the Government in the next couple of years, we need an effective opposition now more than ever. A general election hopefully heralds the return of a sensible labour leadership and a bigger group of Liberal Democrats. It will also provide Scottish voters the opportunity to give an indication of what they really think about Nicola Sturgeon's call for a second referendum (expect some Tory gains in Scotland).\n\n\n\nSuffice to say that this will likely mean a bigger majority for the Conservatives and real potential for the return to some semblance of political normality. \n\n\nI'm ok with that.

Terrible governing. But that's why we have the Fixed Term Parliaments Act (but probably not for long if she gets her way).",

Most Scots are liberal and they could appeal on the basis that they will be most beneficial for Scotland in a coalition with the Tories, rather then having Scotland represented by an opposition party.

Or maybe it's the opposition's apparent lack of any strategy whatsoever.\n\nLook at the run up to the referendum. I doubt they thought the result would be leave so they put Gove and Bojo (the two least likeable tories whose name doesn't rhyme with cunt) on that side, but at least made it look like they were pro-NHS.\n\nPost ref they made it look like there was a leadership contest (and were smart enough to not have it publicy) but really May was the only real possible outcome.\n\nThere was a right time to call a general and it was before triggering A50.

    "body": "That on it's own is not enough. While i disagree with austerity i also disagree with the incompetence of corbyn's leadership.  \n\nI voted for corbyn two years ago because I liked his anti austerity platform, i liked his plan to nationalise the railways, i liked him as a person - he seemed honest and willing to give a straight answer to a straight question (there's a clip of him, Burnham, Cooper and Kendall on LBC and i think it was James O'Brien asks would they offer Ed Milliband a spot in their shadow cabinet and the other three give complete non answers as if they are afraid to be associated with him but don't want to alienate people who like Ed either.  Corbyn straight out says he thought Ed did great work as the environment minister and would like him to take up the same role in his own shadow cabinet. This was incredibly brave, he was willing to publicly endorse a man who just lost a general election while at the same time leaving himself open to public rejection if Milliband turns his offer down - which he did) I liked that he had spent 30 odd years in parliament voting his conscience and had consistently been on the right side of history. \n\nBut he's made a terrible mess of being leader and seems to either not care or to be completely oblivious to the reality of the situation.  I voted for Owen Smith last year, not because i thought he would be a good leader, i find him an utterly uninspiring and vapid individual but i hoped he could steady the ship and stop this death spiral until a better candidate came along. That didn't pan out and any hopes i had of Corbyn coming out of this leadership challenge with a renewed sense of purpose and turn things around were dashed to pieces almost instantly. \n\nI do not turn my back on the party lightly",
