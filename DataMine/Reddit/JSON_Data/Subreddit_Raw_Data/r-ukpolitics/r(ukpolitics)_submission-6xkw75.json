Next group 25-34 turnout just 53%. Age 65+, turnout 78fucking%!!\n\nYup, the blind , the halt and the lame made it to the polls but not the fit and healthy youngsters.\n\nIf the 18-34 age group had just turned out at 50% we wouldn't have a Tory government, so no referendum and no Brexit!!!!! Don't get me started on 2010 election turnout!\n\nWe're in this mess now, not because my generation voted, but because the younger generation DIDN'T. And haven't for election after election!\n\nI've never voted Tory in my life, have no kids but voted REMAIN for the future generation,\n\nSo I voted and you didn't but it's all MY fault? \n\nBoth my grandfathers served in WW1, when my parents were born. They then had to deal with the Depression followed by WW2. My mother nursed RAF casualties during the Battle of Britain, her 16 year old brother was killed on his first voyage in the Merchant Navy. \n\nMY generation built the post war welfare state that keeps so many people out of abject poverty today.\n\nYes, we're not perfect but we still recognise the privilege of the Vote and exercise that privilege.\n\nFoolishly, we imagined that successive generations would do the same. But NO! Well, its your future now and you're just going to have to step up and sort it. But, you know what, I don't think you have the bottle! Much rather keep whinging about how unfair life is for you.\n\nHere's a suggestion, stop being such whiney little fucks and actually DO SOMETHING to create your own future.

Thus, we have young people from relatively wealthy families voting Tory to avoid paying increased income or inheritance tax.\n\nThe ONLY solution to the housing, brexit, inequality crisis is the young getting energised about politics and not falling into the trap of voting Tory once they are no longer perilously close to the breadline.\n\nLabour (Keynesian) policies would benefit society as a whole and would stop disasters like 2008 from reoccuring.",

A deal - this is how economic negotiations work. You have to provide an equal benefit to both sides for a deal to work. Obviously the UK cannot. Hence they will be getting a worse deal as the EU have an upper hand to providing benefits to the UK, not the other way around.\n\n3. The threats - surely any country could have left the EU for decades, but nobody did. It's not about being an arsehall, it's about being fair, which the EU has clearly signalled. You cannot expect being glorified and the EU to be  bent over (which EU did multiple times for the UK) after you leave.\n\n4. Deals - it is in the law that the UK agreed with that you cannot seek separate trade deals while being in the union. As simple as that.\n\n5. Budget - It's around 10%. Taking back what the EU has invested into the UK worst regions like Wales to help out, I would personally (not a professional) opinion put it at around 5%. I believe they can take it easily. \n\n6. Legalities and \"punishment\" - the EU are following every single law there is. The UK though are trying a position (yet again) \"it never has been done before so we need another special set of rules here\" which is not flying with the EU. They got fed up with it. You are leaving - take it by the letter with the law you've signed up for.  that's it. \n\nCongratulations on not living in the UK anymore. Most of the folks want to do the same. Good for you!

This causes two issues.\n\n1. The obvious - space is used inefficiently and so the housing supply shortage is worsened\n2. The less obvious but equally, if not more, important - housing has a massive connection to health, particularly for older people. When you have an OAP doddering around a house that's inappropriate for them, they become a drain on the healthcare system. They can't manage the house themselves so they require constant visits from carers; they're more likely to have accidents from things like stairs, cabinets that are too high etc; and when they do end up in hospital it's far harder to send them home because their home is unsafe. The isolation that comes with age compounds all of this.\n\nThe way of solving this is purpose built, affordable housing for retirees. Sell them homes they can manage, near to appropriate care, and with other people their age nearby. The ideal model is that they sell their old home and move in, releasing a property to the market, giving them a profit to help fund their care costs and living (which gives the pension system a bit of breathing space), and reducing the strain they put on the NHS. All while improving their quality of life. ",

    "body": "I am by no means an expert but have worked in property sales over the past 4 years and my observations have been that the over 60's are a generation that is generally, not exclusively, wealthy (by modern standards - pensions and home ownership). \n\nBorn in the late 40's/ early 50's, they experienced and embraced the boom after the war and were coming of age in the swinging 60's and 70's. If they worked hard and saved well, they were almost guaranteed a home and a comfortable retirement. My Grandparents (more the over 80's not 60's) bought their first home for 4k. And their final home, a nurses (job linked) 3 bed detached bungalow for \u00a320k in the 80's. This property, in its liveable but tired and essentially original state, no double glazing, just thick curtains etc, is now worth 10 x this at \u00a3240,000 minimum (in East Anglia) taking into account the work to do. \n\nThe older generation, if they bought when they did (many didn't as owning property was something certain people just didn't do or believed in doing - the other grandparents always rented and my Nan in London still does in her 90's) are now sitting on potentially hundreds of thousands of pounds of property and essentially, space, that they are not using. They either leave their homes to their children (the over 60's), if they like them, or not. These 'children' then add this to the pot of their own homes, that again they bought for far less then they are worth now and hopefully, if things have gone to plan, they should be paid off with their mortgages by now so they themselves are potentially sitting on two properties values. \n\nThe concept of the over 60's cheaper properties are so that encouraging them to sell up their 3/4/5 bed homes and purchase cheaper and smaller properties so they literally take up less space, they free up the family homes again so the 40somethings can move in and have their time and of course so the 60+s can free up all their lovely money so it can go back into the economy. \n\nThat's the plan. The problem, is that the over 60's are doing very well, thank you very much. They are not the doddering geriatrics we \"millennials\" are told/believe they are (sorry). They travel, they enjoy life after the kids have left, their health is still good and many still work. They have no intention of downsizing just yet and many have no obligation to help with the current housing crisis by freeing up their homes and ask why should they? They use their parents properties money to purchase a buy to let property (even with an increased stamp duty tax on 2nd homes to help slow this) and gain a nice return on investment (better then the banks) and another monthly income. They buy up the 1/2 beds, the first time buyer properties and then suddenly there is nothing on the market for less the \u00a3180k. You have to be earning and you have to have a large, 'good' deposit to get on the property ladder as a first timer and even then if a 'cash' buyer turns up to have a look, the seller is far more likely to sell to the easier cash option rather than having to please a nervous ftb and a lender who may not agree with the way the boiler has been put in! Thus perpetuating the problem. \n\nWe have reached an affordability ceiling which we are struggling to deal with. They try and help with affordable housing quotas on new build developments and shared equity options for younger people or people on lower wages, but they are very few and far between (1 on a 10 property development etc) and the leases are complicated, but if you can get a look at a property like this and you meet the housing companies eligibility requirements these seem to be the only realistic option for people earning a realistic wage wanting to get on the ladder. \n\nWhat I can say is that it is brutal out there on the property market. I don't envisage owning my own property anytime soon. (I think more along the lines of a plot of land and an environmentally friendly, affordable prefab cabin but the land is the issue and still very much a dream). It is a very interesting situation we are facing and very worrisome at the same time. We certainly cannot expect the same life our grandparents or even our parents had and I suppose we will have to wait and see. \n\nTL:DR - The over 60's have cheddar/ The Govt wants this cheddar/ We want this cheddar/ There are other housing options, maybe.

Then Voted tory to pay less taxes and get more pensions and then finished up with one final kick in the nuts with Brexit when the consequences of their votes for Blair and Thatcher meant that that things aren't the same as when they were young weren't coddled enough. It's been the boomer vote driving this every single time with their numbers and while in a position of power they've said 'nah fuck everyone else lo', the reason they're having problems is just because they must be **LAZY MILLENIALS**'. It's the opposite of conservatism it's a generation coddled by giveaways at every stage of their lives from the Welfare state to council home sell offs to tax-cuts to pensions. Conservatives would've realised what the issues this was stoking up would created and I blame Boomers 20% and LabCon 80% for both indulging this attitude of political factionalism to increasing degrees to get to the point we're at today. \n\n\nThen they have the nerve to claim victim status when people to get annoyed at the amount of handicaps and effective taxes you pay for the crime of being born after them.

Those people that tell us to work harder would have us believe that a hard factory worker will one day own the factory. Bull.\n\nA hard factory worker is viewed as a useful tool; not as the hand that should one day be wielding tools. A factory owner nowadays looks at someone pulling double their weight and says \"look, this worker does 200% work and I only have to pay him 103% the wage of a regular factory worker. I've done such a good job at being profitable! Go me! My decision to hire this guy for $24,000/yr was a good one. I deserve $600,000 for making such a good call!\"\n\n\"Oh, you want $32,000 a year for all your hard work? Well that's too high. How about we meet you in the middle at $24,500? You're doing a great job and you're such a big help, you really deserve that $500!\"\n\n\"Oh you want to run this company one day and want to start transferring into the business side to get experience? Well, we really need you on the floor hammering nails. You're so good at it and we wouldn't trust anyone but you to do it!\"\n\n\"You want more money because I said you were irreplaceable, trained, and specially skilled? No. We could get someone else to do it for cheaper and train them instead. Plenty of people would love to have this job. Be happy with your current wage.\"\n\n\"You want more money because the company's volume has doubled in the last year with no increase in staff? This isn't busy. You should have seen back in my day how busy things were. This is easy.\"\n\nThe list goes on.\n\nTL;DR - it's not a market for workers. If you're fortunate enough to get a degree in the field you want to go into that requires a degree AND you find a paying job in that field, then you're a lucky one. \n\nAs for people who start in an industry and build their way up from the bottom as a laborer with ambition: you really need to luck out by finding a company/boss that gives two shits about you and your personal professional growth.\n\nThe job market sucks in this century.",
