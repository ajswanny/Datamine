They are given handouts too. With few of the restrictions that apply to those claiming unemployment. \n\n\n\n\nI know someone earning around 100k. They pay an effective tax rate of around 30% once incentives are factored in. Probably less a lot less. ( Private IT contractor, lots of loopholes), and he\u2019s one of the good ones. Plenty of ways he could reduce it even further. We\u2019ve talked at length about it. \n\nSecondly, saying the rich pay a disproportionate share of the tax bill is not a good defence. They pay so much, because they own so much. Because, income growth in the last 30 years has been delivered for only a small slice of the workforce, whilst everyone else is running to stand still. ",

Look at how all the money has fled from Venezuela in the last few years.\n\nAlso, raising taxes past a certain point simply leads to higher levels of tax avoidance (a problem we already have in the UK). It's all very well suggesting that the rich need to pay a greater share, but on paper the wealthy in this country are already obliged to pay more tax than many other developed countries. In fact I'd argue the reverse: reducing corporation and income tax while tightening up legal loopholes is likely to actually increase the overall taxes collected.

Instead the welfare state has to top it up.",

The highest proportion in decades.\n\nI don't agree with a lot of Tory policy but it is utter tripe that they have given the rich money in power at the expense of lower earners. The British state does a fantastic job at re-distributing income and it is only people's preconceptions and frankly at times the politics of envy that leads us to ignore this.\n\nhttps://www.bbc.co.uk/news/amp/uk-politics-39641222\n\nhttps://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2015/09/redistribution-britain\n\nWe have a problem with wealth inequality, which should be looked at via things like land value tax or possibly consumption taxes, but we do not have an issue with our income tax system being redistributive enough. It already very much is. I would vote for any party that recognised this in a heartbeat. Labour are more interested in populist income tax rises, the Tories can't piss off wealthy land owners. \n\nThe problem is that wealth inequality is hard to tackle and ham-fisted or overly eager attempts can have disastrous side effects if the rich all bugger off. This is a global issue, exacerbated by the number of havens around who will gladly welcome wealthy people seekig to avoid tax. While this isn't fair, without a united global front its hard to see what to do about it.\n\nPeople seem to conflate the Tories with Republicans who frankly are taking the piss by trying to pass off tax cuts for the wealthiest as anything other than frank corruption.",

    "body": "> Remind me how scrapping the personal allowanve for top earners while raising it for lower earners was fitting this narrative again?\n\nBecause:\n\n1) Cutting 5% off the highest tax band outweighs the cost of losing the personal allowance for anyone earning about \u00a3170,000. i.e. over that figure, you're paying a lower tax rate now than before 2010. That's before you factor in a pretty indulgent attitude to tax avoidance (I dare anyone to deny it). \n\n2) The cost of losing the personal allowance, if you're over \u00a3100k, is about \u00a366.00 per week, which is not exactly a fortune for a high earner. But isn't it absurdly arbitrary? Why should you lose out at the \u00a3100k mark but not at the \u00a399k mark and start to gain at the \u00a3170k mark? \n\n3) The growth in the personal allowance is commendable, *but* not only does it merely continue to implement changes which have been broadly consistent since 1988 (during the financial crisis apart); but at most gives the average taxpayer about an extra \u00a324.60 per week after inflation. It's not exactly Santa Clause territory. That's before we get into the effect of spending cuts. \n\n4) People earning more than the personal allowance *aren't* on the lowest rung of the ladder. They're people without a reliable income or any income. Their funding has been relentlessly cut for the past 7 years, massively increasing homelessness, among a hundred other social ills.\n\nSo in other words, under the Conservatives changes since 2010:\n\nIf you're the \"\u00a310,000 man\" you've saved a small fortune and sacrificed nothing. \n\nIf you're the \"\u00a32,000 man\" you've lost out, but by a small amount . \n\nIf you're the \"\u00a31,000 man\", you're better off (probably), but by a tiny amount. \n\nIf you're the \"Unemployed man\", you've been completely hammered into the dirt.\n\nSo I suppose the way in which it fits the narrative is that the Government's tax and spending policy has crushed the poorest, helped the richest, and has tried to cover that up in propaganda terms by putting a little squeeze on the upper-middle and relaxing a little on the lower-middle, but so little that it's basically meaningless. \n\nThe argument would presumably go that these are all worthwhile sacrifices for the country's overall economy; which is fine, I guess; even if I disagree. But lets not pretend that it isn't happening. \n\nEdit: a typo",

What they left out is that she's disabled, never indulges herself, and amassed the money by putting away whatever she could afford over the year so she could give her kids a good Christmas, like any good parent would want to do.\n\nAnd out-of-context stories like hers are taken as an excuse to lower and lower and lower benefits (because god forbid benefit claimants ever treat themselves to distract themselves from how shit a life of poverty is, I hate this idea we have that it's \"self care\" if you're middle class, but \"unforgivable self indulgence\" if you're poor) until people are dying in their thousands because the DWP has set quotas to cut existing benefits and reject a certain percentage of claimants regardless of need. And all because some odious Tory-voting pinchpennies falsely presumed they had either the right or the knowledge to dictate how much benefit claimants should live on, even though all evidence points to tax dodging/evasion by the rich as a much bigger drain on tax income, and that leaving the poor to rot like this government has incurs bigger costs for the taxpayer in the long term than giving them benefits does.\n\nSo I'm sure you can forgive me for not giving a solitary damn about m/billionaires crying about losing out on a bit more superfluous wealth when we're treating poor and disabled people like subhuman garbage to keep the greedy cunts happy and based in the UK.",

Just in case you missed it.\n\nIt's weird that Denmark has such high wealth inequality, but they aren't a utopia we are working towards.

You could say \"make the most profit while not breaking the law\", or \"make the most profit while not being caught breaking the law\" ;)\n\nThis Fitness Function has been very successful, but actually only works really well in a couple of specific circumstances: ideally you want small, dense items, with a very high selling price.

One is pharmacology: it makes more sense to work on a very expensive erectile dysfunction pill to sell to a relatively small group of rich people, than to work on a cheap cure for a very large market but made up of very poor people.\n\nJust as the government forces corporations to add \"without breaking the law\" to their \"make the most profit\" fitness function (e.g. no dumping toxic waste, no mistreating your workforce etc.) we need to rethink our Fitness Functions: one size does not fit all.\n\nSome things it makes sense to not look at the financial profit, but the social profit.",

Because they measure using a hard current cutoff, it doesn't really tell us anything about how those people's lives are actually improving. \n\nThe next is that China is responsable for the vast majority of this poverty reduction, but didn't actually compete in globalism to do it. China's poverty can mostly be attributed to internal reform rather than globalised policy. Additionally, they use mercantilism not free trade to achieve wealth accumulation. \n\nThis goes into a lot more depth\n\nhttps://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/8705312\n\n",

My income remains largely the same, what is different is the psychology behind it. Understanding that this \"extra\" money is money that is \"given\" by the government is a lot easier when its a direct transfer (benefits), as opposed to an allowance for reduced tax. \n\nIf for example, we have a system whereby you paid the tax, then receive it again later via [regular] payment. The outcome is exactly the same. (Aside from the \"regular\" component specified this does happen with some tax breaks. You pay it, then get it back). \nThe main difference is psychology.\n\nThe issue is that individuals who get tax cuts (and can use them) are generally higher earners and can *often*(though, not always) \"manage\" without the additional income. [Incentivising certain kinds of behaviour notwithstanding] \n\nAdditionally, tax breaks often have less clear effects than are first suggested. Whist, they are really politically popular. (No-one enjoys paying tax!) In many cases they don't do what we want. Help to Buy & Stamp Duty tax policies are recent examples of giving to those who \"don't strictly need it\" to incentivise behaviour [home ownership] with little effect. In both cases, empirical evidence suggests the policy has had negligible effects and may have driven prices higher, further undermining stated policy goal [explicitly: Increased ownership. I have read some papers that both policies (and others) are intended not to boost ownership, but to maintain the mortgage market as banking system isn't as stable as suggested] \n\nIn many cases, the rationale for tax cuts is based more on flawed theory rather than sound economics, (often driven by supply-side assumptions that don't hold true). Sometimes tax breaks are necessary. However, the moralising that often comes with it- is in my view- misplaced. \nIt's easy to demonise the poor. \n",

Yes we had a \"hand in their wealth\" but that's because we got something back in return (whatever we bought from them). The transaction ended there.\n\nIf I buy a pencil off you and we both agreed to a price of 50p, there is no reason why I would get a say in how you spend that 50p. I departed from my wealth (50p) on the agreement that you give me a pencil that I deem worth 50p to me in value. That is a basic transaction.\n\nScale it up if you like. My whole town of 100 people buys a pencil each (they agree that 50p is worth it). You now have \u00a350. We do not get a say in how you spend it. We agreed to the deal.\n\nThe *only* possible justification for me telling you how to spend the 50p is if we agreed that the price is 50p if I get to tell you how to spend it, making that the terms of our deal.\n\n\n>especially when the rest of us give back portions of our income that affect our standard of living more than the amount they give.\n\nThis is still not a justification for taking more of someone else's money disproportionately more. This is because they didn't steal the money they have from you. The reason you have less money is not their fault. This means they still get the same treatment (pay the same proportion of tax as you). It is still immoral to take more of their money because they made more, since they made it by providing people something of value which they agreed to.\n\n>And it\u2019s not like they don\u2019t get a say in the decision on how much they give anyway, usually with a voice that is disproportionately loud relative to the rest of us.\n\nYes, I too disagree with cronyism and richer people influencing law-makers to benefit themselves.

Not that this is really important.\n\n>It was only ever raised to 50 from 40 by Brown on his way out as a fuck you to the Tories\n\nOr probably as more of an act to raise a bit of extra revenue with the size of the deficit causing concern. There was probably also general politics to play with much of the population thinking bankers/the rich had go them into this mess so why shouldn't they pay more. Not that I think notably raising taxes or introducing cuts during a recession with interest rates basically at the zlb and QE going on is a good idea (bit hazy on the timeframe of some BoE actions though).\n\n>I totally agree on housing policy. The state of housing and the amount we piss away on propping up demand with housing benefit and help to buy is a farce decades in the making.\n\nI'm not sure we do agree with housing policy entirely. Help to buy certainly. But I view the issues with housing benefit as a secondary problem from issues with supply. Removing housing benefit (or some sort of payment to help the poorest to have a roof over their head) won't do anyone any good. The real point is that the benefit cap (aka why should a family receiving benefits get more than the average earner) is only an issue due to the high cost of housing (mainly in london/south east). The government would be better served by fixing issues with supply (density, green belt etc.) rather than pushing some of the worst of in society down the ladder so to speak.\n\n >Maybe it is lazy but its no lazier than the rallying cry of taxing the rich more.\n\nThat depends surely? There are reasonable arguments for a LVT, maybe a wealth tax that effectively work out as taxing the rich more.",

The UK already has a relatively high degree of income redistribution. And yet we also have a relatively high degree of wealth inequality. If we consider that to be a problem then the only sensible way to really tackle it is a taxation based on retained wealth. This not only tackles the disparity of wealth but economically discourages people from hoarding what they will never need and encourages spending and investment. I believe such a taxation system would be our best shot at a more equal society and a better economy. But it would be a very hard narrative to sell because the status quo is so firmly income based taxation, to speak about wealth based taxation makes you sound like a loony commie, even if you're not. That, and there would be genuine issues around double taxation\n\nI'm quite disappointed with the current Labour party for not bringing this into discourse. They are in a perfect position to do so, and I believe that Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell privately consider wealth based taxation to be the way forward, previous comments on land value tax allude to as much. If they could at least set the ball rolling on the discussion it would be good to establish it as an option on the table and bring it into the public mind",

He spent all of his writing/journalist/activist career advancing the cause of democratic socialism. \n\n'Every line of serious work that I have written since 1936 has been written, directly or indirectly, against totalitarianism and for democratic socialism, as I understand it.' -George Orwell.\n\nAnimal Farm isn't an analysis of human nature. It's a critique of Stalinism and the USSR. Orwell thought that the ideals that were at the heart of the October Revolution were worth fighting for, but ultimately realised that Stalin corrupted those ideals and had made a totalitarian sate-capitalist regime. Orwell despised Stalinism (and all forms of totalitarianism/state opppression). That doesn't mean he didn't think socialism would work. He took a bullet in the neck for a socialist revolution. That link is an opinion piece, not the beliefs of Orwell. The historical revisionism around George Orwell is frightening (he'd probably have an aneurysm if he could see it).",

Additionally, the article explains most of China's poverty reduction happened because of land reform not capitalism itself. For it to be capitalism and not just technological progress, you would have to show that a small group owning and organizing the means of production (which is actually owned by the state not private organisations in most cases) is what caused the people to come out of poverty. \n\nIt was pretty much just internal reform and taking advantage of free markets not participating in them. China's economy functions specifically to take advantage of capitalism, not to use it  \n\n\"In China the poverty trend could instead be attributed to internal factors such as the expansion of infrastructure, the massive 1978 land reforms (in which the Mao-era communes were disbanded), changes in grain procurement prices, and the relaxation of restrictions on rural-to-urban migration. In fact, a substantial part of the decline in poverty had already happened by the mid-1980s, before the big strides in foreign trade or investment. Of the more than 400 million Chinese lifted above the international poverty line between 1981 and 2001, three fourths got there by 1987.\"\n\nhttps://www.scientificamerican.com/article/does-globalization-help-o-2006-04/",

Reducing this tax bill productively by paying higher wages and investing in future growth is much more useful for a company than giving it away. Govt revenue declines but company is now thinking long term and improving lives of staff. ) \n\nSo yes, higher taxes may reduce govt revenue gained directly from said taxes  But, taxation can serve other purposes, these other purposes may additionally offset the reduction in tax revenue. (Higher salaries = more payroll taxes. Less reliance by lower paid staff on social security, increased consumption etc.. standard multiplayer stuff)\n\n\nLower taxes encourage a company to hold wealth or to pass it on to shareholders/executive salaries. Which is a less socially useful activity. \n\nThis is a fairly well known element of (Keynesian) economics. Taxes don\u2019t only effect revenue, they modify behaviour. \nOf course, this is also contingent on a tax regime that seeks to mitigate avoidance, but I think we\u2019re moving in such a direction globally. \n\n[Before someone says \u201ccompanies will just leave\u201d. A large company will still want to pay 70% on 10m. Than 0% on nothing.  Tax structures can be targeted at varying company levels/sizes. ]\n\n\nI\u2019m not advocating 70%. It\u2019s purely explanatory. The real value is contingent on industry/company size. \n\n\nTLDR: Laffer Curve is BS.   But even if we assume it isn\u2019t. It\u2019s still Missing half the picture. Tax incentives behaviour. We can use it to improve salaries. ",

Don't take everything they say as gospel. Even so, I believe what they actually said was that the 50p rate of tax did raise more revenue, just not as much as expected.\n\n> If the rich pay more, their tax has gone up, even if the line has come down. Don't think of it as a percentage, think of it as a lever. If pulling the lever towards a lower percentage INCREASES the amount taxed and the revenue of the country, then tax has gone up. Just because economics isn't simple doesn't mean it isn't true.\n\nWhat you're describing is the laffer curve, which is actually an oversimplification of how taxation works. There is lots of debate of what the optimum rate of tax should be, but little evidence that it should be under 50%, most estimates put it much higher. In the UK, we didn't have enough data to work with, the 50p tax rate only lasted for 2 years, it was announced a year in advance meaning that anyone who was able to bring forward their income to avoid the tax would have done so, and it was then announced after 1 year it would be cut in the next year, so anyone who was able to defer their income would have been able to do so. I believe this was a deliberate tactic, if the tax had lasted longer there would have been data proving it raised more revenue and the Tories would have had a harder time politically cutting it.",

    "body": "See my other responses. I think I've adequately covered this point, but in an effort to be more succinct. \n\nThere are some objections to the claim that 100% is as bad as 0% (one of the links I posted in my other comment covers this point). I can appreciate these objections, I don't necessarily agree with them.  That said, the claim behind the Laffer Curve is more than 0/100%. It's that lowering taxes encourages investment, innovation and boosts growth: due to a very clear transmission mechanism. This is empirically falsifiable: and it has been.  In some circumstances this might be a solution, in most there are preferential regulatory changes that will have more effect]\n. \nAn issue with the Laffer Curve is that it is contingent on too many other factors to provide any useful policy implications. Assuming the 0/100% claim is correct, the empirical research has yet to find a convincing estimate. Those that provide policy based on their research, often run counter to accepted solutions. (See \"Laffer Curve Revisited\" Uhlig  & Trabandht 2010. They had policy proposals that had clear expected outcomes. IMF assessed them in the WEO 2015, along side a few position papers and found they didn't have the expected effects. What did happen was largely what was expected based on conventional economics)\n\nSecondly, almost all economists (Keynesian or otherwise. Only Marxist economists I expect would disagree) will agree taxes moderate/incentivise behaviour. Focusing solely on revenue, ignores those instances when we might want to use taxes to do something other than generate revenue. The (hypothetical) lost revenue may be offset by other factors. IE: Having a 90% tax on income in X type of industry may be worth the loss in revenue if it encourages other more desirable outcomes. This is more of a conceptual point that empirical. However, a fair amount of ongoing research is being devoted to looking at how higher tax rates during the 1950~70's resulted in greater internal company investment. I discussed this in my another comment.\n\nFinally, the Laffer Curve is often used on high incomes only. Tax cuts for really high earners produce these desirable outcomes (growth, innovation etc), tax cuts for lower earners don't. This is problematic. When applied to companies, the implication is that reduced taxation will boost investment. This isn't evident in the data. Often, higher executive salaries, share buybacks and dividends take the place of investment. [In isolation, there isn't anything explicitly wrong with these outcomes, they are not however what ought to happen based on the theory]  ",

It's been slow). I've read literally thousands of reports/articles/journal entries in the last 18 months: I'm lucky to remember half.  I prioritise the stuff relevant to me and half remember the rest. \n\nThe stuff on investment/taxes is from 3 years ago when I was writing my MA thesis on Austerity and Supply Side economics. I focused on interest rates as a mechanism for market discipline, (At the time, theory was Austerity was good, cause we wanted to avoid a solvency/currency crisis. Cutting spending reduced interest rates, and made us look credibility to markets. Very very few economists thought it was a good idea, even fewer though it was expansionary, the aforementioned Alesina was one: he was wrong, the empirical data I worked with was fairly conclusive on that front.). My readings on the laffer curve were tangential to the thesis but piqued my interest, partly because of the deference shown to it. \nThe short end was, its not very reliable:  its largely theoretical, but it is empirically suspect. It was largely ignored when it was first proposed by the Supply-Side tradition. It refers to very specific circumstances: marginal tax rates in high tax regimes (Which we most certainly are not), and only for Govt. generated revenue, unfortunately it is often applied universally.\nThe empirical testing that was done showed that revenue from higher taxes only started to reduce at around the 60-70% bracket. (This of course ignores the secondary effects, which are deleterious at much lower levels. But this is rarely the point when invoking the Laffer Curve)\n\nThat said, I'll google scholar to see I can spot readings that are familiar, my notes for my MA these are buried in an attic somewhere, that is probably the best I can do.",

    "body": "As before, this isn't the stuff I read years ago. but its broadly in the right direction. Most of it is quite technical, and it requires a fairly solid understanding of econometrics and economic theory to really appreciate some of the discussion, but I hope it helps. \n\n\nSome useful material: \n\n\nHere's a paper (for Sweden) showing 70% still generates revenue for Govt.http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/261018 \n\n[Here's the short summary in case you can't access it, it's also very technically demanding]\n\"IV. Concluding Remarks\nThe analysis here suggests that high taxes on labor income can have quite significant effects on the sale of labor in taxed markets when alternative untaxed uses of labor exist. In this way, taxes can and probably have affected the recent growth performance of the Swedish economy. *Further, the treatment permits the conclusion that total tax revenues in Sweden would be maximized at a tax rate of roughly 70 percent*, which is 10 percent less than the rate prevailing today.\" [Emphasis mine, note this article is arguing for tax cuts based on the Laffer Curve...]\n\n\nAnother source:http://www.nber.org/chapters/c11222.pdf (P.197)\n  \n\"The results from over sixty simulations are summarized in table 10.1.The first column shows the total revenue resulting from different labor tax rates using the basic model's value of. 15 for the labor supply elasticity with respect to the net-of-tax wage. The \"observed\" total revenue of$362.54 billion corresponds to the basic tax rate of 31.8 percent, and *total revenues are positively related to tax rates, up to a tax that is 70.0 percent of gross labor income. Beyond that rate, revenues start to fall*.\n[It's important to note, NBER are broadly friendly to supply-side theories: this paper runs a few alternatives for elasticity producing different effects: As I said, Laffer Curve is dependent on too many external factors to be actually useful ] \n\nhttp://www.dorfonlaw.org/2016/06/the-laffer-tic.html  This is a fairly good \"non-academic\" discussion.\n\n(The Kansas experiment he mentions is actually very damning for the of \"supply side economics\". Lots of people say it kills the Laffer curve as a concept too. My personal stance is that there's too many changes in this \"experiment\" to accredit it to any one policy [Ie: cant really say for sure that revenue was reduced because of the Laffer Curve, because they changed too many factors to assign causation], but it certain kills supply side theory as a unified policy regime.\n\n\nVery interesting discussion going on in the comments of this article: \nhttps://waitingfortax.com/2015/09/07/laffer-curve-an-elegant-useless-idea/ \n\nDiscussion is about how unreliable the Curve is, and how different methods get different results. The context of what tax, when, and other institutional factors are just too complex to calculate it effectively. (As I said in my earlier post, its highly unreliable)\n\nI'm aware that much of the debate these days is about people \"hiding\" their money with higher tax rates. http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2008/01/the-new-laffer.html ) \n\n\n\nI hope that helps, I read through those when I posted, the 2 articles are very technical and a broadly in favour of proposing tax cuts but show that tax at a 70% level still generates revenue. \nAs I said before, the Laffer Curve is very problematic, it would take a lot longer than a reddit post to get into it. The short is, that the empirical data is weak, and the claims don't add up to much. The reality is the world (and tax) is a lot more complicated than oft. claimed. The Laffer Curve is often badly used, in part because it is designed that way. ",
