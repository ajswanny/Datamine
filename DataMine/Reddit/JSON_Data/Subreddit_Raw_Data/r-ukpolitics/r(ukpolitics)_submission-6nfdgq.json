I doubt an overwhelming proportion of people using food banks would prefer not to rather than using them \"instead of paying for food\". I mean... We have nurses using food banks in the UK. \n\nAs for your second point, argument based on personal experience isn't always the best way to avoid confirmation bias. \n\nLet's look at he IMF which have already said that growing inequality in both the US and UK relates to the top of society having large tax cuts (so much for trickledown economics and neo liberalism), and specifically the UK, even though I'm not really a labour supporter, we can't ignore that the IMF have said that under the old labour government, changes in social care and tax lowered inequality when compared to their inherited Tory neoliberal system. It should come as little surprise then that a policy of selling off public land, the NHS, benefit cuts to the disabled, salary caps on public sector,  and tax breaks for the rich there looks to be increasing inequality again. \n\nSo no, I'm not happy to hear that citizens are rallying to refill food banks, I'm discusted that we seem to have an increasing foodbank problem and rising inequality. Our present subhuman attitude towards certain rungs of society based on opinion and not fact makes me think that we are on a vary dark road to a very dark place.\n\n(source http://uk.businessinsider.com/imf-study-on-income-inequality-2015-7 containing link to study, http://www.imf.org/external/np/fad/inequality/ and https://www.google.co.uk/url?q=https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/sdn/2015/sdn1513.pdf&sa=U&ved=0ahUKEwjh9OXXxozVAhUpJMAKHQcbA08QFggRMAI&usg=AFQjCNHltWZieevR_sbrW2sa6arNMiI-Ow\n\nEdit: just realised the Donald is your favourite sub and can't decide whether it's a good thing I spent time responding as it may encourage positive debate, or a bad thing as I may have just wasted my time...",

The data is all public (tax rates, tax receipts).\n\nThe correlation between Corporation Tax Receipts and the Standard Corporation Tax Rate between 1971 (it was introduced in the late 60s) and 2016 is -0.89. Which on the face of it, looks really, really strong.\n\nBut when you [look at the graphs](http://imgur.com/a/0Mjdl) it turns out there's an even stronger correlation between the Year and the Corporation Tax Rate (-0.90) and the Tax Receipts and the Year (0.97) - so all that figure is telling us is that Corporation Tax Rates are generally going down, and Receipts are generally going up (which we'd expect).\n\nIf we compare the Receipts as a percentage of GDP (the second chart) we see a lot less clear picture. And a correlation of -0.53; so pretty meaningless. We get a similar figure when looking at Corporation Tax Receipts as a percentage of total tax receipts; -0.57.\n\nTechnically the last time the UK reduced Corporaiton Tax (21% to 20% in 2014-15) Receipts did go up, both absolutely and as a percentage of GDP *and* as a percentage of tax receipts, but... the relative change was pretty insignificant (a 5% drop in tax rate, a 6% increase in receipts, but a 1.9% increase in receipts as a percentage of GDP).",

The 'mights' are to let you know its not as simple as \"goddam conservatives are making poor people poorer!\" or that the city's economy is getting worse. It could be *getting better and richer!*.\n\nBut your absolute doesn't stand as the default truth. this is what I'm telling you. You don't get to decide it means what you think it means and 'mights be damned'. YOU are giving a 'might' suggestion as much as any. I will show you how foodbank use could mean other things.\n\n>IMF which have already said that growing inequality in both the US and UK relates to the top of society having large tax cuts\n\nThat could mean a major jump up for unemployed and the working poor! \n\nBut you want 'equality' for some reason. I'm not sure why but to put this in perspective: You think its terrible and wrong if Bill Gates becomes a multi-billionaire 10X over while all his neighbours working and living in the Microsoft boom are only becoming millionaires 2X over and the Janitor is only making $100,000 a year working there.\n\nBut it could be not taking as much tax money from big corporations lets them get bigger and hire more people and pay those people more. \n\n>to be increasing inequality again. \n\nI don't know why you want income equality? If that is your goal then I'd welcome you to China to see the last remaining (actually it's gone yesterday) but the last remaining successes. Everyone became equally poor.\n\nA beautiful world where all people, big and small only owned one suit, where everyone washes clothes in the same creek, where rich and poor alike now have just meat twice a year and live on rice and mice if they can catch them. \n\n>So no, I'm not happy to hear that citizens are rallying to refill food banks, I'm discusted that we seem to have an increasing foodbank problem and rising inequality.\n\nI was VERY HAPPY to learn a food bank in Fort Mac was desperate for donations and so let me explain why:\n\n- The city was, at the time, having a massive economic oil boom. While you'd be very upset and indignant about the income disparity because the lowest paid workers were making more than most doctors and the bosses double that (so quite the inequality!) but some of us feel great about that. \n\nThe city was overwhelmed. Men who'd been unemployed for years or had never seen more than $9 per hour at Burger Barn were driving pickup trucks full of their clothes and friends and the city couldn't even keep up. \n\n(now, in a sense, yes that is 'bad' in that they couldn't build enough houses, rent enough rooms and shelters were filling faster than they could handle it).\n\nFood Bank. The food bank wasn't really because people were becoming poor. In my other city, it was because crews of new workers would show up and earning more money than they'd ever seen before (more than you and me combined) BUT at age 21 didn't have enough money in pocket until their 1st paycheck. \n\nThat is a 'good problem'. That is GOOD 'Food Bank Need'. It's not the same 100 people using the Food Bank month after month. When you hear 150 used it... its not 100 of the same ones plus 50 new regulars. No. Its almost always temporary. \n\n>So no, I'm not happy to hear that citizens are rallying to refill food banks,\n\nGeez.. but you would be happy if citizens rushed the same exact money to a government agency that cost far far money than the food and then they redistributed the money through a government process???\n\nCitizens giving direct cash-in-hand or 'food-to-bank' is WAY MORE EFFICIENT and gets way more food way faster *directly* to the exact needs. \n\n> just realised the Donald is your favourite sub and can't decide whether it's a good thing I spent time responding as it may encourage positive debate, or a bad thing as I may have just wasted my time...\n\nThis is an 'ignorant' mentality. Or we also call it 'bigotry' and the biggest problem is where you make truth 'subjective' based on personalities and categories of people you create in your own mind.\n\nYou shouldn't give a shit who I am or what I do but instead consider the facts and do they apply here? Is it true?\n\nbut that's why you'd make a good leftist - 'truth is what you make it' depending on what victim-oppressor categories are involved. \n\nWhere as I'd say 'What is True?' and then look for that objective truth. Regardless of you existing or being a half-tard or a bigot. \n",

I'm not just providing you with an opinion, I'm providing you with research, not from a political party, but from an independent, who's findings support and inform my assertions, not the other way round. On the 'might's' I don't think we are on the same page and I can only give you evidence, whether you choose to challenge that with something more than opinion or not.\n\ninequality stifles growth (again IMF findings on the links provided) and what you are describing is trickle down economics - which again, the IMF has said doesn't work (Era Dabla-Norris; Kalpana Kochhar; Nujin Suphaphiphat; Frantisek Ricka; Evridiki Tsounta (June 15, 2015). Causes and Consequences of Income Inequality : A Global Perspective. International Monetary Fund. Retrieved June 25, 2015.). Your response makes me think you don't understand what inequality is. Dictionary definition is: Economic inequality is the difference found in various measures of economic well-being among individuals in a group, among groups in a population, or among countries. So the opposite of this is not 'equality' as you've presented it.\n\nI am not saying that people should be paid the same no matter what they do (I am not what I think you consider \"communist\"), but I do want people to be able to work to have a decent standard of living. . If I work 40 hours a week as a janitor, I should be able to live off this. If I work 40 hours a week as a doctor, I should also be able to live off this, albeit, to a standard of a living that reflect my expertise. So, I'm saying that if the poor are getting poorer and the rich are getting richer, it's bad for everyone - it's raising inequality,\n\nI think your understanding of food bank use in the UK is maybe based on your own experience, not empirical evidence. We know that wages haven't increased in the UK, we know that benefits have been cut for the disabled, we know that there is a larger proportion of working poor, we know that there is a larger amount of inequality which is bad for growth ( as per the IMF and as an example, people spend less for a start as they have less free money), so your example isn't based on the a UK situation. \n\nAs for my comment about the Donald, maybe a misconstrued your original comment as possibly trolling. I'm glad you responded. \n\nAs for truth, objective truth is based on evidence, which you haven't provided and I have. We clearly are worlds apart politically and geographically, but I am willing to have my views challenged with evidence. \n\nI don't do name calling so I'll leave that there.\n\nPs. If you haven't seen it before, I would recommend checking this webisite. It would be interesting to see if your responses actually do tie up with your support for Donald\n\nhttps://www.politicalcompass.org/analysis2 - UK positions\nhttps://www.politicalcompass.org/uselection2016 - American positions\nhttps://www.politicalcompass.org/test/ - test to compare against your own",

My original comment, let's remember, was picking up on this part of your comment:\n\n> they actually have a system where the street folks, living off foodbanks and welfare really can become successful and even wealthy and within just a few years sometimes.\n\nThe implication here is that a zero-welfare-state system powered by charity enables some people to \"become successful and even wealthy\" but, inter alia, my point was that actually, the USA has more people who are less likely to become wealthy than other countries with well-developed welfare systems. I then linked to some evidence of that in the form of a chart showing how poor the USA's social mobilty score is compared to other developed countries.\n\nI did this in order to suggest that your idea that charity and foodbanks promotes social mobility is actually incorrect, and that countries with strong welfare safety nets actually do a better job of allowing the extremely poor to succeed and become wealthy.\n\nFinally, the sentence \"Its a low-IQ.\" has at least two punctuation errors in it, as well as being irrelevant. (Never mind that IQ is far from perfect as a measure of general intelligence.)

You just might be a dumb person. \n\n\n\n>Your response makes me think you don't understand what inequality is. \n\nThen you just might be a dumb person. Let's see if you copy and paste it from a smart person (though we can select many various definitions) but let's see if the smart person uses the same definition I did with you:\n\nYou pasted: *Economic inequality is the difference found in various measures of economic well-being among individuals in a group, among groups in a population, or among countries*\n\nYes, that's the definition I was using. \n\n> So the opposite of this is not 'equality'\n\nYes, actually the opposite would be economic equality. \n\n>but I do want people to be able to work to have a decent standard of living. . If I work 40 hours a week as a janitor, I should be able to live off this.\n\nRight, well that is definitely what we want for everyone but suppose you take a job testing video games at home for 40 hours a week? \n\nBut here is where you have the other angle of this. I know the USA a bit better than the UK and here is what you'd want to see:\n- I'm going to one of the poorest neighborhoods in any given US city. The poorest people who are earning the *lowest wages* the law allows. \n\n- The average poor person has a heated (or cooled) apartment or even a full free standing house with a yard and driveway! They have at least one television, they have a mobile phone and almost certainly a smartphone and convenient WIFI access. They actually have enough food to be overweight and eat out at a burger barn. Get this.. they probably even have a vehicle or someone in the family does. It actually runs. They have 24/7 emergency access to 911 to instantly send highly trained ambulance or police. They could get emergency care for zero dollars. They have candies and snacks and wash their clothes in an electric washer and dryer. They have a fan, microwave, kitchen, a flush toilet and a shower. \n\nThis 'ghetto' and the people are.. and really really grab onto this ... they are WEALTHY PRIVILEGED PEOPLE LIVING A LUXURY LIFESTYLE OF EXCESS TO 90% OF THE PEOPLE ON EARTH. \n\nReally really grab that and think about that. 85% of the people here in China WISH THEY HAD SUCH LUXURIES AND TREATS AND COMFORTS! \n\n20 minutes away there are people with porsches and houses so big they've never even seen some rooms, they eat at luxury restaurants and I swear to you they are so wealthy they can actually hire people to make them do fake labor (exercise) because they don't actually need to 'do' anything anymore with their bodies. \n\nThe inequality is stunning and the poorest people in SloughFerry UK are quite literally 100X richer and have more luxuries and comforts than most human beings living on Earth now OR EVER IN HUMAN HISTORY. \n\n>We know that wages haven't increased in the UK, we know that benefits have been cut for the disabled, we know that there is a larger proportion of working poor,\n\nYes, the UK has a massive socialist situation that will always always lead to this. Canada is not far behind. The USA is going the opposite direction since about 8 months ago. You will have one very large class of 50%+ who are dependent on social services and who can blame them because being in the working poor category is a punishment. Then you will have your smaller owner class. \n\n>I would recommend checking this webisite. It would be interesting to see if your responses actually do tie up with your support for Donald\n\nYes, pretty much. \nEconomic Left/Right: 1.38\nSocial Libertarian/Authoritarian: 1.69 \n\nBut I don't suppose those are as good as all my British friends seem to think and post on FB. I'm far closer to Trump mainly just being a pragmatic or 'practical' conservative. IF there is a need that can be met with socialist help then I'm all for it if the market is blocked up on something. \n\nBut what I'd love to see is the UK with a 97% employment rate. which is 100%. Then we don't need a large government agency dispensing food every month at a cost of 100 with only 1 or 2 going directly into the hands of the needy.\n",

You would absolutely see VERY WIDE economic inequality happening as big shot money dudes were going up and up and top spots were hiring already successful folks and the workers were actually going DOWN and in zero opportunities. \n\nAnd then they opened the doors and holy fucking shit the 'Help Wanted' adverts and they could NOT get enough people hired and then approximately a month later - holy shit McDonalds was BEGGING teens, adults and seniors.. i mean BEGGING them to please please work for them. \n\n>you don't see to want to actually discuss evidence, but force opinion and hyperbole instead.\n\nthis is the opposite of what is happening. I am directly engaging in the very real tangible situations and how they really work on the ground. \n\nYou are citing some article written by some thinktank without comprehending the how's, why's or even understanding why 'The UK' isn't May's district in London. \n\n> as if I present facts,\n\nThe best you've done if found a smart person's broad economic theory and pasted it. Seriously. But you have a low IQ so you somehow think that means you are the 'facts presenter' but discussing real world events, actual practice and variables is stuff that is like \"makes no sense... like.. some opinions and not copy and pasted text derrrr!\".\n\n>you have sunk to name calling;\n\nProbably not but that is your 'out'.\n\nanyways, but yes please do fuck off for a while, thanks.\n\n",

    "body": "It boils down to ideology. The Tories are ideologocally opposed to the idea of a welfare state. They believe individualism is much more important and useful than collectivism. \n\nKnowing this, we can analyise their handling of the welfare state (which of course includes services such as the NHS, police, fire service, public housing etc as well as cash benefits - and is indeed collectivist in nature) whilst keeping in mind their ideological position. When services appear to be failing, we can question whether or not the government is genuinely trying to run an effective and efficient service, bearing in mind they are ideologocally opposed to the very notion of it as a public service in the first place. \n\nOf course, no one is saying, for example, that the government does not want an effective and efficient healthcare service. Though it is fair to argue that they would much prefer a private national service, paid for through ability rather than one that is accessible to all regardless of whether or not they have paid for it. However, what would be the consequence to our government openly admitting to privatising the welfare state? Probably being left out of power for decades, and any attempt to do so being reversed after a maximum of 5 years. \n\nSo we can ask, in the case of the NHS, why is Jeremy Hunt Health Secretary? The vast majority of NHS staff hate him, he has absolutely no experience or qualifications relevant to the job and the NHS has consistently been described as 'in crisis' for years. Is he doing a good job? - seems not. The man has openly written in the past that the NHS should be privatised and has suggested ways this could be achieved. \n\nSo, the question 'is the government trying to systematically undermine the NHS' is a fair one. That doesn't mean they are or they are not, but there is plenty of basis to suggest that they are. ",
