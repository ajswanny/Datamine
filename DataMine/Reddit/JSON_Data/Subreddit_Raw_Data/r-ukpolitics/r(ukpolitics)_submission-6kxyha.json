He opposes illegal immigration to the US, and stricter visa requirements for people coming from the ME to the US. Are you really that outraged that he demanded a bunch of continental free-riders pay their NATO dues? What does that have to do with you? Reacting to him like he's domestic political opposition is completely ridiculous.  \n\nShowing extreme partisan hostility to a **foreign leader**, one the UK is pretty much dependent on at the moment for its general well-being, just shows how thick most of you are. \n\nHe isn't a member of your government, you didn't vote for him, his policies as it relates to everything except the UK should be mostly irrelevant. Do you all just watch too much TV and forget that the US and UK are entirely different countries? Taking on the angst of California Democrats doesn't help you or your country. You aren't trying to oppose him in an upcoming election, you're risking fucking up your foreign relations, and blowing a shot at any potential trade deals.\n\nIts foolish. ",

The press have gone after Corbyn for sure, but there's such an enormous difference between the spin against him and the factual reporting against Trump.\n\nTrump is a traitor and had knowledge of Russian influences in the election. Corbyn has done nothing of the sort.\n\nTrump is a billionaire with a horrendous business track record. He'd made so many businesses bankrupt that any US institution stopped lending him money in the 90's. That's why he had to borrow money from the mob and the Russians. This is all on record. Look it up.\n\nHe's gone on record to show his disdain for 'poor' people a few times. That's why he's taking away medicaid for 22 million of the poorest Americans whilst giving tax reliefs to the richest 2%. Look that up. It's true.\n\nThe Steele dossier... Read it and get back to me. Also, if you think that's fake, then you're denigrating the professionalism of MI6. Be careful there.\n\nEither:\n\nRussia has Trump by the balls, somehow. Either because he's guilty as shit or through some other form of leverage.\n\nOr\n\n\nTrump is too stupid to see how this looks, too weak to defend America, and too narcissistic to admit he had help winning, even though he's actually innocent.\n\nPick one.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNow read this. It's long but shows the true scope of what's happening in the US right now, and there's a lot more where this came from. This isn't simple smear campaigns (nothing like this has been written about Corbyn) this is true Nixon-style criminality.\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2017/world/national-security/obama-putin-election-hacking/?utm_term=.029d92c40a07",
