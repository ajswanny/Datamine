    "body": "My view on what is needed:\n\nA guaranteed secular education for every child - if a child is born into a very religious family, they're already going to have more than enough experience of their in their general family life and at places of religious worship. School should be somewhere free of that, where they can experience the other side. We can ensure that things like sex education, evolution, the Big Bang and other contested topics can be taught to every child. A significant minority are currently trapped in a cycle of religious family life, religious worship and religious schooling with little hope of escape.\n\nThe ending of religious privileges - there are currently things that are legal unless they are done for religious purposes, in which case they are illegal. A good example is not stunning animals before slaughtering. This is illegal as a general rule, but there is a specific exemption for religious slaughter under Schedule 12 of The Welfare of Animals (Slaughter or Killing) Regulations 1995. This is wrong. Not stunning is either right or wrong; it cannot become right simply because it is done for religious reasons. This perpetuates the idea that religious belief gives a special entitlement over and above ordinary people.\n\nSecular clothing - this is linked to the above. If an employer sets a dress code, that dress code should be followed by all employees. Religion cannot be an exemption. Again, this treats religious belief as giving a special entitlement and normalises this belief in the minds of both those who practice it and those who observe it. To illustrate, I'm pretty sure that if I said somebody shouldn't wear a hat in the office, everybody would be in agreement. If I said the same thing about a hijab, I'd be in trouble. Yet there is no real difference between them. They're just fabrics put on a persons head. Clearly though the idea of religious privilege is widespread.",

I can do the experiment and if the ball accelerates differently according to my measurements then I'm wrong.\n\n'God created the universe 5 minutes ago' is not falsifiable. What experiment could I do to disprove this that can't be countered with 'god made it that way'. That doesn't mean it isn't true, and this is actually a bit of a problem even for scientists. The second law of thermodynamics seems to imply it is in fact *more* likely that the universe popped into existence recently (I.e. The atoms randomly jiggled their way into this current formation) than the universe starting in the low entropy state of the Big Bang. \n\nThat's not to say I think that God did it, just that scientists don't have all the answers, take some things on faith and that some questions may never be answered.\n\nScience makes all sorts of philosophical assumptions, called axioms, that are not provable. We assume the outside world exists. We assume the universe is isotropic. We even make contradictory assumptions for different physical theories: 'The mathematics of quantum mechanics describes a real phenomena' vs 'the mathematics of quantum mechanics is an incomplete model of reality' \n\nBasically.

It can't just be removed because it's so deeply intertwined with many peoples, communities, and lives.\n\nI think the best way for us to support quality discourse over Islam is to promote those progressive voices within Islamic communities, giving them platforms and resources, and engaging in dialogue with those willing.\n\nMocking a radical fringe is very rarely a good way to convince people to your side and when so many communities feel alienated for the Islamic beliefs that are intrinsic to them we only widen the gap between them and us.\n\nI feel like the same goes for all groups to some extent. Good discourse should be based on respect for the other's humanity and their ability to think as a rational being (if we don't believe in this then we may as well already concede). Through showing that there's a place for these people in our society, even if that place is contingent on their renouncing or softening certain beliefs, we can begin to mend the gaps that give birth to radical extremists.\n\nThe battle for hearts and minds is the most important one but the one that we least like to fight because it's very difficult.",

One was led by a man who was considerate of western values, progressive in his approach to accepting women's equality and homosexuality. The other was led by a real radical conservative who believed that scripture should be applied to the letter. \n\nThe former was initially successful in uniting Muslim's under a more modern and accepting form of Islam, while the latter became a smaller splinter movement. Unfortunately, the media didn't care to understand the difference, and applied the same scrutiny and suspicion to both, which was reflected in public opinion.\n\nEventually the more tolerant school began to fragment, because its members didn't understand why they would strive to integrate with a society that levelled such negativity at them. So the two schools merged, and adopted the more conservative and radical position. \n\nThe key to all of this is not to treat Islam as monolith. It is not. There are a variety of schools and interpretations, some of which are entirely compatible with western living. These we should embrace. ",

Religion is a personal choice, and therefore is only a personal consideration.\n\nUnfortunately that's not quite how all of this works. \n\nIf you make sex education mandatory then you will have Muslim families pulling their children out of school.\n\nIf you make the halal slaughter of animals illegal then you effectively develop a black market for meat, otherwise Muslims would all have to become vegetarian. \n\nIf you allow employers to ban visible religious wear, it is effectively a ban on the hijab by another name (though also orthodox jews). You make it more difficult for Muslim women to go out and seek employment - which can already be difficult for them, as a  break away from cultural norms. \n\nSo yes while your ideas sound nice in theory, they would actually drive more of a wedge between the Muslim community and the rest of society.\n\nLet's look at these issues from a saner perspective. \n\nIf you allow Muslim families to exempt their children from sex education then at least they still receive a mainstream education in the sciences and history etc. \n\nHalal slaughter actually doesn't preclude stunning before slaughtering. The point of contention is that stunning itself can't be what kills the animal. If you stigmatise halal (including by the proliferation of false information) then you marginalise Muslims via the food they eat. \n\nIf you allow without question the Hijab in the workplace (except for where it may be a safety concern, machinery etc) then you encourage Muslim women to participate in society, and you help to solve a significant problem in wealth disparity for the Muslim community. \n\nAnd why not allow it? It is not harming anyone else. That used to be the foundation of British values: As long as you obey the law of the land and don't annoy anyone else, you can do what you want. Unfortunately we now have a whole concept of being annoyed on behalf of other people for manufactured reasons. ",

The atoms randomly jiggled their way into this current formation) than the universe starting in the low entropy state of the Big Bang.\n\nIt does no such thing.\n\nTo claim that a universe created five minutes ago is more probable than a universe with a big bang (and justifying something on the basis of the second law of thermodynamics is just a fancy way of saying \"it's more probable\") you need to propose a 'universe generating mechanism' that pops out different types of universes with different probabilities. No such mechanism has been hypothesized, so no such statement as yours can be made.\n\n>Science makes all sorts of philosophical assumptions, called axioms, that are not provable.\n\nThat's not entirely wrong, but I'd put it differently: philosophy makes assumptions on science's behalf, whereas science just sort of gets on with it.\n\nEveryone agrees that *something* needs to be assumed at the outset in order to justify scientific statements (theories, consequences of those theories etc), but it's very unclear what that is, and the work that goes into investigating this is not itself science.\n\n>We assume the outside world exists.\n\nThe statement \"the outside world exists\" doesn't really have a scientific meaning.\n\n>We assume the universe is isotropic.\n\nWe don't *assume* the universe is isotropic, we hypothesize it on the basis of the fact that (i) it looks isotropic and (ii) we have no theoretical reason to think it isn't. But this could easily be overturned if new evidence contradicted it.\n\n>We even make contradictory assumptions for different physical theories: 'The mathematics of quantum mechanics describes a real phenomena' vs 'the mathematics of quantum mechanics is an incomplete model of reality'\n\nSorry, that doesn't make sense to me (your statement, not the putative contradiction).",

Context should be examined in determining whether a practice has anything to do with \"faith\", or whether it is an established tradition which no longer serves the purpose it once did.\n\nThe Torah contains hundreds and thousands of rules and regulations, which served a purpose at the time they were written.  Food handling, hygiene, disease control etc etc - most of which have little or no relevance to the world we live in.  \n\nSome see those rules as a path to god, others follow them because they have been told to.  And that brings me to the bit I disagree with...  I don't see a problem with \"organised religion\", though I have (obviously) a massive problem with what has been done, and is done, in the \"name\" of those religions.\n\nIf a religion expects behaviour that the wider population deems wrong (rather than stupid or illogical) then that behaviour should be stopped - but if people decide they don't want to shave, or they want to have two fridges, what harm does it do anyone else?

The cartoons were printed in a small newspaper, no one paid attention until a group of Danish imams went to the middle east to advertise them (and even add their own fake caricatures to make the Danes look even worse).

Now we even have many well meaning people who say that the caricaturists went \"too far\", and this was islamists' end game, to blame ourselves for their own violence. In the end the Danish newspaper and Charlie hebdo were both very small newspapers that had been making fun of religion (for decades in the case of CH, with much worse caricatures of christianity) , and no one would have paid attention if islamists didn't intervene. Now they've managed to shut us down and we won't see anymore caricatures of their religion, and many well meaning people will think it's a great thing. Respect earned through violence. ",

I think we have to say yes, otherwise other people's fears become a kind of tyranny.  It also has to be put into its historical context, this idea of death if you depict Mohammed is quite a recent phenomena, there are lots of depictions in Islamic history & its not even mentioned in the Quran.\n\nAt the end of the day, in a free society, your freedom to declare death to a cartoonist for a one frame picture is not greater than that cartoonist's (or by proxy any publisher of said cartoon) right to draw and show that cartoon.",

Take ISIS. They claim to be the re-emergence of \"Real Islam\". When they are really a disguise for people to go to war and pay out sick fantasies of murder and rape.

    "body": "I suppose I am an atheist although I dislike the term as it's plain weird to have to have a name for a non-belief in something for which there is no evidence.  I don't need a special label for my non-belief in unicorns for example.\n\nYou say \"as a scientist I don't like to say anything for sure\" which I consider a weird position.  I think it's perfectly OK to say \"I don't believe in anything for which there is no evidence.\"  There is an equal lack of evidence for fairies but I bet you don't claim to be open about their existence.  This is just one of the ways religion gets unfair treatment.  It's no different in terms of supporting evidence to any one of a massive number of supernatural claims yet we laugh most of them off without fear of causing offence or claims of \"prejudice\".\n\nCan you give an example of a question science is not built to answer?  What do you mean by the Big Questions?  I don't really buy into the idea that \"there's just some things we'll never know\" or realms of knowledge that are forever unattainable.\n\nIf religion is a forum for ideas outside of science that provide comfort well ok...  I guess there is nothing wrong with believing something if it makes you feel good.  Doesn't make it true though.  And if it's outside of science it seems to me it's unfalsifiable.  Indistinguishable from fantasy so what's the point?  To merely feel good is small comfort.  \n\nBesides most of the push back against religion has nothing to do with how it makes its adherents feel.  It's that they claim to have special knowledge that requires us to change the way we live our lives.\n\nI'm not advocating banning religion.  I just think criticising bad ideas should be OK no matter what the topic is.  I agree banning religion would be counter-productive.\n\nIf i'm \"prejudiced\" against ideas that have no evidence to support them I'm OK with that.  I think we all should be.  I don't make it a practice to attack people. In fact I carefully word my responses even online because religion lives close to the part of the brain where people store their personal identity and they are very unlikely to change their minds when you criticise religious ideas even when you bend over backwards to do it politely.\n\nYou don't sound like you are that ok with criticism of religion.  When you say \"it's legal\" you imply it's allowable begrudgingly but undesirable.  I feel the same way about loud exhausts on cars.  I recognise it's legality but find it annoying. \n\nI would argue we should all desire for bad ideas to be openly criticised without fear of offence or reprisal.  It's just better for people and society to foster open forums where people can defend their ideas or change their mind when they recognise their belief is incorrect.\n\n\n\n",

No, because the definition of invisible literally precludes seeing it. Anything you _could_ see... wouldn't be. \n\nCan you prove (or disprove) the existence of God? No, because the definition of a deity precludes you ever doing so. \n\nI'm generally prepared to let that one go as such an argument, and something that is unknowable. \n\nBut I also don't hold that it follows that you can build on an unknowable thing into any sort of chain of logic.\n\nYou can read a book (any book), and enjoy the story, draw wisdom from it, gain some insight and perhaps even understand some of the historical context. And this is true of Holy Books too. \n\nBut I don't see how the chain of logic of 'inherently unknowable God' leads to an assertion of any sort of extra 'weight' to the various holy texts of the world. That's not to say they can't be insightful and moving, and convey useful messages through narrative and metaphor though. But this is true of many books, not just a select list of 'special' ones. \n\nSo by all means, lets debate a piece of scripture and the message and wisdom within. But this is something that either stands in it's own right - or not. It doesn't get a special pass because faith. ",

We have found no evidence to suggest any deity's (or indeed anything supernatural) exists and, as you say, we can therefore reasonably not believe in them.  \n\nI dispute we don't know what we are looking for when we speak of Deity's.  Depending on which particular one you want to look for you could absolutely devise a method of seeking it out.  Various scriptures make a myriad of testable claims. \n\nOf course we can't prove a negative.  That is why we can also dismiss without evidence the assertions that such things exist.  The burden of proof rests on those claiming a god exists. \n\nI agree that if something is unknowable it's time to let it go.  This is the crucial point I think we differ at. It seems to me at this point you decide \"well I can't know that it's false so I'll stay on the fence.\" Whereas I think this is the point at which gods fall into the same category of \"things for which there is no evidence\" that should be automatically not believed in as a kind of consistency of thought. \n\nEnjoyable discussion!  I feel like we are pretty much on the same page a couple of wrinkles of logic notwithstanding.  I agree with you that invoking deity status or \"inherently unknowable\" adds no weight to an argument.  As you say, and I wholeheartedly agree, arguments should stand or fall on their own merit.  Discussing the claims and messages of scripture, some of which, I agree are moving and insightful is a worthy project.  Of at least equal importance is pointing out the failures of the disturbing and destructive parts.  \n\n",
