The government financial problems was because the Labour government decided only to adhere to Keynesian economic policy when it suited them, and instead of sensibly building up a surplus to mitigate against an inevitable fall in consumer demand at some point, they spent more and more on various vote winners (and wars). Which was fine because there was \"no return to boom and bust\". But Brown, was obviously wrong and thus running a large deficit before consumer surplus plummets is madness. You want to be running one to prop up demand while consumer confidence recovers. But you can't if that's going to plunge you into 100%+ GDP-debt ratio because that's the point where lending becomes risky and you go in the direction of Greece.\n\nAs to his policies - yes I did read the manifesto. There's a lot I disagree with in principle but even the stuff I agree with in principle is unrealistic. His promise of abolishing tuition fees (and any outstanding debt, as he tacked on) is absurdly idealistic. It would cost \u00a3100bn up front and be a continuous drain on government finances forever more. Unless we want to go back to sub-10% university enrolment (which I'm personally not necessarily against) then that's never going to happen. Increasing tax on the 80k+ and increasing corporation tax (when decreasing it actually brought in more revenue) is a great way to lose investment just at the moment we need to be doing everything we can to encourage it.

The argument will differ depending on why you want the fees to be dropped, but if it has anything to do with discouragement of people from poorer backgrounds I'm happy to link ample evidence against those claims.\n\nIncreased suport of the NHS isn't something I disagree with, simply the way they wish to fund it. Had brexit not been happening corp tax rise to match Europe and increased upper tax rate would not be as large an issue, however given current circumstances these options aren't feasible due to the already increasing capital and investment flight from the country.\n\nNationalised rail was fine, I saw no issues with it from the manifesto.

Reducing the bill back to 3k is going to require a tax increase, in turn either taxing everyone at a rate of near 1.5% more or the \"1%\" by 8%, i'm sure you can see the dangers of doing that. If you wish to turn the UK into a higher tax system however that would be different. We could copy some European countries models and raise taxes by 6-10% across the board, but then this carries risk now because of brexit. \n\nAnother point is dropping that fee down to 3k is actually going to help richer people more, currently the payback is designed so that you must be earning a very large average salary to fully pay it back. 9% over 21k, this would mean under our current system the people who earn the highest payback the most.\n\nThe only action I wish to see is the cap freeze removal, the contracts to be binded and immune to future governments changing them retrospectivley",
