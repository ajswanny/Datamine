It's added a whole new level of complexity to the whole (and already complex) process.\n\nYes, May was stupid to call an election, especially so close to the EU negotiations. She should be holding her head in shame.\n\nHowever a hung parliament is the WORST result for this country overall. \n\nEdit: for the downvoters - how about explain why a hung parliament is good? \n\nI presume your stance is that now the 'Conservatives' can no longer do as they please. However they will still push for their policies and if they do not get majority approval then we are stuck in either no-mans land or they will have to agree to amend their stance. \n\nEither way it does not bode well for the EU negotiations and increase our chances of getting 'no deal'. \n\nA hung parliament has added a layer of complexity. \n\nEdit 2: come on guys, explain?

This means if we want a lite Brexit then one has to accept that many of the public's concerns will not be addressed which then brings up the topic of 'why' did we have the referendum in the first place!?\n\nEither the EU reduce the need for all single market members must adhere to the economic freedoms (no hope of that by the sounds of it) or the UK try to force them to be more accepting by making it clear we're happy to go the hard Brexit/no-deal route.\n\nPeople had the chance to prevent all this had they made their voices heard during the referendum.",

She took a gamble and lost.\n\nHad she maintained the majority then there would be no oppositional resistance preventing her from pushing her policies. Now she has to form a coalition government. She has to 'win' the backing of the joint party in order to continue her negotiations with the EU.\n\nThis has resulted in a new layer of negotiations that we can deem 'local'. She needs to first negotiate with the joint party before bringing the policy to the EU negotiations table.\n\nThe elections resulted in a hung parliament. The Conservatives under May's leadership will still push for a hard Brexit. It is what she believes the majority of the UK voted of those who turned up and voted during the referendum. What we are now seeing is that an additional party that now have a say in the matter. However the Conservatives could either choose to continue 'as-they-were' or they can amend their stance to bode well with DUP. \n\nDUP can now push for change but that is unlikely to bode well with the Conservatives. \n\nThis will result in disagreements. Disagreements that will delay the negotiating process while the EU divorce process ticker remains ticking.\n\nSo I think you're focusing on your opinion on what's better for the country, presuming you want to Remain in the EU. In my opinion that ship has sailed and we need to accept the referendum result. Yes, we can hope that May adopts a less aggressive stance but the reason she is so fixated on a hard Brexit is because the EU have already made is clear that the benefits inherited from being involved in the single market can only be achieved by adopting their economic freedoms (which for example includes free movement of people). It's a lose-lose situation. Either May reveals her cards and accepts the criteria to continue being a member of the free market but fails to address the leading policy of the leave campaign (controlling migration) or she continues to push for a hard Brexit to address many member of the public's concerns at a cost to economic uncertainty. \n\nMy comment focuses on the EU divorce process and how we are more likely to see failed negotiations that could lead to the dreaded 'no-deal'. A hung parliament is not good for this country at a time when we need to be at our strongest. \n\n> About 64% of registered voters aged 18-24 went to polls, study reveals, but 90% of over-65s voted - Guardian - Referendum Turnout\n\nIf young people were so concerned about leaving the EU then why didn't they vote in such high numbers when it really mattered!? \n\nA few things that are clear:\n\n* The EU are unwilling to negotiate - to be fair, they are in a stronger position and can call the shots\n* The referendum resulted in 'leave'. People had the chance to sway the result but many failed to capitalize on this opportunity\n* May has to address the concerns of the public that lead to so many people wanting to leave the EU in the first place\n* The UK cannot address those issues unless the EU are willing to negotiate (they are not)\n* May believes her only options are to either play 'hard-ball', hoping the EU change their stance or choosing for the UK to leave the single market\n* Many people will not approve the decision of readopting many of the EU's policy by going to lite EU Brexit route as many of the leave voters concerns cannot be addressed\n* The UK is now far weaker because of the joint coalition as we now have additional layers of local agreement needed even before attempting to negotiate with the EU\n* The EU will now use this uncertainty to empower their position\n\nSo, I ask - Is a hung parliament good for this country? My opinion is certainly not. We are now far more likely to receive no deal and that will be catastrophic. Our position of  negotiation is now weaker. The EU will capitalize on this and with further disagreements locally will prevent a deal from being done. May in my opinion never wanted a 'no deal' outcome. She however wanted it to be known that the UK wouldn't be held to ransom. The EU will not budge and her attempt of accepting a hard Brexit/no deal outcome would have struck a cord with the EU to rethink collaboration would be better than the inevitable. After-all both the UK and the EU having something to lose albeit the UK more-so.",

I do wonder how many, especially the less politically literate, fully understood what a Brexit meant (as well as what was intended by the Tories). You're right in saying people had their chance to avoid this in the referendum. They also have the right to exhibit a displeasure in how things have gone since then and where things look to be going.

The UK is changing. The British culture is on decline. Many employers favor migrant workers as they are known to work hard, complain less and are often unaware of their rights. Zero contracts are common. People who reside and wish to remain in the UK long term not only have to compete in the jobs market but have the added cost of living and bringing up a family (i.e. mortgages, children etc.) whilst many migrant workers choose to work in the UK on a temporary basis. This is part reason why controlling migration was top of the agenda.\n\nDo we need migrant workers? Certainly. Should we at least have a form of control to prevent market saturation? Definitely. Most leave voters were unqualified people that worked low-skilled jobs. These are the exact people feeling the direct effect of market saturation.\n\nI shudder at the thought of people calling 'leave' voters racist. A handful, yes. Majority, no. There is nothing racist about controlling something that is affecting your lifestyle or opportunities, especially when the EU force policies that force the public to just chin up and accept it. ",

She was wrong. She has caused more damage and now we are even weaker. She took a gamble for self motives. She wanted a full term and saw an opportunity capitalize on Labours weakness. Add that to her manifesto and the bizarre and undoubtedly crazy pledge for the working class to pay for their own illnesses out of their estate which is basically a tax for people getting ill. It would then leave the persons children losing out from financially gaining in a country that is undoubtedly getting more expensive. Just look at how many young people now rely on the bank of mum and dad just to be able to afford a place to live.\n\nAs for the working class and topics like job security, wage stagnation etc. I fully agree. I can and do sympathize with the many people feeling the pinch and are scared or unwilling to accept the negative outlook. Cost of living today is expensive. I hold a professional job, I'm university educated yet still live with my parents and even with most of my money going towards my savings, I cannot get anywhere near the amount to afford a simple flat (living in the South East). House prices are rising up to 10%+ a year yet I have't had a pay-rise in 3 years. \n\nNow imagine how people must feel working unskilled or unqualified jobs. Not only do they not receive good pay but they have to compete with an ever saturated market, reduced opportunity and poor outlook.\n\nAs for Corbyn. He is not a leader. Most of his own party even turned their backs to him. The reason he did better than expected is because those who wanted to remain saw that voting for him provided an opportunity to stick two fingers up at May, the leave campaign and the hard Brexit. What it has actually done is caused additional weakness, further uncertainty and now prevented us from getting the best deal from the EU negotiations. \n\nEven if we do choose to go the soft Brexit route, many of the EU policies that prevent the leave voters concerns from being addressed will have to remain. If so, why did we have the referendum in the first place if we are going to replicate our EU membership but no longer be an EU member? The EU have expressed time and time again they will not negotiate on the four economic freedoms.\n\nPeople should have simply voted when their vote mattered, not try and turn the vote by causing additional complexity that will now affect us all for the worst.",
