It's the process whereby the rules of our society are made; it costs our money, it runs our lives, it has significant impact on almost everything we do.\n\nIf I like jazz and you like rap, we can each enjoy our own music and coexist. If I like spicy food and you prefer sweet food, we can each make our own meals. This simply isn't true of politics; we all have a stake in this country and when two competing visions meet, they must clash or compromise; they cannot both be fully implemented.\n\nNow, democracy is a wonderful, splendid thing. It allows for peaceful resolution of these clashes of vision. But I find it incongruous for people to pretend that impassioned, vigorous (even sometime verging on the rancorous) debate about it is strange or excessive. The current level of civility with which politics is conducted is unusually high on the long historical scale, not unusually low.",

Yes it is understandable but I think it sub-optimal and divisive.\n\nYou observe, correctly, that one difference between musical and political opinion is that people can enjoy different kinds of music without interfering with each other, whereas the same cannot be said about competing visions for a country.\n\nThere is another key difference as well.\n\nWith music, your opinion is validated purely based on the thoughts in your head. If you prefer Metallica to Bach then it is quite strange to suggest that your opinion is wrong (although people do try and do this all the time). The claim (that you like X more than Y) is made true because you think it.\n\nWith politics, much of the disagreement is factual. For example, people in the comments below are suggesting that various policies will result in the deaths of people they know. Those of the opposing view are probably more likely to disagree that this will be the outcome, as opposed to actively seeking the deaths of your loved ones. So these are testable claims that can be verified and found to be true or false.  As a result, people can be mistaken about their political opinions, in a way that they can't really about their musical opinions.\n\nBut the problem is that our worry and concern causes us to hold onto beliefs long after they have been dis-proven. Our powerlessness encourages us to accept wholesale systems of factually unrelated beliefs. Our sense of justice closes us to other points of view and the flaws in our own views. Our righteous anger turns our opponents away, instead of reaching an optimal solution.\n\nSo the problem with passion is it actually diminishes the factual element of politics, and makes political opinion far too much like musical opinion. I can have a political opinion about the safety of a nuclear power plant, despite knowing very little about nuclear power, because I am passionate about renewable energy or about saving jobs in the nuclear industry. That passion uproots my opinion from reality, causes needless conflict and poor compromise.",

This is a suture to stop the bleeding but needs a proper next step to heal the wound.

Additionally, they funded a puppy out of their own pocket because the waiting list for a trained autism dog was months.\n\nThe Tories have cut funding to mental health services, which means he is just another number on another waiting list when he goes looking for professional help - his university councellor has been wonderful, but it simply isn't enough.\n\nHe recently had the initials of my parents tattooed on his neck, and the initials of my other brother and I on his knuckles to remind him that there are still people that give a shit about him.\n\nAs it stands right now, I am fully expecting to lose my little brother within the next half a decade.\n\nEdit: I don't know why you would downvote my experience, whether it be due to disagreeing with how we've handled the situation or simply lack of belief, but I truly hope you all at some point in your lives have the chance to at least walk beside those who suffer daily.",

Basically, you can estimate how many people 'should' be expected to die per year with surprising reliability for large populations. Deaths beyond this are 'excess deaths'. They're not necessarily (*although I think for some studies can be*) categorised such that \"death A is expected, death B is excess\", it's simply \"actual deaths - expected deaths = excess deaths\" (*plus statistical margins etc, etc*).",

Those two things don't add up dude. \n\nThat said, it's funny how so many supposedly left wing people who believe in helping the many poor and not the few are suddenly all in favour of the entitlement to get free money from elderly relatives when they die, despite having done nothing to earn it?\n\nNo one has a right to inherit hundreds of thousands of pounds just because their parents bought a house when times were good and then voted for a series of governments that have made home ownership an unachievable target for many people today. \n\n>she will pass it on when the law changes rather than lose it, and rent a little shithole until she dies\n\nDoesn't seem a sensible idea to me. You just told me she couldn't afford to eat without the winter fuel allowance, presumably her house has no mortgage (as you keep telling me it's all she has, if it's mortgaged then it's partly the banks anyway). How is she going to afford rent?

Sure she may not live somewhere that has relatively cheap homes, but then again millions of young people, people like you, cannot afford to buy a home due to high house prices and are trapped paying rent. So now you're defending the elderly not paying for their own care, meaning you will need to pay more taxes, just so your gf's parents can inherit up to \u00a3100,000. \n\nBizarre. \n\nThe amount of young people defending what is frankly a justified and warranted reduction in tax expenditure on the elderly is staggering.

You also tell me that she has no assets other than her house, and no savings.\n\nHowever, she must own a house worth more than \u00a3100,000, which isn't unusual, but you tell me apparently her pension is so large that she could afford to *rent* at a time when rent prices are through the roof (so yeah, it is an odd concept she can afford rent on a shit pension, people can barely afford it on a shit wage). You also insist she is going to lose the winter fuel allowance, which is going to be means tested and still provided to poor pensioners.\n\nHopefully you can take a step back and see that this does not add up. She is either so poor she can't afford to eat, in which case she will not lose the winter fuel allowance, or she has enough money coming in that she will lose the winter fuel allowance and can afford to rent. These situations are mutually exclusive as the means testing for winter fuel allowance is not taking the house into account.\n\nI've not said you're lying, I've said whoever is telling you all this is wrong, because it's inconsistent. It makes no odds to me whether your GF has a poor or a rich grandmother, but she can't have a grandmother who is so poor she can barely eat but also so rich she won't qualify for the winter fuel allowance.\n\nBut hey, why bother trying to address the inconsistencies in what you're saying when you can make strawman arguments and address those instead eh? Instead of addressing these inconsistencies, you say things like \"Well all you're expecting her to do is sell her house and move\", when I never suggested that, and some stupid shit about bootstraps, which is laughable because I never mentioned it.\n\nYou keep talking as if you're someone who believes they are a left wing person, who believes in helping the poor and the many not the few. I could be wrong, but that's the impression I get. So here we get a policy where people with significant sums of money have to pay for their own care and not pass that money on to their kids who never earned it, and you're attacking it!\n\nTell me this. If your GF's grandmother lived in a council house paid for by the tax payer, on her state pension paid for by the tax payer, receiving her winter fuel allowance paid for by the taxer payer, receiving social care provided by the tax payer and she had all that while she had \u00a3100,000 in cash in her house, would you think that's fair? Why are you defending the fact you're going to have to pay more and more taxes to provide for people just so other, richer people can inherit money?\n",
