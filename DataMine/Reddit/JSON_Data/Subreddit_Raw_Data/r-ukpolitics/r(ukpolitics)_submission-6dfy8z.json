Because you are disbelievers**\n\n> \"We hate you, first and foremost, because you are disbelievers; you reject the oneness of Allah \u2013 whether you realize it or not \u2013 by making partners for Him in worship, you blaspheme against Him, claiming that He has a son, you fabricate lies against His prophets and messengers, and you indulge in all manner of devilish practices.\"\n\n> **2 . Because you are liberal**\n\n> \"We hate you because your secular, liberal societies permit the very things that Allah has prohibited while banning many of the things He has permitted, a matter that doesn\u2019t concern you because you Christian disbelief and paganism separate between religion and state, thereby granting supreme authority to your whims and desires via the legislators you vote into power.\"\n\n> **3. Because some of you are atheist**\n\n> \"In the case of the atheist fringe, we hate you and wage war against you because you disbelieve in the existence of your Lord and Creator.\"\n\n> **4. For your crimes against Islam**\n\n> \"We hate you for your crimes against Islam and wage war against you to punish you for your transgressions against our religion.\"\n\n> **5. For your crimes against Muslims**\n\n> \"We hate you for your crimes against the Muslims; your drones and fighter jets bomb, kill, and maim our people around the world, and your puppets in the usurped lands of the Muslims oppress, torture, and wage war against anyone who calls to the truth.\"\n\n> **6.

As long as there is an inch of territory left for us to reclaim, jihad will continue to be a personal obligation on every single Muslim.\"\n\n> **What\u2019s important to understand here is that although some might argue that your foreign policies are the extent of what drives our hatred, this particular reason for hating you is secondary, hence the reason we addressed it at the end of the above list.**\n\n> **\"The fact is, even if you were to stop bombing us, imprisoning us, torturing us, vilifying us, and usurping our lands, we would continue to hate you because our primary reason for hating you will not cease to exist until you embrace Islam.\"**",

You can be a neutral country and still get hit by Muslim terrorists...if you allow the creation of large muslim communities. And you can be an interventionist country like Poland and not get hit, if you don't allow such and refuse refugee quotas as they do. It's quite simple really yet the ideological agenda of the left to fill Europe with people from Africa and Asia just can't accept this obvious correlation, as it would go against its project of \"diversifying\" Europe with as many people from outside as possible. \n\nThe Manchester girls thank you all for the lovely \"diversity\".

    "body": "Well just a little something we should all think about before Trump and the Jewish influence, that pushed us  into Iraq, tries to sell a war with Iran to us.\n\nWhy is Iran so important?\n\nThe question is actually quite a complex one that goes all the way back to the time of [T.E Lawrence and the Arab revolt](http://www.historynet.com/creating-chaos-lawrence-of-arabia-and-the-1916-arab-revolt.htm) and the consequent alliances that have naturally developed from that time.\n\nThe situation in the Middle East is multi-faceted and is similar to the Syria crisis with overlapping alliances and the unfortunate necessary backing of often brutal dictators.\n\nI see the Middle Eastern conflict as split into two causes, the conflict that occurs between Jerusalem and the Arab world and then the rise of radical islamic terrorism that has affected us. The two situations overlap but are not the same. \n\nWhen it comes to the rise of radicalism throughout Europe and the West we need to look no further than Saudi Arabia to see how they are actively supporting and exporting radical theology that is leading to radicalization throughout the west. This is nearly an exclusively Sunni/Salafist/Wahabbi problem as there have been zero attacks by proxies of Shiite muslims on Western nations or by those who have been radicallized in their mosques. In fact, Iranians are the most assimiable muslim groups to be in Europe at the moment.\n\nFollowing, are links that illustrate my assertion.\n\n[Link 1](http://www.dw.com/en/germany-needs-to-respond-to-state-sponsored-salafism-experts-say/a-36753159)\n[Link 2](http://www.dw.com/en/brussels-great-mosque-and-ties-with-salafism/a-18866998)\n[Link 3](https://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/terrorist-sponsors-saudi-arabia-pakistan-china)\n[Link 4](http://www.dw.com/en/police-raid-hildesheim-mosque-arrest-ludwigsburg-suspect/a-19431297)\n[Link 5](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/26/world/middleeast/saudi-arabia-islam.html?mcubz=0&_r=0)\n[Link 6](https://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/terrorist-sponsors-saudi-arabia-pakistan-china)\n\nHowever, as I said the situation in the Middle East and there is the issue of Israel. Basically, Iran supports Hezbollah and Hezbollah and Mossad/IDF are playing tit for tat and as long as that is going on the Americans will take the side of any group that is opposing Hezbollah/Iran. Taking that the US has historic ties to Saudi Arabia and the Jewish state, we can easily see why Iran is the \"great evil\" of our day.",

Bush may think that a war against Iraq is the solution to our problems, but the reality is, it will only serve to create far more.\n\n> This war will not put an end to anti-Americanism; it will fan the flames of hatred even higher. It will not end the threat of weapons of mass destruction; it will make possible their further proliferation. And it will not lay the groundwork for the flourishing of democracy throughout the Mideast; it will harden the resolve of Arab states to drive out all Western (i.e. U.S.) influence.\n\n> If you thought Osama bin Laden was bad, just wait until the countless children who become orphaned by U.S. bombs in the coming weeks are all grown up. Do you think they will forget what country dropped the bombs that killed their parents? In 10 or 15 years, we will look back fondly on the days when there were only a few thousand Middle Easterners dedicated to destroying the U.S. and willing to die for the fundamentalist cause. From this war, a million bin Ladens will bloom.\n\n> And what exactly is our endgame here? Do we really believe that we can install Gen. Tommy Franks as the ruler of Iraq? Is our arrogance and hubris so great that we actually believe that a U.S. provisional military regime will be welcomed with open arms by the Iraqi people? Democracy cannot possibly thrive under coercion. To take over a country and impose one's own system of government without regard for the people of that country is the very antithesis of democracy. And it is doomed to fail.\n\n> A war against Iraq is not only morally wrong, it will be an unmitigated disaster.",

This has created safe areas where people with terrorist inclinations can go and train and get public reinforcement for their ideology, as well as giving them the platform to preach to the local population and control over local economy, taxation etc. that helps them to further spread.\n\nUK and US foreign policy has caused a lot of issues for everybody.

There are buddhist monks slaughtering hindus and christians in Indonesia; there are terror groups operating around the world for myriad different reasons and not one of them can be put down to a sole cause - this is not because of \"british foreign policy\" alone; it's not because of \"muslims and sharia law\"; it's not because of anyone thing, but multiple complicated reasons. Individual, local, national and global forces all have an impact. And yet, because this is the complicated nature of things like this, it's easier for people to be derivative about the causes and assign them as simplistic things. \n\nTo have any leading political figure making the point that these events must be viewed with nuance and careful thought is refreshing, to say the least.

The need for a jewish state post WW2 was clear, but you can hardly expect to introduce a brand new well-funded and well-armed country into the region without causing issues. That's not to say that the arab nations are devoid of blame for their actions, but we've hardly helped the matter. The claim here is not that we've gone to war there so they're coming here to do the same, but that we're helping to create an environment that is a hotbed for extremism and anti-western hate.   \n\nIt's a complex issue and there are many contributing factors, the agency of these people is of course undeniable, but to ignore that our actions in the middle east have contributed to the issue is either shortsighted or willful ignorance.
