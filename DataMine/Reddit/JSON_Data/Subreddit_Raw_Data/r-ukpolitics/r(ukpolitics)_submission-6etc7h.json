The voters of South Thanet will cast their own judgement. It's really wrong. The Electoral Commission concluded that the Conservatives probably overspent by millions in the last election. The maximum they could fine them was \u00a370k. They also complained that they were blocked and obstructed by the Party while they were conducting their investigation. \n\nIn declining to charge the other MP's with electoral fraud, the CPS was explicit in stating that there was not enough evidence to bring criminal charges against individual people. That is very different to saying that there is no evidence at all. In other words, a political party can essentially 'buy' democracy, and the maximum sanction will be a \u00a370k fine. It stinks. The Tories only won a majority of 12 seats in 2015. Take a moment to think about how much different the UK would be if just six of those seats were swayed by all that money. Seriously. Think about it. Then get angry.\"",

The expenditure on the buses was declared by the Conservative Party on its national declaration of \"Campaign Spending\", but in some cases the hotel accommodation was not declared at all as election spending when it should have been. In addition, there is controversy about whether the expenditure, both on the buses and the accommodation, should have been declared on the declarations of expenditure for the constituency made by each candidate's\u00a0election agent.\u00a0Kent Police\u00a0began an investigation into the spending returns of Mackinlay following the\u00a0Channel 4\u00a0report.\n\nConservative supporters are trying to sweep it under the rug by chalking this up to bad local bookkeeping.

They won the seat by a relatively slim margin (about 2000 votes in an electorate of 67000 people) amidst claims of foul play by UKIP - initially over shady dealings with vote counting, but latterly regarding expenses.\n\nIronically, in the end exactly what they didn't want to happen (Farage giving exposure to the campaign to leave the EU and UKIP receiving the domestic exposure they needed to force a referendum) came about because of David Cameron's silly gamble, and all their money was wasted, because the UK voted to leave anyway.",

    "body": "It started as a Channel 4 investigation which led to 29 Tory MPs being wrapped up in a further investigation carried out by the Electoral Commision, which looked into whether Conservative Campaigns fudged their election expenses in the 2015 general election or not. \n\nWe were due to find out whether any MP's were going to be charged with regards to these allegations recently, and the CPS said there was not sufficient evidence to seek prosecution in all cases (14 police forces submitted cases) except for one from Kent police (the OP).\n\nThe reason that these investigations might have pushed Theresa May to calling an early election, is because the Conservatives working majority is 12, so if we were to have by-elections called from MP's being prosecuted, it could have removed the Tory majority and forced an election anyway. So one more reason it was better for Theresa May and the Conservatives to have an election now because then the results from 2015 effectively don't matter (with regards to who's keeping their seat).\n\nHere's Channel 4's website for more detail: http://www.electionexpenses.co.uk/",

I'm not popular, so that's only like... 4 people, but it's still 4 more votes than they'd have gotten since it seems like a lot of 18-30 year olds aren't even registered to vote yet -_-\n\n\n\n\nI'm hoping the recent awful coverage May has gotten on ITV and the BBC (compared to Corbyn, who seems to have had a lot of fashion and PR advice given his way lately. Corbyn of 2016 compared to right now is a 180 pre-brexit in terms of likability and image on the silver screen) may have convinced enough people to vote anybody other than conservatives and UKIP, since all other parties seem to prefer labour to the torys. hah\n\n\n\n\n\n\nit's funny though... I'm so use to last year and the American election. our election \"cycle\" is so short. I feel like we're in a Hillary vs Bernie sort of debacle, but it'll end too soon instead of going on for half a year at a minimum. I know it's a snap election, but even the pre-planned ones are a bit of a bore compared to the Americans.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI have definately heard a lot more tory hate lately in Manchester/Salford than before. even my mum who never votes (other than remain, to be fair. but that's because I hounded her about the UK's future) in a conservative stronghold that voted to leave has said that she's voting Corbyn, which shocked me. she even has a \"vote labour\" sign outside her house. she's what I consider the \"average voter\" in the retired 60+ demographic... i.e. uses technology but doesn't inhabit anywhere other than facebook, doesn't care about politics too much, and watches TV all fucking day from jeremy kyle to that thing about benefit cheats. has a dim outview when it comes to \"people on benefits\", all that good stuff. but yeah, she's still voting Corbyn because she sees May as Thatcher 2.0, but with an incompetence downgrade. \n\n\n\n\n\nmy dad's not voting, but would vote green or write in superman as the PM. something dumb. he hates politics and thinks that they're all the same ",

Before the last election our MP was the Tory Laura Sandys, I can say for certain she was not elected because she was Tory. \n\n\nThanet is rife with problems, we have one of the most corrupt local councils in the country, there was a point where Margate had the highest teenage pregnancy rates in Europe, environmental issues (live exports out of Ramsgate harbour, pollution in Pegwell bay from the old Phizer plant), we are only just getting our first Wetherspoons this June because a Thanet based pub magnate has had the influence on the coucil to block every attempt of theirs to set up here, and the list goes on and on and on. \n\n\nLaura Sandys actually embraced these issues and lobbied on our behalf to do something about them, not that much even got done but that's beside the point. Before that we had a Labour MP, Steve Ladyman, for the entire New Labour period, and likewise his popularity stemmed from his embrace of the local issues. I believe it was not a coincidence that his failure to retain his seat coincided with his ascension up the party ranks (he peaked at transport secretary inc. an appearance on Top Gear) and his diminished focus on local issues. \n\n\nMy point is that, I know these people well (because I am one), and to be honest whilst they are a bit racist and not that wild about immigration, they vote for the people that are going to sort shit out at home first before they even consider party lines and political ideologies.

The run-off round often mandates dropping all parties with % vote lower than a certain value, e.g 12.5%. People who support minority parties essentially lose their vote. It also makes the voting process longer, more complicated, and more vulnerable to strategic voting.\n\nPersonally I would much prefer a ranked elimination voting system. e.g. where you can rank as many parties as you wish from your most favourite to least. Assign the votes according to each voter's top pick for party, eliminate the party with the smallest vote, then reassign the votes for the eliminated to party to the next preference. Repeat until only 1 party is left.\n\nEveryone's vote would count. The resulting party would represent a compromise of the entire public's voting preferences - no ones vote would be discarded (provided you ranked all running parties) due to fractious party lines like we see in fptp.\n\n",
