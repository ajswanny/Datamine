Indeed, setting high expectations for primary kids makes sense - they're capable of incredible things. Teach them while we can, before they get derailed by puberty.  \n\nGove also destroyed Boris Johnson's chance of being prime minister. That almost qualifies him as a national hero, in my book.",

It seems like it's common knowledge that \"neonics kill bees\" - there's plenty of petitions calling for their usage to be banned. It must be well-founded, properly tested, scientific fact; right?\n\nIn the linked article, to back up the statement \"neonicotinoids damage bee populations\" the Guardian links back to one of its own articles from 4 months ago, here: https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jun/29/pesticides-damage-survival-of-bee-colonies-landmark-study-shows\n\nIn this article, they acknowledge that \"there had been few realistic field studies to date to address the role of the insecticides and only occasional evidence for colony-level harm in wild bees.\" This agrees with the new research they link to,\n (http://science.sciencemag.org/content/356/6345/1393.full), which states that:\n\n> \"However, lingering criticism was that the [earlier studies] did not represent field-realistic levels of the chemicals or prevailing environmental conditions.\"\n\nThe researchers found that:\n\n> \"Neonicotinoid exposure resulted in both negative (Hungary and United Kingdom) and positive (Germany) effects on colony size (see Fig. 2; pairwise treatment comparison given in tables S4 and S5). Bombus terrestris worker and peak colony weight showed no seed treatment response\"\n\nThey concluded with:\n\n> \"our results suggest that exposure to neonicotinoid seed treatments can have negative effects on the interannual reproductive potential of both wild and managed bees, but that these effects are not consistent across countries\"\n\nHere is their graph: \nhttps://d2ufo47lrtsv5s.cloudfront.net/content/sci/356/6345/1393/F3.large.jpg?width=800&height=600&carousel=1\n\nDo the lines really match up with the data points? Particularly for the UK? To me it seems like the research is attempting to use noisy data to confirm the theory that \"the effects of neonicotinoids are a product of interacting factors\" in order to agree with a hypothesis drawn from flawed earlier research.\n\nThis \"smoking gun\" appears to be weak correlation at best. If anybody could link me to better studies, please send them over.",

Statistics meaning more than than any individual, one example was when one of my parents was put into a meeting because one of her kids with learning difficulties wasn't hitting the targets they needed to hit. This target being the same for the kids without learning difficulties. This tied into performance related pay (if the students hit targets set pay went up) which is easy to do if you have a class of the brightest students but far more challenging in an understaffed class with students who have learning difficulties, made Gove the target for a lot of teachers anger.\n\nTl;Dr - Gove created an atmosphere where data seemed to matter more than students.\n\n",

As someone in year 11 right now I can tell you there quite are a few problems with the reformed GCSEs. For example in English, the only texts we are allowed to study and complete an exam with are ones written by people from the UK meaning some incredible literature such as 'To Kill a Mockingbird' and 'Of Mice and Men'. There are lots of annoying things like this in the new GCSEs and probably the worst part of it all is that they have completely abolished coursework for most written subjects (obviously things like Music and Drama sill have some stil but in most, there is absolutely none). This means that grades for our subjects are very dependant on a few days at the end of year when we will probably be absolutely shattered and possibly have some unlucky days which will not be propped up by coursework meaning some may not get the grades they desrved or were predicted but thats just my view on things- Im sure this way of working suits some people and I'm happy with the interesting new content added to most GCSEs.",

Neonicotinoids have almost a hallucinogenic effect on honey bees, in that it basically makes them unable to navigate and can be shared through bee saliva through trophylaxis, meaning that limited exposure can spread this effect like a disease throughout the hive.\n\nSadly, there's much we don't know about CCD. Everything is theoretical at the moment. The problem with CCD is that it's so sudden, it's practically impossible to have measuring devices ready to measure.....and that leads me to the second problem in that we don't know what to measure. And furthermore, you can't induce it, as that would lead to you saying that this artificial extreme we manufactured caused it, when there might be mitigating factors in another hive, in the same way that we'd worry far more about flu in the absence of medical treatment. \n\nNow I work mostly with ants, but with all Hymenoptera, they're so alien to us and break most of the rules of animal behaviour (eg. most animals won't fight to the death due to self preservation. Hymenoptera (and some Blattoidia termites) will gladly commit suicide to protect others.), that it's extremely difficult to recognise behavioural patterns, especially since you're dealing with thousands of individuals. \n\nI will say though, there is evidence to suggest that neonicotinoids might not be the cause (and kudos for digging it up), although most entomologists are still of the opinion that it's at the very least, a contributing factor.",

Teachers hated it when John Major's government introduced league tables for schools in 1992, for instance. \n\nYou can reasonably argue it either way - teachers are right that it's unfair to compare a school in Oxford, where everyone's parents are professors, to a school in Tower Hamlets. But at the same time, we surely need to measure relative performance to see which schools need more resources, and who are the best teachers. \n\nIt's worth noting that although the Tories introduced league tables, Labour [never got rid of them] (http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/6257063.stm). So I'm not sure how much can be laid at Gove's door specifically - the push towards metrics has been going on for decades. ",

'East of Eden' and 'The Grapes of Wrath' are also very much worth it. \n\nHowever, those novels are important to Americans because they offer a vivid commentary on 20th Century US history. I think I agree with Gove that, being British, we should attempt to understand our own culture before we start obsessing about the USA, which has a very different history that we tend to hear lots about anyway, due to Hollywood. \n\nThere are some great British novels from the same era. Animal Farm, although it's secretly about Russia, is a brilliant way of understanding how George Orwell, one of our greatest thinkers and a socialist, viewed what happened in the Soviet Union. Of more recent writing, I'd suggest Kazuo Ishiguro too - a living British Nobel Prize laureate whose novels are actually an easy read. \n\n",

Mass trapping, where you make a bait station or some sort of sticky trap, and attract the makes with the same principles as above, removing them from the gene pool.\n\n3. Bait stations where you catch the ladies before they lay the eggs by lacing it with a nutrient they need in egg development, but also use a toxic pesticide without spraying it on the crops.\n\n3. There's some live culture things which can help plants defend themselves against insects better. \n\nThe trick is to use an integrated approach to use the biology of the insect against itself. If you use chemicals they rely on for communication you can suppress the population effectively. Even if you continue to use spray pesticides it massively reduces the quantity needed to control the population. \n\nI would also say we need more wild flowers about.

Mitsubishi in Japan and a couple of US companies also are testing big storage capacity batteries too (TRL 6-7 stuff). The operability of smart grids is increasing feasible.\n\n2 - What I mention above only offers half of the solution. Even if we can or can't build these batteries other storage systems exist. Chemical storage is increasingly feasible (affordable, we have a lot of the tech already although a new generation of catalysts is under development for increased yields), we can store renewable energy as hydrogen (gaseous or as a hydride in metal), or we can store it in other simple molecules like methanol, ethanol, DME or formic acid (the latter needs better fuel cell tech though). You cab then combust these much more cleanly than longer chain hydrocarbons. Carbon sources are tricky but direct air capture is increasingly feasible too. Hydrogen production is tied to electrolysis which is already seeing huge drops in operating costs and will likely be as cheap as methane reformation by 2040. We already have vehicles that run on DME, H2 and ethanol.\n\nBy all means by cynical, it keeps those that work in the field honest and determined but we are making huge strides in many directions. The problems are still there for now but even compared to 10 years ago the energy picture has changed significantly - huge rise in wind power in the UK, Drax is half biomass fired, all coal to be gone in a decade - these are huge changes in a short time.",

I take the position that predictions will sometimes be wrong- or at least will not be adequately captured by a single point estimate but by a prediction interval- but still more useful than not. This is a nuanced position.\n\nGove offers the advice that experts are wrong, this means that they are not worth listening to, and then rabble rouses because they work for institutions with acronyms. The fact that people defend this position based on the fact that prediction is complicated and sometimes approximate annoys me. ",
