S/he went about calculating how many flats there were in tower block, worked out how many flats there were per floor (recall it being 5) and a rough estimate about the minimum number of people living per flat. From there they went onto say how the fire dept. didn't reach above floor 12 or 13 leaving ~10 floors or something. From there they worked backwards, [10 x 5 x (3 to 5)] which gives you a result of anything between 150 and 250 people. \n\n**Edit2: I was paraphrasing, just because it was all a strange coincidence. Slipped my mind and the last thing I would like is to spread misinformation especially 'back-of-the-envelope' made up figures! Victim count was around 80 or so, ~250 survivors.**\n\n(Just typing that out left a 'funny empty' sort of feeling in my tummy; feels like my heart just sank). \n\n\nMay all those that died, Grenfell or any other tragedy, rest in peace. \n\nEdit: Googled 'tower blocks' ~~because I forgot what they were called~~ and some of the latest headlines are as follows\n\n02.10.17: [Fire risk reports for Norwich council tower blocks revealed](http://www.edp24.co.uk/news/norwich-tower-block-fire-risk-assessments-1-5218025)\n\n03.10.17: [Portsmouth tower blocks cladding removal date set](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-hampshire-41485607)\n\n05.10.17: [Glasgow tower blocks to get new tests after 'Grenfell-style' cladding found](http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/glasgow-tower-blocks-new-tests-11294938)\n\n08.10.17: ['Grenfell-style' cladding at Glasgow tower blocks to be tested](http://www.glasgowlive.co.uk/news/glasgow-news/grenfell-style-cladding-glasgow-tower-13731979)\n",

Every window for probably a half mile was shattered onto the streets below. Multiple buildings had collapsed inwards towards to bomb and the few weeks after that a lot of people visibly avoided walking near any parked vehicle. \n\nNo one actually died in this incident, which is crazy in itself - a 450kg bomb going off and only 6 injured.\n\n4 March 1992: A Catholic civilian, James Gray (39), was shot dead by the UVF while driving his lorry at Cornascreeb.\n\nI'd like to point out that many of these civilian murders were similar in nature. You'd be driving home from work, a bunch of men would stop your car and ask you a pretty simple question \"Are you catholic or protestant?\" and your answer would determine whether you lived or died.\n\n29 March 1992: A Catholic civilian, Terence McConville (43), was shot dead by the UVF at his home on Bann Street.\n\n19 November 1992: An off-duty British soldier, Ian Warnock (27), was shot dead by the IRA while sitting in his car outside the Moypark factory near Portadown.\n\nAnd this is just a few from my relatively small town in an area relatively unaffected by the Troubles. If you want the real shit, look at Belfast.\n\nIslamic terrorism, at least here in Northern Ireland, is no concern at all. Slightly above that is troubles related terrorism, which still is no concern here in 2017.\n\nBut to all the people that laugh and shout nonsense like \"you're more likely to die from stairs than Islamic terrorism\" (as if stairs are malicious and planning to increase their numbers) well, you should feel lucky you've never had to live through a period of time where people are murdered on your home street, outside your place of work, so you can sit on your macbook in starbucks and educate us all on how ignorant we are :D",

Because of the IRA. \n\nDoes it hurt you that much that you terrorism was so much worse back then and wasn't committed by Muslims. So you care more who did it than who the victims were?\n\n",

While I am for a better control of refugees (force education of German standards, language etc. for the refugees who actually want to stay here, check personal ID etc. before letting them in and so on), we don't have any problem with them. Their country is getting bombed after all, letting them in temporarily(I know most of them will stay!

And in Europe with Spain reaching a ceasefire with its seperatists, terrorism was at an all time low.\n\nBut this new threat, that is less likely to kill the average Briton than bathtubs, sharks and dodgy takeouts? Multi-billion pounds needed over decades.\n\nThe change was so stark and highlighted what a real threat is vs what is a propaganda threat. During the troubles, the response to terrorism was to keep working, ignore it, don't let it affect you. Trying to convince people not to be scared of post boxes. In contrast the War on Terror gave us Terror Threat Level meter which will forever remain on high despite living in then safest times in history.\n\nThe worst part is that it worked. The media swarms at any suggestion of terrorism. Everything is blown out of proportion. This sub alone spends so much time devoted to talking about terrorism even though it almost never happens. If the past year have shown us anything it's that all a nutter needs is a car. And yet pretty much everyone in 70 million chooses not to.\n\nNo one knows just how peaceful things are now because no one remembers what regular terror was actually like.",

Sort of correct but not actually correct and lacks any nuance whatsoever.\n\nThe IRA was, broadly speaking, an organisation that sought to bring about a United Ireland. However, the IRA operated in a cell structure, and relatively professionally compared to modern day terror cells. The organisation wasn't directed by a single person.\n\nThe IRA needed funding to buy weapons and explosives, and it needed illegal contacts to buy said weapons. In order to make these connections and make this money, inevitably a large part of IRA activities were little more than organised crime. Protection rackets, robberies, drug dealing, arms dealing, pretty much any organised illegal activity you can think of, funneled money into the IRA (along with donations from witless Americans).\n\nIt was similar on the Loyalist side. The Paramilitary organisations fighting \"against the IRA\" needed illicit funds and weapons too, and often engaged in illegal activities in order to fund their activities.\n\nSo when you have an \"IRA\" drug dealer killing a \"non-IRA\" drug dealer for basically the same reasons any normal drug dealer would kill another (e.g. Because they won't stay off their patch) it becomes an IRA killing.\n\nThis is why after the Good Friday Agreement was signed, while a lot of the IRA and Loyalists put down their weapons and stopped, there were lots of splinter factions. This wasn't because they were \"continuing the good fight\" (because if you noticed the terror attacks stopped) but because they were being ran by individuals who had built a life running criminal organisations, and had no desire to go legit. Did they ever care about a united Ireland? Who can say, but we know that it wasn't their primary motivator. ",

The IRA are famous for 'shame/maim' tactics in these instances and widely condemned drug dealing, as it was (no longer is) tied heavily to loyalist connections at the docks, not forgetting that Catholics could not work in these areas. That's not to say that they could control everyone or supply from the South, but those who were caught were almost definitely tarred and feathered or kneecapped. It's important to describe *which* IRA you mean. In terms of the Provisional IRA, an anti-drug stance is at the centre of their ideology. To purchase drugs as a catholic in Belfast in the past would likely go to fund people who would murder you, your family or your neighbours. This was widely known and punishment beatings for similar transgressions continue to this day. \n\nThe INLA are the most widely known republican terrorist group that sell drugs, but membership has never been high and generally existed as a minor group in mostly protestant towns, far from the centres of control of the PIRA. \n\n A lot of deaths and shootouts with the army occurred in South Armagh at the border, far away from any centre of population. \n\nMurders from the CAIN index are also retroactively analysed for political motivation and sectarianism, so I don't know where you're getting this from. \n\n",

    "body": "Very, VERY long and complicated story. \n\nBut the short version is that some people wanted Northern Ireland to cease being part of the UK and join the Republic of Ireland. Many of these people used religion as a justification, since the UK is a mostly Protestant country with an established Protestant church, whereas the Republic of Ireland is a mostly catholic country with Catholicism in its constitution, \n\nSome of these people formed the Irish Republican Army, or IRA, and for three decades between the early seventies and late nineties, the IRA engaged in terrorist attacks against British civilians, British police, and British soldiers, both in Northern Ireland and on the mainland UK. \n\nThe British government often responded with extreme and disproportionate force, as well as crackdowns on civil liberties and discrimination against Irish people living in the U.K. \n\nThis whole era was known as the Troubles, and it ended with a peace accord known as the Good Friday Agreement. \n\nEDIT: So, this comment has really ~~blown up~~ attracted a lot of attention. Instead of responding to everyone individually, I just wanted to make a couple of observations here. First, I am well aware that this is an enormous oversimplification of a very complicated situation, and therefore it leaves out quite a lot of important background. I did that deliberately, to give the original American questioner a very short summary, instead of a thesis on 800 years of history. If I omitted something you consider important, it was in the interests of brevity and clarity, not ideological obfuscation. Secondly, I have received a great many replies to the effect that I am being biased or one-sided in presenting the issue. Amusingly (to me, anyway), these are divided almost equally between people who think I am being unfair to the Irish/Catholics/Republicans by ignoring their oppression at the hands of the British, and those who think I am being unfair to the British/Protestants/Unionists by downplaying or justifying acts of terrorism. Let me be clear: my intention was to do neither. I have no desire to pick \"sides\" in this conflict, not to advocate for one point of view or another. I am not ethnically British or ethnically Irish. I am neither Catholic nor Protestant. Put simply, I have no dog in this fight, and I accept that there are many valid and arguable interpretations of history. I simply wanted to give a helpful, factual, and unbiased answer to someone unfamiliar with the issue. ",

    "body": "So most of these replies have been extremely biased in 1 direction so lets go the other. You can't understand the IRA and the north without understanding Ireland's history under British rule.\n\nIreland was ruled by Britain for centuries and the native population were not treated kindly during that time to say the least. Rebellions were common and multiple attempts were made to quieten the local populace. Plantations were attempted across the country where local Catholics would be displaced from their lands and Protestants and Presbyterians from Britain would be shipped over. The only place this was successful was the plantation of ulster. The only oher protestant stronghold was in Dublin which was the centre of British rule in Ireland\n\nNative Catholics (the vast majority of the country) were subjugated by a largely British protestant ascendancy. Penal laws banned the teaching of the Irish language in schools and prevented native Catholics from holding public office, voting, owning weapons so serving in the army, being lawyers or judges, acquiring land and more. They even prevented comfortable inheritance. If a catholic man died their land had to be equally split amongst his sons unless one converted to Protestantism which few did. This policy ultimately created the conditions that led to the famine where plots were so small the only land available to grow food for themselves rather than pay rent could only sustain a family if it was a staple food like potatos. When the potato crop failed due to blight, gross negligence from the ruling British saw a million people starve to death as food continued to be exported en mass from the country. This tragedy almost exclusively affected native catholic Irish. \n\nFollowing on from this came a series of nationalist movements which aimed to restore the culture and language of the Irish people that had been almost eradicated by Protestant Britian's intentional suppression and by the devestation of the famine. The Gaelic League (Conradh na Gaelige) promoted the Irish language while the GAA were founded to revive the traditional Irish sports of Hurling and Gaelic Football. This nationalist cultural revivial combined with a long standing desire for home rule which had been denied repeatedly by the british established and fiercely opposed by the ascendant Irish Protestant minority. A failed rebellion in 1916 without much popular support saw the perpetrators brutally executed by the British galvanising the country around the nationalist movement now seeking full independence. The 1918 general election saw the new nationalist party Sinn F\u00e9in win a huge majority winning 73 of Irelands 105 seats, losing only constituencies in protestant strongholds of Dublin and Ulster. This ultimately led to the Irish War of Independence.\n\nFollowing several years of guerrilla warfare the Irish Republican Army (IRA) prevailed and the British agreed to peace negotiations. During this period the British decided to partition the country artificially creating the statelet of Northern Ireland. The Irish could have their independence but not the whole country. The boundary of the partition was heavily contested despite the long standing identity of 9 county Ulster only 6 counties formed Northern Ireland as the goal was to select as large a portion of land as possible while maintaining a demographic composition that would guarantee protestant rule for a century. Protestant unionists demanded partition fearing discrimination in a Catholic dominated independent Irish state. Ultimately the peace treaty was accepted and Ireland and Northern Ireland became separate political entities. \n\nThis led to a civil war in Ireland and eventually a poor independent state struggling to find it's feet. The new state under \u00c9amon de Valera was very conservative and strongly catholic but the widespread recriminations that protestant unionists (an important distinction as many Irish nationalists were protestant) had feared never manifested. However in the North there was widespread discrimination against Catholics. Gerrymandering was used to minimise nationalist catholic political influence far below where it would have been proportionately. With total control of political institutions, industry and the police protestant unionists in the north openly discriminated against catholics, companies would refuse to employ them, they would be denied public and social housing and persecuted by the police. \n\nThis led in the 1960s to a civil rights movement seeking equal treatment for Catholic nationalists. This movement was met with fierce Protestant unionist opposition. Groups formed to oppose them including unionist paramilitary (terrorist) groups the UPV and the UVF. These groups sought to oust Terrence O'Neill the unionist leader of Northern Ireland who they felt was too soft on civil rights. Violence began when the UVF firebombed a number of catholic homes and declared war on the IRA which had remained in relevance as a consequence of the Irish Civil War and had found a home in the north supporting the civil rights movement. Civil rights protests continued throughout the late 60s and continued to be met with violent opposition. The IRA began to grow to oppose Unionist paramilitary violence feeling the police were either not preventing or in some cases actively participating in the violence against the Catholics. Unionist paramilitaries began bombings on power and water infrastructure blaming the attacks on the IRA hoping the bombings would force O'Neill to end support for concessions to Catholics.\n\nViolence escalated, protests became riots at the police began violent crackdowns in conjunction with unionist groups. A schism within the IRA saw the formation of the offical IRA which backed non violent civil unrest and the Provisional IRA committed to an armed struggle against the British. In 1972 a protest in Derry resulted in the murder of 14 unarmed civilians by the British Army. \"Bloody Sunday\" massively escalated the conflict galvanizing the Catholic nationalist community not just against their local oppressors but against the wider British institution, the movement stopped being about gaining civil rights and about reunifying the country. The PIRA began to target the British military members and infrastructure as well as paramiltary targets, the OIRA militarized in turn, Unionist violence continued against the Catholic communities. IRA factions occasionally moved the conflict outside of the north attacking targets on the UK mainland. British troops surged into the north and violence continued throughout the following decades with British army forced colluding with unionist paramilitaries. Eventually a lengthy negotiation process resulted in the Good Friday Agreement in the late 90s the largely brought an end to the conflict. ",

Later it was tried again (I believe under HH Asquith, who was also a Liberal) these times it failed in the House of Lords. This went on until 1911 when the Parliament Act was passed, this meant the House of Commons was stronger than the Lords. The Irish Home Rule Act was passed in 1914, but due to a wee war called The Great War it was suspended in the Suspension Act, along with the Welsh Church Act. Between 1885-1916 anger had been growing over the lack of progress, and other social issues, and so on Easter Sunday 1916 the Irish Volunteers, and some other paramilitaries declared the Provisional Irish Republic, this was mostly kept to a few government buildings in Dublin and minor skirmishes in the countryside and lasted 5 days before being crushed by the British Army. This was the largest uprising since 1798.  Then in 1918 the paramilitaries had most joined the Irish Republican Army who again started a civil war which was fought mainly in Munster, Dublin and Belfast and lasted 2 and a half years. Following this Ireland was divided in two and the IRA were victorious. However a fair portion of the IRA didn\u2019t like the treaty, they wanted all of Ireland so a split happened the pro treaty IRA became the National Army and the anti treaty renamed the IRA, the National Army beat the IRA. The IRA carried on fighting both the British and Irish, for example.  \n1939 Bombing Campaign killed 10 in Coventry.  \n1942-1944 Northern Campaign, anger over the presence of US troops in Northern Ireland the IRA fought again, mostly in Northern Ireland and the border. They lost.  \n1956-1962 Border Campaign, fought on the Northern Irish side of the border mostly it was another defeat for the IRA. The IRA were no longer allowed to attack Ireland now though, following the formation of the Republic.  \n1968-1998 The Troubles, the last major operation by the IRA (who splintered in this time to, the main IRA was the Provisional IRA). This was caused from civil rights issues, like legal discrimination of Catholic(Irish) by Protestant (Ulster-Scot).  \n  \nThe IRAs used guerrilla warfare and planted bombs, mostly for destruction. They used to call the police and say one of the code words inform the police they have a bomb in location X so the police can evacuate people before it goes off. They didn\u2019t always do this and sometimes it went wrong, they say it was at the other end of the street for example. ",

    "body": "That response seems to be leaning toward British perspective and paint the IRA as true terrorists without any true justification other than wanting separation due to Religion.\n\nIreland had fought for independence a 100 years before which resulted in the majority of Ireland became Republic while 6 counties in the North remained apart of the UK. This led to a Civil War as some thought it's the best they could get or all or nothing (Michael Collins is good film with Liam Neeson you should check out). He is right on the divide being Catholic and Protestant but it's not that their religious practices is the bother it was that the Irish Catholic were subject to a lot of discrimination beforehand of the troubles which was the cause of them not a byproduct. The British police and forces would commit just as bad as atrocities and are considered just as much terrorists from the IRA perspective as the world considers the IRA. Not like the jihadists were it's one sided",

The spread of violence was largely in northern ireland but a fair amount of it happened in London/England too. I read once at one point they had a .50 cal sniper rifle that they fired from a land rover converted to carry it comfortably inside, shot a lot of British soldiers.\n\n Anyway all this shit happened up until this thing called the good friday agreement where the IRA agreed to stop terroristing and the British agreed to stop hunting them. An unpopular stipulation was that IRA members couldnt be tried for crimes committed before the agreement but British soldiers could. The G.F.A. results in the huge downturn in deaths.\n\nFun personal anecdote, my mum got knocked over by a Prov IRA carbomb blast when she was younger. You'll never meet a woman more open and tolerant to refugees but she opened a bottle of Champagne when Martin McGuinness died\n\nEdit: Gonna throw a cheeky edit in, the amnesty applied, according to Tony Blair was an attempt to 'end terrorism not further it', and would apply to Prov and Loyalist persons. Anyone accused of commiting a crime could apply to a commision which determined whether or not they would recieve a special trial. If found guilty, you'd get a criminal record but no jail time\n\nCouple of sources\n\nhttps://peaceaccords.nd.edu/provision/prisoner-release-northern-ireland-good-friday-agreement\n\nhttps://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/amp.theguardian.com/uk/2005/nov/10/northernireland.northernireland1\n\nhttps://www.google.co.uk/amp/www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/12/08/british-troops-investigated-killings-troubles-northern-ireland/amp/ (yeah yeah i dont like the telegraph either)",

The increased performance of the police and intelligence services along with community initiatives and awareness have forced Islamic terror to resort to brainwashing lone wolves online and convincing them to carry out spontaneous and usually not well planned attacks with little resources.\n\nThis is why now our biggest realistic worry is someone running over people with a car and stabbing them with a knife, or a very shakily home made bomb.

    "body": "First up, FakeDjinn that's a pretty decent explainer in layman terms and gives a quick overview of the situation to an outsider. My experience is it's a rather thankless task, and near impossible to try to explain it to folk without critics jumping in with \"whatabouteries\" and accusing you of bias from one side or another. As such, it's often necessary to tediously fill the explanation with disclaimers, and make obvious statements such as \"I'm just simplifying things here\" or \"I don't condone terrorism\"or \"I condemn violence\" to protect oneself from critics waiting to pounce with their outrage and strawmen, \u00e0 la \"SO YOU'RE BASICALLY SAYING IT'S OK TO KILL PEOPLE???!!!\" \n\nIf I may add a few points:\n- The NICRA (civil rights movement) achieved a lot in a few years of peaceful protests and yet their role is often overlooked by history. A key flaw in the republican strategy, in my view, was the IRA jumping on the NICRA momentum and hijacking the movement for its own gains.  The IRA enjoyed the short-term benefit of a surge in support, but in the long-term, conceded the moral high ground by shifting the focus of the movement to violent means.\n\n- Generally speaking, republicans and Sinn Fein are more PR-savvy than unionists. In my opinion, they have better outreach and are more clever when it comes to gaining support from abroad and pushing their narrative. At the same time, unionism doesn't make as much of an effort to counter these claims or provide as much balance.  As a result of long-term steady pressure, there has been what I interpret as gradual revisionism of history on the republican side. Read a few pages of any Tim Pat Coogan book to see what I mean. Republicans also make good use of creating their own mythology, and can spin valuable propaganda by turning dead IRA volunteers/soldiers (depending on the circumstances) into martyrs, which over time gain more and more power. Bobby Sands for example is well into his IRA martyr treatment, and Martin McGuinness's legacy is coming along nicely. I think of SF as a well organised, almost autocratic party who are very good at quickly putting out their party line of the moment (right now it's currently the word \"equality\", and so just about every issue argument is reframed as an \"equality\" issue to deflect opposition). Sinn Fein also understand the power of token gestures and PR stunts (something which unionists definitely do NOT grasp). As a result, SF run rings around the DUP/UUP by going on record as defending LGBT rights or abortion (whilst simultaneously trying not to annoy their Catholic Church support base). My point is that the republican narrative benefits from all of this and ultimately gains greater outside support.\n\n- Finally, I don't buy the line that the IRA didn't target civilians, and I counter it every time I see someone do it. Don't take my word for it -\n have a read through the CAIN database and make up your own mind.

Additionally, there were certainly legitimate gripes among the Catholic population - it was not *just* a movement for Irish unification, or even primarily so. It was mostly a reaction to the significant Catholic minority being an underclass in a society that was wholly run by Protestants and for Protestant interests.

    "body": "Nice selective outline of statistics. Next time you wanna copy and paste that crap, probably don't put in links where its easy to contest the picture you (or someone else who youve just copied and pasted with little to no effort) are trying to paint. **I'll just address the first link** because you've (or someone else) has completely destroyed the whole point of what that study showed and I imagine it'll just be the same for the rest of the links.\n\n> Muslims worldwide \n\nLmao no. A study asking 10,600 muslims in 11 countries. You do realise there are about 200 ~~muslim~~ countries in total? What about them, or do they not fit into your narrative? Sure, there's a lot more muslims that are in support of terrorists but I guarantee there's EVEN MORE that are against them.\n\n**The very link you are referring to literally is titled \"Muslim Publics Share Concerns about Extremist Groups\" subtitled with saying there is \"much diminished support for suicide bombing\"**\n\nIf you'd actually to bother looking at the links you posted rather than just copying and pasting them, you'd see that:\n\n* There is a MASSIVE DIFFERENCE between the regions e.g. senegal 75% concerned vs. indonesia split at 48%/48% vs. Turkey at 38% concerned. It's almost as if there might be other factors at work in the regions themselves that lend to these varied statistics?\n\n* The trends are decreasing from what they used to be, and general support by muslims for suicide bombers is reducing a lot. Just like americans views on gay marriage is becoming more supportive (62% in favour now vs. less than 50% and decreasing going back from 2011).\n\nThis survey was also done in countries like Palestine and Pakistan where there's extreme civil unrest and assuredly a massive feeling of hopelessness for their respective situations, where they might view any method for freedom. Im not justifying it but there's plenty of injustice that has befallen them that leads to desperate actions, or at least support for those actions. If you want, you can go to any of the subreddits like r/palestine to see actions by israeli government. No need to input any bias, there's some clear black and white videos that show what kind of situation they're in.\n\nhttp://news.gallup.com/poll/157067/views-violence.aspx which states that almost 50% of americans believe military attacks on civilians are ~~justified~~ sometimes justified. Compared to muslim americans, 78% of whom think that it is never justified (http://news.gallup.com/poll/148763/muslim-americans-no-justification-violence.aspx). That same survey also shows 89% (vs. 75% of atheists) of american muslims think individual/small group attacks targetting civilians is unjustified. These are the exact statistics that people in the east would probably use to talk about how evil and mindless the entire population of America and the west are. So how about not calling islam/ the 1.5billion muslims in general responsible for the beliefs of a very small percentage of the population.\n\nYour very first link contradicts everything you were trying to claim. Using very old surveys is unreliable so you cant gauge as much from them in all honesty, but what they do show is not in support of your views unfortunately. It literally states that muslim support for terrorist organisations has been declining in the past decade.\n\nI might add a few other points below everytime I go back because just from a brief look, **I can see so many things wrong with what youve said and posted**. Just by posting a bunch of links hoping people will just see sources and immediately believe you're right, you've set yourself up. I'll try and get back to different points later but atm ive gotta go:\n\n* Btw that holocaust link is not working because youve copied and pasted a comment from years ago without bothering to actually read anything from the links **because you're lazy.** I'm guessing its more that 34% of british muslims believe that some facts are distorted but you never know. (You definitely never know seeing as you cant even access the link)",

The potato crop failed across Europe.  Only in Ireland was there widespread starvation.  Just as it is true in Puerto Rico right now, government policy creates catastrophe out of natural disaster.  \n\nAgain, I'm not excusing murder for political purposes.
