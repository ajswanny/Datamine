    "body": "I'll try to address this;\n\n**1.) Minimum participation:**\n\nTurnout was 72.2%, which is high by UK electoral standards. Indeed 17.4 million British people voted for Brexit, that is more people than have voted for **anything** in the UK's entire history. For comparison general election turnout for the last 5 GEs was:\n\n* 2017: 68.8%\n* 2015: 66.1%\n* 2010: 65.1%\n* 2005: 61.4%\n* 2001: 59.4%\n\nIt would have been very difficult to argue the result was not informative on that basis, since much lower turnouts have determined the outcome of general elections for the better part of British history. The only countries that really enjoy consistently higher turnouts are those who have some form of compulsory voting (like Australia).\n\n**2.) Voting thresholds:**\n\nThe problem with an arbitrary voting threshold (i.e. 66% have to vote yes for it to pass) is that is creates an unstable and unsustainable political position. Imagine if 55% of people had voted to leave (i.e. a majority of the population), but the arbitrary threshold had been set at 66%. That would mean that 45% of the population (a minority) would get the result they wanted, despite losing the popular vote. In principle while this may be possible in law (since the referendum was technically only advisory) it would create an unstable situation where effectively a government would be enforcing policy against the direct democratic wishes of the population... it would be almost untenable for that government to proceed since they would know that at the next election they'd likely be punished by the population for acting against their democratic wishes.\n\nI think the message perhaps ought to be that politicians (around the world, not just in the UK) need to be very careful when exercising forms of direct democracy like this. The danger of course is that in asking the population for their opinion, they give you an opinion that you as a government didn't want and don't have the political willpower to enact. \n\nIn my opinion direct democracy (referendums) are good for determining controversial policies that cause headaches for governments but don't directly affect the overall direction of government policy... for example gay marriage/abortion/the death penalty. These are socially controversial policies but the outcome of these votes are unlikely to cause a government to collapse or have a major economic impact. Indeed shifting the \"blame\" for such policies onto the population can save the government problems since it is basically deflecting these tough moral/ethical issues onto the population themselves. Indeed it would have been interesting to see if Gay Marriage would have passed into law had it been a referendum... ironically I'm not so sure it would. \n\nIn contrast referendums are bad for policies the government is dependent on - for example Camerons government was tied to remaining in the EU, and by extension when they effectively \"lost\" the EU referendum their position became totally untenable and Cameron was forced by political necessity to resign. It is much better to achieve a mandate for radical policy reform at a general election via a manifesto, since the entire government is then entering into power on the basis of a particular policy with a mandate to enact it. The problem though with the EU referendum is that neither of the two parties that could realistically win a GE (Labour or the Conservatives) officially supported leaving... meaning the general election approach wouldn't have worked since both parties backed the status quo. \n\n**TL;DR: Although imperfect, it is hard to see how the referendum could have been done any better.**",

Well, up to your TL;DR. \n\nThe government could have copied the process used by countries where referendums are part of their political process. \n\nThe government should have appointed a select committee to draw up a white paper specifying exactly what would happen for each outcome of the referendum. Ideally there would some kind of transferable vote between several options. \n\nThen there would be a mandate for membership or otherwise of the single market, EEA/EFTA and the customs union, and for preservation or otherwise of freedom of movement. \n\nAnd there should have been serious penalties for any campaign which tries to push an advantage that isn't in the white paper.

The amount of people who voted Leave only makes sense in the context of those who voted Remain. Once you see that the difference between them is **3.89pp** it's not so spectacular. The turnout is spectacular yes, but all that means is that we know that a **very large amount of the electorate is very divided**. In addition we know that **2 of the UK's 4 constituent countries, which are the constitutional framework of the UK are against the decision**. We know that **a single city representing 12% of the population, London, voted against Leaving** as well. We also have some interesting demographic results, **75% of 18-25 year old voters are pro-Remain**. \n\nMeanwhile, in the 1975 referendum Yes/Remain achieved a 34.46pp majority with over 2/3 of all votes cast. That's a majority approaching 10 times the magnitude of Leave's majority in 2016. Not to mention it receiving the consent of all 4 constituent countries.\n\nI do agree with your second point, but more firmly it would have been better if the UK hadn't held a poorly thought out referendum which was about consolidating the conservative party rather than putting the interests of the nation first.",

The panel included two former chancellors of the Exchequer, a former governor of the Bank of England, an eminent labour market economist and a former head of the Financial Services Authority. You would think that, between them, they might know a thing or two. They concluded, evidently somewhat to their surprise, that \u201cwe have found no evidence for the argument, made by the government, business and many others, that net migration generates significant economic benefits for the existing UK population\u201d. \n\n It is very unfortunate that the public should have such a negative view of the performance of successive governments on a matter of real importance to their future. It is sometimes implied that the voters are really rather foolish on this issue, and that opposition to the present scale of immigration is less among those who have actual experience of it. But an opinion poll that MigrationWatch recently conducted found this to be quite wrong \u2013 only 11 per cent of the public thought that immigration had improved their local community. In fact, three times as many felt that immigration had changed their community for the worse.\n\nLondon is normally held up as a model for the positive power of immigration. In a Migrationwatch poll, 73 per cent of those in the capital felt that it had had a great deal or a fair amount of impact in their area \u2013 much higher than any other region. Similarly, more people in London felt that immigration had changed their community than anywhere else. But the numbers saying their area had changed for the worse outnumbered those who felt it had changed it for the better by more than 2 to 1. The balance of opinion was similarly negative in every other region apart from Scotland. And it\u2019s not just one poll: similar results were found by Searchlight, an organisation that describes itself as \u201canti-fascist\u201d, in its own survey. ",

First one group of people are against an implementation phase, and then two months later, half of each camp has shifted sides.  This applies with in the UK, and across Europe and the wider world as well.  The media turn every off the cuff remark and passing comment in to an ALL CAPS MAJOR THING, rather than seeing this as an ongoing, open conversation, that, frankly, is better had out in the open than decided behind closed doors.  If people change their view as a result of what people say when they air their view, isn't that the whole damn point of democracy?\n\nI'll be at the bar, come and get me when it's all over.

I was skeptical at the start about the timing of this, we've got huge economic issues to sort out, that have bled into health care, security, and all sorts of really important parts of our every day lives.  It's a precarious situation we're in, and we really need to put aside both our differences and party politics if we're going to get the best result.

While on one hand someone could argue that less competition mean more jobs for British people, this belies the fact that workers sell their skills to companies for less than they are worth. An employee's ultimate role for a company is generally to make them money. Without importing the skills necessary for British firms to perform in a global marketplace, it could be that by not importing the skilled workers to compete in that market place companies will be forced to downsize or even close down. Further there is strong evidence that immigrants are the primary founders of new companies in the developed world, leading to new job opportunities. Most of the research would seem to point to lower skilled jobs being the ones which are under threat, but immigration on a whole has a slightly negative to slightly positive impact on society. None of this says anything about the cultural benefits and difficulties of having a multicultural society. \n\n",

And from one overweight 2008 graduate to another I wish you well on the road to health - I know all too well how difficult it can be.\n\nSo this little chain, and my recent crusades on here along similar lines, are my attempt to inject some rationality to the proclamations of Armageddon and doom that I keep seeing crop up. There seems to be this faction of Remainers who took \"bad for the economy\" and projected it out to mean the wholesale destruction of the UK as we know it, and that's just patently false. Thankfully they're few in number, but every so often you see supposed \"leaders\" (such as in this article) making similar outrageous claims; here it was \"catastrophic\" and with Polly it was \"Armageddon\". Both of these sorts of warnings are hyperbole and people crying wolf, I'm just calling them out on it.\n\nOn the recession concerns, I know what you're getting at, but I have to correct you on a technical point; a recession is when growth is stagnant or negative for a short period, usually 2-4 quarters; longer and it's a depression. So when you say \"in a recession for 1-2 decades\" that doesn't make sense, that would be a depression. You later go on to say what I think you actually mean which is the *effects* of the recession would be felt for decades and on that front I agree, it's a legitimate concern.\n\nThe question for me comes down to who do you believe, to what degree, and what do you think will happen. If we go out on WTO and everything goes as bad as it could, we'll probably get that recession followed by years of catching up. But if we get a transitional deal, followed by a reasonable FTA, there probably won't be a recession at all, and our growth will likely hold up just fine. Long term, since we can make trade deals tailored for our country, and quicker than the EU since there are fewer cooks, we could open up a world of trade that means we grow faster than if we'd stayed.\n\nNow you're right, there is no land of milk and honey, everyone on both sides of this debate got a bit carried away with the degree to which Brexit will impact our economy. It could be good or it could be bad, but it'll be an adjustment, not a re-write. Both sides need to temper their claims and be realistic. Once you do that, you can have a proper debate about whether we want to run the risk of a recession and lower growth for the benefits of Brexit (control of laws, trade and so on).\n\nOn the austerity/etc front, I'm less concerned, but I realise this may be controversial. I think if Brexit does present recessionary dangers to the UK then the government will respond in kind. If there was ever a time for the Tories to spend on infrastructure it'll be to get us through a downturn, as they've said all along, and I think they'd do it; it just makes good sense as a nation to use government purchasing power to weather the Brexit storm.",

There is a very strong argument that such a decision should not have been made on the back of one divisive vote, yielding a mere 3.89% majority, which also threw up some constitutionally challenging results of splitting the UK's four constituent nations in half, and revealing a pronounced split in the voting demographics with 75% of 18-25 year olds voting to Remain.

    "body": "Nobody has predicted a depression. The *worst* case scenarios predict a recession. That's my point. So drop all talk of \"full on depression\", it just isn't happening and isn't predicted by *anyone*.\n\nThink about how GDP and GDP growth works. At the moment we're ticking along at 1-2% growth, and this continues every year. In the *worst case* Brexit predictions and outcome, we see a stagnation or contraction for 2-4 quarters (the recession) which means our GDP flatlines or recedes a small amount. After that we go back to growing 1-2% per quarter as we did before, but obviously we're now tracking a bit below where we would have been if we stayed.\n\nThe question now becomes, what degree do you attach to the two \"hits\"; first, how deep will the recession be and second how much will the growth rate be affected. If you believe the *worst case* predictions (eg. Treasury) in the *worst case* scenario (eg. WTO) then you end up \u00a35.5k worse off by 2030. If however, you believe some of the more middle-of-the-road predictions, then we don't drop as far and also close the gap quicker and get back to where we would have been quicker; from that point onwards we have the potential to growth faster than we would have under the EU, but now you're predicting a long way out ahead and can't say anything with confidence.\n\nSo no, either way we're not worse off. In the absolute worst case predictions and scenarios we're worse off, but we're nothing even close to the \"catastrophic\" or \"Armageddon\" claims made by hysterical Remainers; we're not even anywhere near a depression! And as with most things, the true predictions probably lie somewhere in the middle, at which point we're fine.\n\nOnce you understand all that, you have to decide whether you're willing to take the potential (small) hit to the economy in the worst case prediction/scenario for the benefits of Brexit; Nation over Income or Income over Nation.",

It's honestly not going to be as bad as you think it is.\n\nPre-Brexit Day, businesses and individuals will continue to move overseas. The UK government will blame the EU for refusing to agree to their idiotic demands. Brexit Day, we leave the EU with no deal, and three million people here and 1.2 million in the EU lose their right to live, work, get healthcare and so on.\n\nFor businesses, I think as it becomes apparent there will be no deal, EU companies will replace British suppliers. Our ability to buy from EU suppliers will be damaged, since we'll still be relatively poorer than we were pre-referendum and there will be no certainty that we can get things delivered to the UK in a sensible timeframe. A lot of companies are, I suspect, waiting until the last possible moment to make a decision about moving. \n\nFor a few weeks, I'm expecting some teething issues - a few food problems along with fuel. Nothing too serious, just some ridiculous headlines.\n\nThe following months will see a spate of companies going bust and moving overseas, and significant job losses, along with a recession.\n\nIn a couple of years, things will settle down and we'll be poorer than we would have been, though it might be difficult for anyone to tell. The EU will continue to grow quicker than us, and Brexiteers will shout about what a success it's been since we now control our borders.\n\nHousing, the NHS, services, our social fabric - will all be in a far worse state.\n\nI hope I'm wrong about all of the above, and I hope I'm wrong in a way that doesn't make the above look like an improvement.\n\n> We'll still be the 2nd largest economy in Europe long after Brexit.\n\nWe're only just the second largest now. It's not going to take long for France to overtake us if Brexit goes ahead.",
