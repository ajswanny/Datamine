I feel he's operating on a completely different level to most of his detractors, and they don't even realize it. Consider the business with Hillary's health - Trump was one of the few politicians I've ever seen prepare an attack using priming and pre-suasion. Or the use of social media (reading [here](http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2017/06/08/how-trump-used-facebook-to-win/) - one of the few articles to correctly play down Cambridge Analytica's tiny role - and [here](https://nplusonemag.com/online-only/online-only/confirmation-bias/)). Also the fact that people take a win through the electoral college without the popular vote as some kind of indication that his campaign was haphazard and poorly targeted, rather than *precisely the reverse*.",

I'm puzzled about why one's political opponents have to be complete idiots who only got where they did through sheer chance and how everything they say has no deeper level to it.\n\nI'm honestly curious about how well Bernie Sanders would have done against Trump. I suspect [that essay from 1972](http://www.snopes.com/bernie-sanders-essay/) would have been brought up. Newsweek say the Republicans had an opposition research folder on him two feet thick: http://www.newsweek.com/myths-cost-democrats-presidential-election-521044\n\n>  But so was Hitler. \n\ncan we not do this?",

Thomas Massie, who says the bill \u201cwould prohibit the U.S. government from using American taxpayer dollars to provide funding, weapons, training, and intelligence support to terrorist groups like al-Qaeda and ISIS, or to countries who are providing direct or indirect support to those same groups.\u201d\n\nA think tank founded by the former U.K. Prime Minister released a report in 2015 that concluded it was ultimately pointless to make a distinction between the various rebel groups on the ground since the majority of these groups share ISIS\u2019s core belief system (and would impose Sharia law if they came into power).\n\n\u201cThe CIA has also been funneling weapons and money through Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Qatar and others who provide direct and indirect support to groups like ISIS and al-Qaeda,\u201d Gabbard also stated on the House floor and went into more detail:\n\n\u201cThe CIA has long been supporting a group called Fursan al Haqq, providing them with salaries, weapons, and support, including surface to air missiles.  This group is cooperating with and fighting alongside an al-Qaeda affiliated group trying to overthrow the Syrian government. The Levant Front is another so-called moderate umbrella group of Syrian opposition fighters. Over the past year, the United States has been working with Turkey to give this group intelligence support and other forms of military assistance. This group has joined forces with al-Qaeda\u2019s offshoot group in Syria.\n \n\u201cThis madness must end. We must stop arming terrorists. The Government must end this hypocrisy and abide by the same laws that apply to its\u2019 citizens.\u201d\n\n",
