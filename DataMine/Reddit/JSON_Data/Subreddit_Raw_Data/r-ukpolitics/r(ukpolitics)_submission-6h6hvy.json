Because everything and everyone must be used to further the cause of the Great Corbyn, regardless of truth, right?\n\nEdit: some more details of the refurbishment the tower had:\n\nhttp://www.constructionenquirer.com/2017/06/14/blaze-engulfs-refurbished-london-tower-block/\n\n>Eyewitnesses claimed that the fire ripped through the building spreading rapidly up the cladding system.\n\n>The building is believed to have been over-clad with Aluminium Composite Material cassette rainscreen. This allows a moisture ventilating void between the metal composite and structural envelope. An intumescent strip is installed at regular intervals to seal the void in the event of fire.\n\n>Contractor Rydon delivered **an \u00a38.6m upgrade to the Grenfell Tower in 2016** as part of a \u00a357m borough-wide regeneration in Kensington & Chelsea.\n\n>The 1970s block was externally fitted with new rain screen cladding, a new curtain wall fa\u00e7ade and replacement windows to improving thermal insulation and modernise the exterior.\n\n>Cladding contractor Harley Curtain Wall fell into administration shortly after completing the \u00a33m Grenfell Tower project.\n\n>A spokesman for Rydon said: \u201cRydon completed a refurbishment of the building in the summer of 2016 for Kensington and Chelsea Tenant Management Organisation on behalf of the Council, which met all required building control, fire regulation and health & safety standards.\n\n>\u201cWe will cooperate with the relevant authorities and emergency services and fully support their enquiries into the causes of this fire at the appropriate time.",

UKIP were criticised for \"opportunism\" for a poster saying \"1400 reasons not to vote Labour\" after the Rotherham revelations, but weren't they merely doing their job? It'll be the same with Labour and this tragedy - they'll blame it on cuts. They're allowed to do that.",

I agree the deciding where to build is based on which locations provide the biggest profits, but the overall rate is independent of that at the moment.\n\n> government investment in house building where profit isn't the priority\n\nI haven't read enough of the literature to really understand the subtlties of this, but at the moment housebuilders are making huge profits and can afford to pay their employees top dollar, there is a skills shortage in the construction industry which I take as meaning there is a limited pool of workers. For the government to do its own housebuilding, it would have to poach those same workers from the private housebuilders, by paying them more than they currently earn. The private housebuilders, with their huge profits, will be able to poach back the workers with higher wages.\n\nCan the government justify it? Not a conservative government.

Although historically only used in factories and large commercial buildings, systems for homes and small buildings are now available at a cost-effective price. Fire sprinkler systems are extensively used worldwide, with over 40 million sprinkler heads fitted each year. In buildings completely protected by fire sprinkler systems, over 96% of fires were controlled by fire sprinklers alone.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.2",

    "body": "I think a lot of people will understand where you're coming from, but there are very real material conditions which have lead to the \"anger, bitterness and division\". People haven't become angry and tribal for no reason or without good cause. The reason people are angry, bitter and divided *is because of how society is organised* - and politics is simply that subject which focuses on how we organise society. \n\nNaturally when a lot of people take serious issue with how society is organised our public discourse becomes much more politicised - and very often angry, divisive and bitter. The fact that society is currently organised in a manner which is leaving a lot of people hungry, homeless, financially insecure, dependent on food banks and/or uncertain about their future in one of the wealthiest countries in the world is (at least for me) good enough reason for people to be furious, bitter and divisive - though \"fuk u dinner-snatching tax-dodging tory fukkboiii\" isn't necessary a constructive engagement with these issues.\n\nThere are irreconcilable conflicts of interest between different sections of the population and for most of the latter half of the 20th Century these divides and the social-ills we're seeing now were softened through a welfare state supported to some extent by both the pre-Thatcher Tories and Labour. Add forty odd years of dismantling said welfare state and reasonably polite disagreement over seemingly abstract ideological positions becomes vitriolic, concrete and personal when your Grandmother dies because she was on a waiting list for 14 months for a cancer operation due to cuts in the NHS, or you're facing homelessness because social housing supply has collapsed whilst rent prices keep going up and you're unwillingly working on a 0-hours contract. \n\nYou're right, it is difficult to have cool and calm discussions just now. Whether you blame neo-liberalism, austerity, immigrants, a lack of bootstrap-pulling or too much regulation for the aforementioned is entirely dependent on your political perspective and so are the solutions you offer; if we didn't have these problems people wouldn't be so angry. Political disagreements are not like disagreements over football teams or what constitutes a nice pint; somebody's preference for ale over cider isn't going to affect the lives of millions of people in quite fundamental ways. Frankly, I welcome shitty political engagement over total apathy any day - to quote Brecht:\n\n>The worst illiterate is the political illiterate, he doesn\u2019t hear, doesn\u2019t speak, nor participates in the political events. He doesn\u2019t know the cost of life, the price of the bean, of the fish, of the flour, of the rent, of the shoes and of the medicine, all depends on political decisions. The political illiterate is so stupid that he is proud and swells his chest saying that he hates politics. The imbecile doesn\u2019t know that, from his political ignorance is born the prostitute, the abandoned child, and the worst thieves of all, the bad politician, corrupted and flunky of the national and multinational companies.\n\nWe should be civil when trying to have serious exchanges. We should eviscerate people for putting forth 'half truths and simplistic generalisations' as you say, but we should welcome increased interest in politics and we should be angry over the *causes* of the widespread discontent and not the discontent itself. If things continue as they are, we're going to see a lot more anger, bitterness and division for years to come.",
