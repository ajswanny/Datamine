The incident killed four people and injured 17. Although casualties were relatively few, the spectacular nature of the failure \u2013 caused by both poor design and poor construction \u2013 led to complete loss of public confidence in high-rise residential buildings, and major changes in UK building regulations resulted.\n\nRonan Point, named after Deputy Mayor Harry Ronan (a former Chairman of the Housing Committee of the London Borough of Newham), was part of the wave of tower blocks built in the 1960s as cheap, affordable prefabricated housing for inhabitants of West Ham and other areas of London. The tower was built by Taylor Woodrow Anglian using a technique known as Large Panel System building (LPS), which involves casting large concrete prefabricated sections off-site and bolting them together to construct the building.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.21",

Our neighbours hate on us, the people across the street complained about my car, next door constantly make passive aggressive digs about the garden and that I should get a man in to make it look nice. I can't afford to get a man in, I take what little time I have between working to try to make it look nice. I have to work nights on the weekends to have a chance at having some savings, again the neighbours have moaned about me waking them up coming in late and pulling into the drive on a Sunday, I've taken to sleeping at work Saturday nights and coming home in the mornings to avoid the complaints. We could have stayed in the poor area we were in, in a flat more suitable to our income, but I made a choice to try to climb the ladder for the sake of my step son and our future baby. But all the area wants to do is look down on us and make us feel unwelcome. We are trying to better ourselves and it's looked down on because we aren't rich already.",

Read Weber on the [protestant ethic and capitalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Protestant_Ethic_and_the_Spirit_of_Capitalism).\n\nThe accumulation of wealth through rational means, is not in and of itself a rational goal. It is a legacy of irrational superstition:the good are rewarded in this life and this is a sign of predestination. The poor were those who were already being punished, a sign of their depravity and inevitable descent to hell.\n\nDeep down vast swathes of the public still believe the poor deserve to be poor. That this is their punishment for some unspeakable evil they committed. Being poor is punishment for the immoral. Being poor is immoral.\n\nIt is a despicable attitude, held by scared but otherwise good people, who are unwilling to admit that good people are burnt alive while some of the worst, rapacious and hurtful people live enchanted lives of luxury. Better to lie to themselves, so they can fool themselves into believing it would never happen to them. Deep down there's a little voice that says: 'I'm good. I will never be raped, murdered or robbed. I am good. I will never be homeless, mentally ill or handicapped...' \n\nAnd this is why, all that is necessary for the triumph of evil is that good men do nothing. Although you have to ask yourself how many people are truly good, given how rampant cowardice, greed and selfishness is.\n\ne: sorry. I think I needed to vent.",

Recently it broke and she finally replaced with cheap \u00a3100 ish modern fridge. Is going to pay for its self in first year in saved electricity.  Old fridges can end up being a surprising costly to run.  So not just them being dangerous. If old enough you may cover some of the cost of a new one as will be more energy efficient.

Begun as a series of essays, the original German text was composed in 1904 and 1905, and was translated into English for the first time by American sociologist Talcott Parsons in 1930. It is considered a founding text in economic sociology and sociology in general.\n\nIn the book, Weber wrote that capitalism in Northern Europe evolved when the Protestant (particularly Calvinist) ethic influenced large numbers of people to engage in work in the secular world, developing their own enterprises and engaging in trade and the accumulation of wealth for investment. In other words, the Protestant work ethic was an important force behind the unplanned and uncoordinated emergence of modern capitalism.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.21",

It would be financially ruinous\n\nExcept free (or extremely cheap) tuition is quite common across Europe.\n\nThis reminds me of the argument about public healthcare in the United States - there are many that say it's 'too expensive', despite the fact that most of the developed world has it. There are also many people in the UK who claim the NHS is a 'financial black hole' despite it being one of the most efficient health services in the entire world.\n\nIt's also the charge levelled at many of Jeremy Corbyn's policies, such as nationalisation. However, these are **not** radical ideas in much of the developed world. Germany does just fine with nationalised railways and publicly-owned energy providers...why can't we?\n\n\"We can't afford it\" is the chief way that the rich try to trick the poor into screwing themselves over. The developed countries of the world are *extraordinarily* rich, and getting richer as GDP per capita continues to rise. We can afford pretty much anything we need to live in a civilised, advanced social democracy (including safe and affordable public housing), but some political parties think it's a higher priority to give tax breaks to multimillionaires.\n\nEdit: spelling",

People aren't going to train to be doctors when they're being told that although it was free for the previous generation, they now have to pay \u00a350,000+ in tuition. \n\nPeople forget that a mere decade ago, university education was free in the U.K., hell in Scotland it still is! Now, those same people are expected to plunge head first into debt, an NHS in crisis and stagnating wages? Why would they bother? Even if they do train here, why wouldn't they move abroad to earn more and wipe their debt? This is a specific example but it's demonstrative of the bigger picture. Our levels of doctors, scientists and engineers drop year after year because people don't want an extra penny on their taxes. \n\nDid the idea of a country helping fund it's internal training of essential workers such as teachers, engineers, scientists, nurses, lawyers, accountants, dieticians, psychologists etc. disgust you back in 1997 when it was the norm? \n\nIf we raised corporation tax and high-income tax like the Labour manifesto outlined, then a National Education Service is possible.

He has to pay extra tax so others can earn more than him. \n\nAnother example would be myself. Free education enabled me to get a degree (graduated in 1995) which would have otherwise been impossible; there simply wasn't the money for such a luxury and as it was I had to go to the 3rd lowest ranked university in the country at the time (Wolverhampton), because it was the one closest to home and thus I could travel every day and avoid housing costs.

I'm not sure that's reasonable or realistic, it would be like asking a Parish Council or Residents Association for a tiny village to look after water safety. I think there isn't going to be a magic solution to distributing power in a way that will solve this, probably you need something like a national watchdog that is responsible for all high-rise buildings, and actively engaged in looking worldwide for lessons to be learned, which can then enforce inspections and solutions on landlords, whether they're public, charitable or private.",

Kensington and Chelsea TMO is the largest TMO in the UK and is unique in being both the only TMO that runs the entire housing stock for the local council but also in being the only TMO that is also an arms-length management organisation (ALMO).\n\n***\n\n**Arms-length management organisation**\n\nIn the United Kingdom, an arms-length management organisation (ALMO) is a not-for-profit company that provides housing services on behalf of a local authority. Usually an ALMO is set up by the authority to manage and improve all or part of its housing stock. Ownership of the housing stock itself normally stays with the local authority. As of July 2008, seventy ALMOs were managing over half of all UK council housing, consisting of more than a million properties. This number has since reduced as local authorities have taken services back in-house or stock has been transferred, of 2016 there are 37 ALMOs who manage nearly a third of local authority housing, approximately half a million council and ALMO homes.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.21",
