I served 8 years, and walked away with nothing. Life in the U.K. has for me never been great, but it has given me opportunities, which I may never have got anywhere else. \nI am now in my third year at university, for the love Odin, I don't know why but I want to be a teacher, I'm not saying I will be the best, but I want to try and hopefully make a difference and give something back. What I keep reading here, is painfully negative, off course the U.K. Is broken it's been broken for years, however so is most, if not all of the countries around the world. I know I will never own a house, I know I will  have too work long hours ( I work over 50 hours a week doing two jobs), I know I will need to work till I'm way past retirement and my pension will not support a great life when I can no longer work.\nBut hey ho, get on with it, get involved in politics, get involved making voices heard, and if you think you can't make a difference on a big scale get involved in local activities, get into mentoring programs, helping the homeless, support on banks. \nRunning away from a problem isn't going to solve it, and you maybe jumping into a greater nightmare.",

My parents are both self employed, white van man type and a photographer. I am the first and last in my family to go to university and fuck me I chose to study drawing of all things (there is no career in this and I've never earned a penny from the \u00a330k odd I took as a student loan to go). I have never had money or help from them because I was to embarrassed to ask because they could not spare it. This is not some rich guy from a rich family looking down on you.\n\nHow are you struggling so much if you really are working your arse off every day? I was on \u00a320,000 working a sales role in London working on average 13 hours a day. Things were incredibly tight. I was living away from my parents renting and sharing with 7 others. I studied for free most nights and weekends to train myself to get a job in the tech sector, this even cost me my relationship at the time. I managed to get out and just landed a job at \u00a330k. Its not much and in a few years ill be on much more. Everything I trained myself to do is completely free of charge to learn and you can start a freelance side business doing it in as little as 6 months if  you want for  extra cash. This sector is crying out for applicants and with Brexit the shortage of trained workers is going to get even worse.\n\nIf you are struggling to even buy clothes you need to sit down, budget, pay down your debts as fast as possible. Work out what is important to you. Do you need to live on your own? Can you share? Can you sell your junk to pay down debts. Do you understand personal finance and how to make money work for you more effectively. Register for FREE and learn a valuable new skillset online. You have had 18 years of some of the best free education in the world, you should have been able to use that foundation to work out a path to a better life. Its not rocket science, you don't need to start your own business or take huge risks. Look at what you know and what you can learn and see where you can genuinely add value. People will clamber to pay you money for it. Its literally that simple.\n\nSet goals, write them down and go and hit them. \n\nIt pains me to hear of people struggling so much. I am literally willing to help you work out a path into the tech sector and direct you to learning resources if you are open to it. You do not need to struggle forever.\n\n",

One doesn't need to work in Financial Industry to know that GBP would strongly depreciate as businesses would have to leave (more money going out than in --> depreciation).\n\nWith GBP depreciating, as UK is Importing and not exporting, Inflation would go up. As Inflation goes up standards of living decrease. And this which economical benefit ? Extra jobs? Balance Sheet cleaning? No... For the moment nothing. This is just lost.\n\nAnd there aren't import tariffs yet. If during Brexit talks there isn't an agreement on commercial borders one can only expect the worse...\n\nSecond stage would be: so let's produce inlands.\n\nThat would allow first stage pain to be useful for something. Let's suffer now to have a better future tomorrow. It makes sense. But: if you produce inlands you will anyway strongly increase production cost (so inflation going up, purchasing power going down) as a British worker costs much more than a Polish/Chinese producing in Poland/China and exporting in UK.\n\nSo that's a double plain. \n\nThat would help people that are today jobless as they would find a low qualification job that is done today by Polish/Chinese workers. \n\nBut, that comes at the expense of people that TODAY are working in the service industry (majority of workers) as they won't benefit from an increase in salary but suffer from inflation (due to depreciation, trade tariffs, increased production costs).\n\nTo be honest... I'll never understand why Brexit... UK was pretty much free to make anything it wanted...\n\nAnd I'm not even talking about the CAP: all the money British farmers are receiving from European subsidies will just go out. Turning things more difficult for people that are already suffering...\n\nAnd I'm not even talking about the divorce bill.",

Really kind of shocking how normalised it is for friends on decent pay who are living in rabbit hutches on 'decent incomes' at home. I'm not sure how I'd deal with moving back now If I was forced to as I enjoy life here while the UK was just a cycle of shit sales 'jobs' no experience for real jobs and those real jobs pay crap compared to cost of living. \n\n\nIf I'm honest I find it pretty disgraceful what's been done to the young imposing a 'born after 1980 tax' in the form of the various student loans and then screwing them with austerity and refusing to do anything about tenancy rights where they could easily make life less shit and unstable for the increasing number of people renting as opposed to treating them as untermenschen. Forgetting about all of the other stuff these are two areas where they could massively improve peoples quality of life pretty easily. ",

These criteria include:\n\n- proficiency with an official language of Canada (I'm pretty sure those of you posting on this subreddit will have no problems here)\n\n- age (people in their 20s are most preferred because you have plenty more years to contribute to the Canadian treasury with your taxes)\n\n- education (if you haven't been to university, don't bother)\n\n- work experience (work experience in any country counts, but if you've previously worked in Canada on a work visa, that's worth even more)\n\n- job prospects in Canada (if you already have an offer letter to work in Canada, your chances go way up)\n\nThere is a limited quota per year; the highest-scoring *N* applicants are invited to become a permanent resident. You also have to [not have committed any of these offences](http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/information/inadmissibility/index.asp) which will make you ineligible, or failing that, wait a few years until you can be [deemed rehabilitated](http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/information/inadmissibility/conviction.asp).\n\nIf you can't get in via the standard process, there are a few other ways to get in:\n\na) make lots of money, plan to use that money to start a business in Canada, and convince [one of these Canadian investors](http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/immigrate/business/start-up/eligibility/entities.asp) to invest in your business.\n\nb) have a relative who's already in the country to sponsor you (if you don't have any Canadian relatives, might be time to marry a Canadian)\n\nc) enter Canada on a work visa, work in an occupation in high demand, and perform well enough to be nominated as a candidate for permanent residency. See [here](http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/immigrate/provincial/apply-who.asp) to see what types of workers each province is looking for.\n\nd) have the government of your country be really mean to you, to the point of threatening to kill or torture you, enter Canada by any means necessary, and apply for asylum\n\nOnce you have obtained permanent residency, you need to remain in the country for at least three years while neither committing an offence serious enough to go to jail nor failing to pay your taxes. After that, you must [pass an exam](http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/resources/publications/discover/section-04.asp) on Canada's geography, history, and political institutions.\n\nFinally, you must swear allegiance to HM Queen Elizabeth II (and all her successors) in her capacity as sovereign of Canada.",

    "body": "Can think of loads of vocational subjects that don't require you to program, and which pay a decent salary.\n\nMechanic or maintenance technician for instance.  Mechanics get hourly rates of ~\u00a315 an hour around my area. EMC or systems engineer \u00a340k if you've the experience. Test setup engineer \u00a325k. Electronics technician (able to wield a soldering iron more or less) for \u00a325k.\n\nPlumber/gas engineer - especially if you're independent you can clear some serious money.  But you can settle with a fair salary as well.  Example, British Gas have an apprenticeship that pays \u00a330k once you \"graduate\" as a technician and they pretty much only need you to have half-decent GCSEs to apply.\n\nNational Grid are crying out for network analysts and systems engineers as they're facing a shortage as their older staff retire.  Had a friend with a 2:2 in Elec Eng and ten years experience at Morrisons (as a shelf stacker) apply and he got accepted straight away.  \n\nEven the industrial design engineer at the company I work for has little formal education (3 year degree in engineering),  just lots of experience,  started off making cardboard boxes, now the lead industrial design engineer at our firm.  \n\nI've seen GCHQ looking out just for people who are smart - not necessarily programmers - if you don't mind working for the government.  \u00a321k starting salary in Cheltenham.\n\nIn my case I started off with an internship and worked while I was in uni, now I'm earning just under \u00a330k a year in Leeds.  Cost of living is low in the North so \u00a330k is not bad at all (though I wouldn't mind more)\n\nI speak from the background of engineering but there are other fields out there with similar vocational access.  It's a great field to be involved in though.\n\nYou do have to push,  you do need to try hard,  but there is not a shortage of skilled work out there for those who want it.\n",

If you question this premise you're immediately labelled naive. So people are throwing a wrench into the works of the establishment.

When people suffered the job losses and repossessions banks were bailed out and ever since there's been this feeling among the people that there is an establishment conspiracy who only look after themselves.\n\nWell it's hardly a conspiracy the establishment will do that.\n\nThough the system had to be bailed. Maybe not quite in this way but it was done in a panic.\n\n> If you question this premise you're immediately labelled naive. So people are throwing a wrench into the works of the establishment. A substantial portion of the people would rather suffer personal damage and destroy/damage the system than suffer what they perceive to be wholly unfair.\n\nI think there is a reaction against mass migration, multiculturalism and the economic effects of neoliberalism and technology in there.\n\nOverall a push towards nationalism and socialism that trends old and the poor.\n\nWhere as the rich and the young trend towards globalist and capitalism.\n\n> I'm roughly in the centre.\n\nHas the centre become far right economically and far left socially?\n\n> Biased towards free trade and free markets, internationalism but with a sufficient safety net.\n\nIsn't free markets and free trade a far right libertarian economic ideology?\n\nDo you mean regulated trade and regulated markets?\n\nHas that safety net gone.\n\nI see a regular position that says the collapse of the middle class in the rich countries is a price worth paying for raising the global poor out of poverty.\n\nYou can argue the moral case but it seems politically unsustainable for obvious reasons.\n\n> It's a reference to Theresa May's speech. I identify myself as a citizen of the world. Her actual quote is \"If you believe you're a citizen of the world you're a citizen of nowhere; you don't understand what the very word citizenship means\"\n\nI just don't know if it's good politics. To me it sounds problematic for a number of reasons. As if their values are universal values rather than Western Liberalism, which they always tend to be. Rather like assuming they don't have an accent or that they don't have a culture.\n\nGlobalist rhetoric seems to over reach. I mean it's fine to think of the world as one, but I'm not sure a person can be culturally or politically one. At that point it becomes something else.\n\n>> What do you think of the Jonathan Haidt take on the political tribalism?\n\n> Don't know. Haven't read it.\n\n[The psychology behind globalism, nationalism & political tribalism - Jonathan Haidt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2xmnR-NbUM)\n\n\nI find his take the most illuminating at the moment. I'm caught between him Mark Blyth and Andrew McAfee.\n\nPerhaps the three drivers of the rebellion culture, economics and technology.\n\nMaybe technology is the ultimate driver.\n\n",

I think the majority of the people in the establishment are genuinely convinced that they're doing the right thing. There are black sheep who sometimes get caught and cause scandals, creating an impression that they're the norm, but don't think it's the case.\n\n> I think there is a reaction against mass migration, multiculturalism and the economic effects of neoliberalism and technology in there.\n\nAgree. I suspect that partly immigration concerns are also mingled together with thinking that the elites want mass immigration so that they can lower wages and make larger profits. \n\n> Isn't free markets and free trade a far right libertarian economic ideology?\n> Do you mean regulated trade and regulated markets?\n\nSure, there should be appropriate safety regulations and such. The type of regulations I don't like too much are restrictions on firing people and such. The government should create a sufficient safety net for people so that this isn't an issue. Happy to pay tax to see it happen. See my other post in reply to u/komrade_kwestion where I wrote in greater detail.\n\n> I just don't know if it's good politics. To me it sounds problematic for a number of reasons. As if their values are universal values rather than Western Liberalism, which they always tend to be. Rather like assuming they don't have an accent or that they don't have a culture. \n> Globalist rhetoric seems to over reach. I mean it's fine to think of the world as one, but I'm not sure a person can be culturally or politically one. At that point it becomes something else.\n\nEvery rhetoric these days seems super extreme. I mean of course people have their own culture and political preferences and so on. But I like to treat people as individuals. \n\n> The psychology behind globalism, nationalism & political tribalism - Jonathan Haidt\n> I find his take the most illuminating at the moment. I'm caught between him Mark Blyth and Andrew McAfee.\n> Perhaps the three drivers of the rebellion culture, economics and technology.\n> Maybe technology is the ultimate driver.\n\nI'm sure it's contributing. It's not so conspicuous because it's less political, but I totally agree that it's having a big impact. ",

I'm against taking energy companies into public ownership (especially without compensation) and I'm on the fence about railways, I'm in favour of EU free movement (and lighter restrictions for the rest of the world than now), in favour of personal freedoms like gay marriage + adoption, prostitution, cannabis etc. I'm against financial transaction tax and oppose corporation tax (on the grounds that it effectively levies taxes on foreign production) it should be repealed globally and replaced with a higher income tax.

And as economists like Herman Daly, Soddy, and Georgesu Roegan make clear, any economic system which hinges upon debt issued currency (there is always less money in circulation than debts, such that all profit engenders greater debt and so poverty elsewhere in the system; hence 80 percent of the planet in poverty, living on less than 10 dollars a day) leads to a global economic ponzi which requires constant production, consumption and growth - in a futile attempt to \"catch up with debt\" - to avoid collapse. The system must expand or die, and very little of these expansions trickle profits down to the majority.

I think this goes too far into the future for any of us to be able to make meaningful predictions.\n\n> . And as economists like Herman Daly, Soddy, and Georgesu Roegan make clear, any economic system which hinges upon debt issued currency (there is always less money in circulation than debts, such that all profit engenders greater debt and so poverty elsewhere in the system; hence 80 percent of the planet in poverty, living on less than 10 dollars a day) leads to a global economic ponzi which requires constant production, consumption and growth - in a futile attempt to \"catch up with debt\" - to avoid collapse.\n\nAll money is debt. When you work somebody else instead of working for you in return gives you money, basically saying IOU. I disagree that debt is poverty. Debt enables us to start enterprises that you couldn't start without it. Before debt markets, people would have to save up for decades to start a business even if it would be profitable they wouldn't be able to start it. Debt is an indispensable tool that. Used with moderation, debt has a good impact on growth.\n\n> hence 80 percent of the planet in poverty, living on less than 10 dollars a day\n\nGlobal poverty has been improving though. This graph sets the poverty limit at $2 per day, but you can see people becoming better off as time goes on.\nhttps://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/World-Poverty-Since-1820.png\n\n> leads to a global economic ponzi which requires constant production, consumption and growth - in a futile attempt to \"catch up with debt\" - to avoid collapse\n\nWhat would you prefer to production, consumption and growth? Most people like these things.\n\n> The system must expand or die, and very little of these expansions trickle profits down to the majority.\n\nHumanity has pulled huge numbers of people out of poverty. You can see that on the graph I posted above. Why do you think it's not trickling down?\n\n> Environmentalism and free market fundamentalism are not compatible (indeed, a recent UN report shows no business is profitable if environmental costs were tabulated; a basic thermodynamic law- aggregate profit is impossible) unless you're willing to screw billions and billions of human beings.\n\nGovernment places a constraint on pollution and the free market maximizes profits within those constraints. Don't see why we can't have both. ",

These statements are so wrapped up with ideology, bound so tightly under layers of assumptions mistaken as facts, that we must take time to pick apart these assumptions to reach a more critical analysis. This is no easy task, each time we do this we confront our own ideology, a process that is uncomfortable. So uncomfortable that it is desirable to dismiss or reject.
