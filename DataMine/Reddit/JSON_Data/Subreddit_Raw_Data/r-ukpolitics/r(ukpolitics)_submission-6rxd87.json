    "body": "It\u2019s interesting that Vince Cable thinks the reasoning for the majority of older voters supporting Leave was because of having a \u2018\u2026world view coloured by nostalgia for an imperial past\u2019 because for the most part the older people who voted leave were the same people who voted to join what became the EU in the first place. So does this mean in the past these older people were progressives \u2018comfortable with modern Europe\u2019 but all of a sudden became nationalistic old racists? Obviously, that is not the case. \n\n\nHaving lost the debate Vince Cable now resorts to the disgusting rhetoric of name-calling and identity based political tactics. Whilst older people were more likely to vote leave, and youth more likely to vote remain not all older people voted leave and not all younger people voted remain. It\u2019s a shame because I\u2019m sure in his speech after losing his seat, Nick Clegg talked about the various divides in the country, one of which being age. Vince Cable then goes ahead and attacks people, not based on their ideas or policy but attacks a voting demographic due to their age, he does not even go onto explain how older people have \u201ccomprehensively shafted the young\u201d, this is just rhetoric. Provided that remain won, would anyone have expected a high-profile leave campaigner to accuse the young of \u2018shafting the elderly\u2019?\n\n\nAfter this name calling, in which he singled out and attacked a specific age-based group Vince Cable even had the audacity to say, \u201cWe haven't yet heard about 'Brexit jihadis' but there is an undercurrent of violence in the language which is troubling.\u201d However, because he lost the argument and could not convenience people to his viewpoint in civil debate the only person choosing to use vile language here is Vince Cable, not only attacking people due to a viewpoint, but because of their age, name-calling instead of debate.\n\n\nThis paragraph might go off topic a bit (sorry), but I really do hate this kind of \u2018politics\u2019, because this is not real politics in my eyes. These types of remarks provide no meaningful political discussion and such comments provide absolutely no value other than clicks and comments for journalists, which I guess I\u2019m now guilty of aiding. We see this often, both in the real world and whilst my favourite part of Reddit, we sometimes see this type of \u2018politics\u2019 in /r/ukpolitics too. As an example, I will use argument over tuition fees. I like the sort of debate when people in favour of abolishing tuition fees can put their case and the arguments as to why this would be of net benefit whilst those, like myself, who are against the policy, can say why they feel this way. Thus, both sides understand each other\u2019s viewpoint, some may be convinced and if not you will at least know why the other side feels that way and agree to disagree with each other, then move on with our lives. Now what I then dislike, as Vince Cable has done is when the argument becomes, not about ideas/policy but instead becomes name-calling and implying the intent of the other side. For instance, when those in favour of abolishing tuition fees don\u2019t give reasons for the policy but accuse those against of being evil old people who had their tuition for free and now want to deny the young of the same opportunities because they are rich and selfish. Alternatively, it\u2019s the same if someone opposed to abolishing tuition fees just says that the young were foolish and bribed by Corbyn as opposed to putting the case against the suggested policy.\n\n\nWhilst Vince Cables disgusting comments have utterly no meaningful value, there is my eyes purpose of the insulting, identity politics based rhetoric used. Obviously what Vince Cable and the so-called Liberal Democrats want is to use this language in order to convince many younger remaining supporting Corbyn voters to instead support himself. However, I doubt this will work, whilst I disagree with Labour, many of the younger folk who voted for Corbyn liked what they heard and thus voted accordingly, despite the Liberal Democrats having a hard-line pro-EU stance during the 2017 election \u2013 why would this change now with the addition of attacking people based on identity (in this case age)?\n",

I've spoken to a lot of migrants on the issue, 90% whom agree, and this isn't some bigoted opinion. Hey ho this is a critical opinion against something 'progressive' though. ",

It was either stay as we are or face uncertainty that could go either way. Risky yes but the EU is a very unstable ship right now. There's some great aspects of the EU that I'd love to keep but people are tired of their voices not being heard ... And as you can see, it's the decade of protest votes.",

A good number of studies show just how broad the spectrum of reasons behind the elderly leave vote, and a significant proportion of them were associated with a lack of understanding of the function and purpose of the EU. \n\nThere have been several studies recently conducted to demonstrate the gross misunderstanding of what the EU costs us, what it spends on administration, how it affects our daily lives. The conclusion from these studies is that it is not as simple as a wisened older generation or a naive youth. Rather, the young are more familiar with the role of the EU within their lives. \n\nVincent cables statement accurately describes the sentiment within my own family, whereby the older generation  cannot hold a debate over the EU, and must rely on soundbites and broad sweeping statements to support their claim, and betray a seriously narrow understanding of what the EU is and does.

Allow me to explain the best I can (I ain't a professional so I'd read up about this instead of some random Redditor,) from what I understand, The British have control over the French side of the border, so we have our border control men in callie, this allows us to stop people from being in the U.K before they're on the boat or train. If France got sick of us being a bit whiney they could say we're not doing this anymore and stop letting us control the border from the other side and if that happens, they could get into England, claim refugee status and not have to go back where as with the status co, there's a decent chance for keeping them out (not for or against refugees coming to the U.K just stating a fact so please go make an informed decision about this) ",

In other words, living in someone else's property (the taxpayers). The teeniest, tiniest, gentlest nudge to elderly people living alone in 2, 3, or 4 bedroom houses after their kids moved out, to maybe consider moving into a smaller property so that the [2 million or so families](http://www.gmb.org.uk/newsroom/housing-waiting-list) who have been waiting for an adequately sized property in their area aren't having to wait years while their children sleep 2 or more to a bedroom.\n\nThe so-called bedroom tax is about the only tory policy I agree with. Jeremy Corbyn himself could've come up with it, if the tories hadn't gotten there first. \n\nIt's your taxpayer money and mine that pays for grandma to live in that spacious house she doesn't need. In almost any true socialist or communist society, she'd have been turfed out by now to make way for a family in greater need. In almost any society before the welfare state she'd have had to move out, or have others move in, in order to afford to live.\n\nIt's outrageous that any generation's taxes are paying for this. The elderly living in their own homes should be furious too. If it were my grandma living in a huge council house, I'd be coming round every day to make her a nice cup of tea, have a chat about the weather, and tell her to get the fuck out of that house. I'd be ringing up the council to tell them all about those unoccupied bedrooms, and asking them to send us information on nice 1 bedroom apartments, and no doubt the council would be thrilled at such a proactive approach to freeing up space in their system. I'd use up my annual leave popping round to see that she'd packed all her stuff, and carry her out the fucking door if I have to. \"Yes yes, ma. I know, I know. You've lived here your whole life you poor thing. I'm listening. Oh look! This 1 bedroom flat has a brand new combi boiler installed! Fantastic!\" \n\nBecause I CARE. I care about the family going without. And because I know grandma isn't as fragile as she looks, and that back in the day she swore, shagged, and glue sniffed like everyone else. And that she's clinging onto this 3 bedroom house because she's a bitch, like a lot of old women are.

[mistranscription?] **I think we have gone through a period when too many children and people have been given to understand \u201cI have a problem, it is the Government's job to cope with it!\u201d or \u201cI have a problem, I will go and get a grant to cope with it!\u201d \u201cI am homeless, the Government must house me!\u201d and so they are casting their problems on society and who is society? There is no such thing! There are individual men and women** and [end p29] there are families and no government can do anything except through people and people look to themselves first. It is our duty to look after ourselves and then also to help look after our neighbour and life is a reciprocal business and people have got the entitlements too much in mind without the obligations, because there is no such thing as an entitlement unless someone has first met an obligation.\n>\n> it is, I think, one of the tragedies in which **many of the benefits we give, which were meant to reassure people that if they were sick or ill there was a safety net and there was help**, that many of the benefits which were meant to help people who were unfortunate\u2014\u201cIt is all right. We joined together and we have these insurance schemes to look after it\u201d. **That was the objective, but somehow there are some people who have been manipulating the system** and so some of those help and benefits that were meant to say to people: \u201cAll right, if you cannot get a job, you shall have a basic standard of living!\u201d but when people come and say: \u201cBut what is the point of working? I can get as much on the dole!\u201d You say: \u201cLook\u201d It is not from the dole. It is your neighbour who is supplying it and if you can earn your own living then really you have a duty to do it and you will feel very much better!\u201d\n\nThatcher's point was really just a rather anodyne point which few politicians would disagree with - that benefits are meant to be a safety net, not a lifestyle, that the dole is funded by tax on people (neighbours) who work, and that abuse of the welfare system is bad.",

The attitude of the council will sort it or government will pay is rampant in this country.

The equivilent house on the private rental market in this area is in the region of \u00a31,350 a month.\n\nWhat pisses me off the most about this whole situation is that there are young families that need these 4 bed houses, young families that are struggling to get by because private rental is so much more expensive. \n\nThe whole social housing system in the UK is broken beyond belief and from my (admittedly anecdotal) experience it is British people playing the system that are the real issue, not immigrants. This is not just limited to old people hogging huge houses but people of all ages, for example:\n\nI worked with a woman who's mum lived in a 4 bedroom council house, she (my colleague) discovered that if she was put on the rental contract with her mum she could then use the council's right to buy scheme to buy the council house.\n\nSide note: The right to buy scheme allows tenants of council houses to purchase the home they occupy at a massive discount. There is a minimum rental period of 5 years usually and the longer you occupy the bigger the discount you get when buying. The maximum where I live for example is a \u00a370,000 discount which on an average council house in this area would be half the market value.\n\nSo, my colleague moved back in with her mum, got added to the rental contract and then using her mum's accrued right to buy discount bought her mum's council house for half it's market value. My colleague was on the rental books for one month before buying.\n\nSo this meant that not only was there one less large home in the council's social housing portfolio but that someone who was a council tenant for one month bought a council house at full discount.",
