Or maybe that it's better not to eat cheese before you sleep.\n\nEither way it was a scary realisation.",

Blessed is he that watcheth, and keepeth his garments, lest he walk naked, and they see his shame.  \n>And he shall gather them together into a place, which in Hebrew is called Megiddo (Armageddon).  \n>And the seventh angel poured out his vial upon the air, and there came a great voice out of the temple from the throne, saying: It is done.  \n>And there were lightnings, and voices, and thunders, and there was a great earthquake, such an one as never had been since men were upon the earth, such an earthquake, so great.  \n>And the great city was divided into three parts; and the cities of the Gentiles fell. And great Babylon came in remembrance before God, to give her the cup of the wine of the indignation of his wrath.  \n>And every island fled away, and the mountains were not found.    \n>And great hail, like a talent, came down from heaven upon men: and men blasphemed God for the plague of the hail: because it was exceeding great.  \n\nTo be fair, sounds like it'll be hard to say you didn't see it coming!",

I can only imagine how many caches of weapons and explosives there must be dotted round the major cities in Europe. Islamic state have a whole army in Europe and hundreds of thousands of eager recruits. You have no idea how bad it could be. \n\nIn 1968 around 40,000 Vietcong geurilla fighters popped out of the wood work all over South Vietnam and assaulted critical targets in every major city including the capital. It became known as the tet offensive. There were pitched gun battles in the streets of Siagon just outside the presidential palace. A suicide squad blew a hole in the wall of the US embassy compound and got into several of the buildings. They assaulted the airstrip where MACV command was based (known as Pentagon East) and over ran the South Vietnamese police compound in Saigon. Roving death squads killed \"enemies of the revolution\" in their homes and on the streets. All over the capital there was heavy street to street fighting. Some of the worst fighting happened in Hue city. Marines fought weeks of street to street, house by house battles. Most of the city was destroyed. South Vietnam was a fortress. 485,000 US troops. Another 500,000 plus troops in the ARVN. They could call on fire support from mortars and artillery over most of the country. Air power the likes of which has never been seen. Rules of engagement that amounted to \"kill anything that moves\". \n\nSo ask yourself what kind of utter carnage a similar insurgency could do in Europe. Since the first world war when has a European country actually won a war? The only one I can think of is Finland. They basically won the winter war of 1939. Europeans can't fight for shit. Americans, Brits, Anglos and Russians have a history of doing the fighting for them.  Not a single army in Europe could clear out insurgents from even a single Islamic slum in any of their major cities. It takes time to mobilise artillery and air support. The spineless politicians would never allow it anyway. I doubt most countries in Europe could even secure their own military bases before they were overrun by insurgents. \n\nEurope is done for. The flag of the caliphate will fly over most of it. It's only a question of timing. ",

Basically when America was discovered it basically shook up the whole of Christendom, who based most of their geography and history on the classics and the Bible, and they couldn't believe there was an entire continent which had never been described in the Bible. They therefore had to come up with some explanation for it, and some decided it was the original site of the Garden of Eden, and others, especially the Puritans, believed it was the New Jerusalem offered by God in Revelation, and it was their mission to leave behind the sinful, fallen Europe and set up a perfect, Godly kingdom of believers in the New World, which would therefore bring about the events described in Revelation. A lot of these ideas fed into the American psyche, especially the idea that this land had been given to them by God, and thus you get all this Manifest Destiny stuff as a core part of US identity",

In 1967 the north was loosing soldiers faster than they could be replaced and then they mount a stunning offensive out of nowhere. They conducted 2 further offensives that year. That had supposedly all been stunning American victories. Only for them to continue fighting? The added bonus was that the north was able to supplant the uppity southern Vietcong leadership with northern stooges. The ARVN invaded Cambodia and Laos a few years later to destroy the NVA and Vietcong bases. Got slaughtered ran for their lives and declared victory even though their enemies were supposed to have been defeated 4 years earlier. Then there was the Easter offensive. Only failed because of massive American bombings. Concentrating more firepower on them than had ever been concentrated in battle in world war two.

A disgruntled and demorialised populace of which i'd say 30% are hostile to the west. Political correctness. A fanatical and well supplied enemy. Porous borders over which an enemy can easily operate undetected. Other counter insurgencies like those in Rhodesia, South Africa and Congo or the war in Yemen and Oman in the 60's and 70's won't be applicable to our experience.\n\nWhere have you fucking been? Every fucking week there is a terrorist attack somewhere in Europe. Events which would have been news of the decade in the 1990's come multiple times each summer. ITS ALREADY STARTED. If its this bad now what will it be like in 20 years when countries like France, Germany and Sweden are Muslim? When whites are a minority? \n\nFor a start, i guarantee you they will appropriate our property just like Mugabe seized the farms and how the ANC are seizing whites land by brutally killing them right now. We can also expect the complete breakdown of the electrical grid. Electricity will probably be 6 hours a day if we're lucky. The sewage systems will completely collapse as 3rd world migrants are to ignorant and bone idle to maintain anything. Cholera. I hear its great fun. We haven't had a major Cholera outbreak in Britain since 1866 so i wouldn't know. In lots of African countries people go out of their way to shit all over the place. HIV? Its a white colonial conspiracy. It can be cured with fruit juice. Just rape a virgin. That cures it. Cannibalism isn't uncommon in western Africa. That is all the best case scenario. \n\nFrance got their arses kicked out of Indochina. They lost at Dien Bein Phu. They spent years trying to put down an insurgency in their African colonies only to loose miserably. The experience in Afghanistan has shown that most European countries don't even want to fight. The British and Canadian armies went into Hellmand and Kandahar and were fighting for their lives while the soldiers of other countries sat round and drank beer or forbade their troops to fire a shot. In 2006 a Danish battle group was sent to reinforce the Paras in Musa Qaula as they were under siege and barely holding on. As soon as Danish politicians found out what the fighting was like they ordered their battle group to abandon the paras and run for their lives. Imagine that. ",

You don't need to be an economist to understand you can't give loans to poor people and expect it to be returned to you. Feel free to look into it yourself and look for scientific papers if it really interests you that much. I'm just trying to point out that this isn't some crackpot theory.",
