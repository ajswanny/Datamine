People don't think \"Oh, the Louvre doesn't have a King living in it, so what's the point in visiting it!\" Are people really suggesting that people are going to stop visiting Windsor Castle or The Tower of London or any other big historical landmark because we got rid of the Royal family?\n* Confuses Royal private property with the Crown Estate. The Crown Estate does NOT belong to the Royal family in the sense most people imagine. They can't just \"take it back\" - nor should they be able to. That would mean one family would own vast tracts of the country and all of its seabed just because their distant ancestors conquered it by force. That spits in the face of everything our modern democracy is supposed to stand for.\n\nTLDR: CGP Grey makes a shitty argument. ",

Personally I think its a much better system to have a separation between government and head of state, its a non-political figurehead that represents the country as opposed to a political leader with their own agenda. Presidents generally don't think along the lines of service above self, whereas the monarchy does. It's nice to be able to criticise the elected leader without them wrapping themselves in the Union Jack and saying \"you're unpatriotic if you criticise me\" as with the situation in the US. So as for merit, I'd personally say the Queen and the rest of the Royals have proven themselves consistently. Almost all members have served in the Armed Forces and beyond, done outstanding charity work (more so than any other person in the country I'd argue), and are fantastic ambassadors abroad, seeing how popular they are overseas. This on top of a whole host of economic benefits we get simply from their existence, I'd say that 62p per person is a pretty decent deal!",

Supporting a system of Constitutional Monarchy is a political position. To assume the Royal Family doesn't have an agenda is pretty naive. Just because we don't know what their agenda is, doesn't mean they don't have one. Anything that supports their own interests would be supporting their own agenda.\n\n>Presidents generally don't think along the lines of service above self, whereas the monarchy does. It's nice to be able to criticise the elected leader without them wrapping themselves in the Union Jack and saying \"you're unpatriotic if you criticise me\" \n\nWell it can be argued that its that selfishness thats a motivator to do what the electorate wants so they can be voted back in.\n\nIf your point was valid, why not get rid of all elected officials and go back to a system of nobles with all the power? Again this harks back to the previous point of assuming the Monarchy acts in a selfless way.  As for patriotism, its nigh on impossible to criticise the Monarchy without someone pulling the \"unpatriotic\" card, so it works both ways.\n\n> I'd personally say the Queen and the rest of the Royals have proven themselves consistently. . .\n\nI'd personally say they haven't, and do not represent the best of what the UK has to offer and do not make good ambassadors.\n\nHost of other economic benefits? What Tourism? This can be argued against too, but as you didn't elaborate I wont go into detail either.\n\nAs for 62p/person this has been shown to be false, and even if it were true it can be argued that this money would be better spent on more nurses, teachers or police officers.\n\nAt the end of the day the points you made focused on how you felt personally, which is fine of course, and which is essentially what monarchy depends on to survive in this day and age. \n\n\n",

And here in germany for example the president holds veto power given that he/she has to sign passed bills into effect and can deny the signature if they deem it unconstitutional which happens rarely (8 times in 69 years) but I think is valuable in a parliamentarian democracies where the governing majorty holds a lot of power.\n",

I feel like you are confusing 'head of state' with 'head of government'. Most countries have elected heads of state who represent the constitution of the nation *without* being directly involved with politics. Germany has a president too - Frank-Walter Steinmeier. Talk to any German. They can criticise their president freely and Germans don't assume they are somehow \"against Germany\".\n\n> Almost all members have served in the Armed Forces and beyond\n\n Sure, some of them (where did 'almost all' come from?) have been in the army and I respect them for their bravery, but so have literally tens of thousands of other men and women, and to a greater extent.\n\n>  done outstanding charity work (more so than any other person in the country I'd argue)\n\nYou're saying someone who is paid to go to charity events and cut ropes is somehow doing more work than someone who works with recovering drug addicts every day of their lives? Or deals with suicidal teens every day? Or goes to developing countries to help fight deadly diseases? My godfather's daughter went out to West Africa to work as a nurse during the height of the Ebola epidemic. You're saying that Kate or the Queen really is a better charity worker than people like her? Hell, it's not like they are even doing behind-the-scenes administration of charities - they get other people to do that for them. \n\n> I'd say that 62p per person is a pretty decent deal!\n\nThe CGP video is a load of wank, I've discussed it in another comment. \n\nThe Royal Family represent entrenched classism and elitism. It's literally saying \"some people are better and more deserving because of their birth.\" I'd rather have an freely elected position of monarch, which any British person could reach the office of out of their own merit, than something so antiegalitarian.
