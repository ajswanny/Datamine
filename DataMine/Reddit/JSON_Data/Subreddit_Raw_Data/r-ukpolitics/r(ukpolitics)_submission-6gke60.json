And the tallest villagers were able to help the most, because they loved the magic money tree for helping them to grow so big and strong.\n\nBut then some nasty financial advisors came to the village. And they stripped great handfuls of the magic money tree's leaves and fruit, and stole them away to plant new trees in Panama. And when they came back, they laughed at the magic money tree and said 'look, it's pathetic! There's not enough fruit left!' And the villagers were sad.\n\nAnd some soldiers came, and they ripped branches off the magic money tree, to use for their weapons. And they shouted at the villagers, and said 'WE NEED THESE BRANCHES TO KEEP YOU SAFE!'. And the villagers were sad, because they knew they were safer when the magic money tree actually worked properly. \n\nAnd the village governor came out, and she shook her head. After she'd given out great baskets of magic money tree fruit to her friends in America, and her friends in the Middle East, and her friends in the Bahamas, she shook her head, and she sighed, and she said 'I'm sorry, this tree is just not sustainable. You villagers will have to work harder. You will have to eat less fruit. Your shelter is not guaranteed. And the tallest villagers will have every Friday off, because the magic money tree will obviously grow faster if we stop nurturing it properly'. The governor laughed, and thanked the sad villagers, and she started walking back to her mansion.\n\nBut then one of the villagers stood up, and said 'ahem...wait a minute. This is OUR tree'.",

All important cities that are being forgotten by a service that's more about political point scoring than actual benefit for the economy. \n\nThen there is the impact of the route. Thousands of people are going to lose their homes because the route for the proposed service cuts through several built up areas. Those people will get bought out of their homes but what about the neighbouring areas? The values of their homes are likely to plummet. Living within spitting distance of the East Coast mainline (literally about 30ft from my front door) I know what constant train traffic does to house values. Put my house two streets away from the train line and the value goes up \u00a330,000.\n\nThe benefits of HS2 haven't really been sold either.

    "body": "From a post I wrote on another forum a few days ago (before the election):\n\nTheresa May served as Home Secretary for about six years before becoming Prime Minister. Throughout that time, on most days she probably spent several hours just reviewing cases where the police and security services wanted to do something that required explicit authorisation at that level.\n\nIt's reasonable to assume that many, even most, of those cases really did relate to the worst in our society. It also seems reasonable to assume that in at least some of those cases someone known to be very bad could not easily be brought to justice through our normal legal processes without undermining some other ongoing investigation. In addition, she was presumably given information and advice primarily by the police and security services, and those same organisations and the officials representing them would be the people either enabled or limited by her decisions.\n\nIt isn't hard to see how someone exposed to that pressure for such a sustained period of time would become extremely authoritarian. I don't know how anyone's view of society after such an experience could not be so biased that it would be hard to see what normal life looks like any more. Just about everyone who has become Home Secretary in my adult life has moved in that direction during their time in office.\n\nThe only difference here is that by a quirk of political fate Theresa May then became the most senior politician in the UK, with a majority government that gave her the power to drive through almost any legislation if she wanted it strongly enough. She achieved that position without anyone actually voting for that outcome in the first place. Until very recently, she also had little significant opposition to challenge her.\n\nAnd so here we are, with the Investigatory Powers Act on the books and a government whose most senior representatives don't seem to understand even the basics of modern technologies and their implications yet have little hesitation about proposing regulation or outright bans of some of that same technology if it makes them look strong to enough voters in the week before a general election.",

Not to mention talking all day with senior police etc. At least the PM looks at other shit by necessity and gets some perspective that not everybody is trying to kill you. Then you get into PM and you literally have the power to stop all that. Possibly she genuinely believes that its for the best if she's ignored all the advice from people on why it's a terrible idea. \n\n\nOf note Home office is generally a cursed position anyway I can't actually name any PMs who ever served as home office minister in the last 50 years. Churchill was involved in some home office-ish type role dealing with police or something and he was a bit of an authoritarian bastard as well he just happened to be about at the right time. (e.g look up Churchill and the Tonypandy riots). \n\n\nIf I'm honest  I'm actually kind of wondering if it's a real trend that all of our most recent successful PMs generally don't spend years clawing their way up through ministries in high visibility high profile roles. Thatcher was just education secretary and was pretty successful, blair was shadow home sec for 2 years till John smith died, Cameron was pretty much nothing before being leader of opposition. Meanwhile Major was a visible Chancellor and struggled like hell and was saved by the gulf war but was fucked by no majority, Brown was Chancellor and then PM for a couple years. May I think is going to go a similar way to Brown unless Trump starts a war (not impossible in fairness).",

    "body": "The fall in Indian exports were not caused by market manipulation, nor by high export tariffs, nor by lack of investment.\n\nIndia deindustrialized between 1750 and 1860 in two main epochs - both characterised by unique causes. The first epoch runs from about 1750 to 1810 and was an indirect result of the dissolution of the Mughal empire. The waning of central authority increased rents, regional sub-continental trade declined, revenue farming expanded and warfare raised the price of agricultural inputs. This had the effect of increasing grain prices, and thus nominal wages (as ordinary workers lived near subsistence). This increased the cost of manufactures, and thus hurt Indian exports.\nIn this period, India lost ground to Britain before Britain had even industrialised, and was still relying on cottage industry manufacturing.\nIn the second epoch, from between 1810 to 1860, the price of textiles fell world-wide due to the adoption of the factory system. This was felt more in India due to the growth of world transport links. \nIn this time, although Indian agriculture stopped its decline, and the relative stability of Company rule arrested the rise in grain prices, the relative price of grain continued to rise - thus further hurting exports. \n\nThis deindustrialisation was despite British investment, not because of a lack of it. The British retained Mughal levels of taxation, and as Ferguson notes - under British rule the after-tax income of villages actually doubled from 27% to 54%, with the area of irrigated land increasing by a factor of 8 (compared to 5% under the Mughals). This was paid for by \u00a3270 million in capital by the 1880s (20% of all British investment overseas). \nAs P. J. Marshall argues: the British regime didn\u2019t break with the traditional economy and control was largely retained by existing regional rulers.  \n\nIndia only ever turned a small profit for British businesses (P.J Cain).\n\nFinally, as Britain moved to a free trade doctrine in 1847 (despite the rest of the world retaining merchantilism), I would argue that in the latter half of the 19th Century, the country did less market manipulation than most developed nations.\n\nP.

To Bristol it's 183 miles and takes twice as long. It takes almost an hour to get from Liverpool to Manchester and it's only 30 bloody miles. There are loads more examples but you get the point. \n\nTrains from East to West are atrocious quality, constantly late or cancelled, more sparse, and take far longer, whereas the trains connecting London to the North are already by far the best. So a lot of people who say it benefits the North and would help create some kind of \"northern powerhouse\" are very disconnected with the North. It's better for the people to be able to actually travel short distances and back in the same day than cut a journey to London a bit. It's disingenuous to say HS2 is for the North when it's clearly still an idea to help out Londoners, and if it helps northerners a bit, fine. The North would benefit so much more from decent cross country rail than HS2.\n\nWhile I agree doing one doesn't mean they can't do the other, but when we all know they won't do anything about cross country rail it does smart a bit that they're ploughing so much money into making commuters to London's lives a bit easier.",
