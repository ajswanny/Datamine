One has more oil wealth ergo international influence.*\n\n***ISIL**(left):*\n\n* *contains foreign fighter(appearance like Jihadi John**, leather gun pouch - appropriated to westerners, knife as I'll explain below**)*\n* *supplied with western military equipment (boots **which are in good condition - wealthy/generous funding?, leather gun pouch again - it's of quality too, knife which looks more professional/guerilla'ry due to action cinema. I haven't actually got a clue where it's from, but like me, not many are versed in knifenomics or whatever we should call it**)*\n* *foreign hostage (political motive**, like you said below: \"Guantanamo\". It promotes an irony suggesting our/Anglospherical appreciation of both foreign and domestic hostages. After all, there is both the \"Guantanamo\" and \"Jihadi John\" elements to consider**)*\n* *hostage in Guantanamo style jumpsuit (political motive)*\n* ***like the Saudi side of the cartoon, I expect the illustrator to have made them so clearly white as to not stir racial relations or backlash. Making them white makes that element of their identify unnoticeable to the majority white audience. This cartoon is, of course, political. It isn't suppose to be much else.  It wasn't designed to be inflammatory though and not to be controversial. It was not intended to play on race and, as one of the benefits of that, was not designed to receive criticism. They are suppose to be indistinguishable in this manner. No racial associations. Anyway, it's good PR and gives no/unpopular reason or ammo for backlash. A perspective I don't endorse would be that this suggests ISIL makeup/training/manpower/origins or how they're an international player. I doubt it though. It doesn't seem deliberate in that manner and that also really strays from the, subjective I suppose, point of this cartoon. Though the polysemous nature of such cartoons and media in general allow it to be appreciated and approved of by wider, conflicting audiences.***\n\n***Saudi Arabia**(right):*\n\n* *Traditional dress & weapon (traditional, status quo?**, this promotes an element of culture, it doesn't feed the \"product of Western foreign policy\" narrative and instead suggests that this is who they are, yet we side with them. The long sword also makes it feel ritualistic and personal suggesting historical roots/a matter of tradition. The cartoon is recognising recognition, so to speak**)*\n* *Larger weapon(more aggressive, greater threat**, established authority/threat, it doesn't seem like an in the moment military operation. Instead a passive sport.**)\n* *Native hostage (repressive regime, acts against its own people**, identifies the perpetrator: an idea of authority - assumed government - further stressed by the flag in the background and the classical checkered tea towel looking headscarf established by press on Saudi Arabian authority)***\n* *hostage posture (downtrodden, oppression**, the man appearing demoralised possibly suggests this not being a new threat, maybe that Cameron's actions are knee jerky and that even after so long: Why hasn't Dave approached Saudi Arabia when, in comparison, having given so much time? It plays on both extremes**)*\n* ***The nose seems to play with the wealth/nasty bankers/liar stereotypes and association. One may say that it is just a quirk of cartoonish exaggeration, but it isn't applied indiscriminately. There's already, on the others, a milder exaggeration of this for which I'll suspect is for cartoony vibes.***\n* ***I think a similarity to stress is that of the background. It is, despite the split in the middle, almost a continuation of the same image. A few clashes in colourings here and there, but they quite literally share common ground. By the looks of it anyway.***\n* ***The symbol/sword in the flag, just beneath the held one in perspective, associates the picture. It suggests national policy. It gives credibility to the cartoon at face value being the actual flag of Saudi Arabia. Suggests an official capacity.***\n\n*What is in a name our government give to people when the actions on the ground don't add up? :/*\n\nForgive me for not having structured or condensed my words well. It would take too long now. I wouldn't want to discourage any response you may have. I would've posted some hours back, but neighbours and food got in the way. I hope it was a decent read and thank you for providing me with an opportunity to spill thought. Also, forgive any misproofreadings. I have a lot of time to waste.\n\n**Ninja Edit:** I don't understand the karma you received",

On the white hostage, though my paper would just indicate a foreign person, the political message might be as you say.  The nose is a good point, Osbourne definitely gets the nose of the wealthy establishment in cartoons.  The background, I was thinking that as well but didn't put into words.  The symbolism of the flag and the parallel with the context is interesting.  Food for thought that highlights how clever political cartoonists can be with their work.  Thank you for your thoughts!\n\nI wouldn't worry about the Karma, I'm being bullied by some left wing authoritarians.
