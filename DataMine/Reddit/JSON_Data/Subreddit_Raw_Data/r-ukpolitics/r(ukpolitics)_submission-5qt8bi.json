That's not as sensational a headline, but the Independent and Westmonster will of course report it like that.\n\nIt's also not a \"Muslim ban\", it's officially a country ban. It's clearly a progression of his \"ban Muslims\" statements during his campaign, but officially it's a country ban.\n\nSo, from the Indy headline, \"ban\" was not used by Corbyn, and the word \"muslim\" isn't even contained anywhere inside the Executive Order: https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/27/donald-trump-executive-order-immigration-full-text\n\nPersonally, I'd be very happy to postpone a Trump visit. His EO is fucking outrageous.\n\n> Peston: do you think we should rescind the invitation, do you think we should cancel the state visit.\n\n> ...\n\n> Corbyn:  we should make it very clear that we are extremely upset about it and it would be totally wrong for him to be coming here while this is going on. I think he has to be challenged on this because it's a freedom  [interrupted by Peston]\n\n> Peston: Until that ban is lifted you don't think he should come here?\n\n> Corbyn: I'm not happy with him coming here until that ban is lifted quite honestly because look at what's happening with those countries, how many more is it going to be, and what's going to be the long term effect on this on the rest of the world.\n\n[Source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2EA8B__PX0)\n\nI'm also very disappointed that the FCO hasn't yet issued travel advice for UK citizens who will want to (re-)enter the USA and also have a passport from the affected countries. The USA deserves no special exceptions; the FCO would (should) be quick to issue advice regardless of whether the country concerned is a current ally.",

This excuse would be completely compatible with his political base, but also means the other countries in the West get what they want; the preservation of access for their own citizens, as well as allowing representatives from the target nations to visit America by transiting via third party countries.\n\nAllowing diplomatic opponents to change policy to accommodate our own wishes while not losing face is always the goal of foreign policy; everyone can win.",

Just the processing of refugees already in the pipeline. From one specific country. Based on specific evidence of a couple of people with terrorist ties slipping through the cracks (who were then later found and arrested).\n\n>The processing of refugees takes 12-18 months in many cases, as the bureaucratic process involved in vetting applicants takes time. Upon learning of the potential flaw in the system, Obama delayed processing any more refugees for a few months until the mistakes could be identified and corrected...then resumed the processing.\n\n>So, to be clear, Obama simply delayed admitting new Iraqi refugees to the US temporarily. Nobody who simply wanted to travel to the US and had obtained a tourist or work visa was blocked. Nobody who was already previously admitted on a visa was denied entry. No green card holders who happened to have some Iraqi ancestry were blocked. No refugee who had already been fully vetted and admitted to the US was affected. Certainly not people who were already en route.\n\n>THAT is how it is different. So completely different.",

But that shouldn't be mistaken for widespread support of his policies. He got roughly 26% of the votes from eligible voters. He got the right number of votes in the right places to get elected. \n\nThe ban Trump put in place is misguided and frankly dodgy since his list of places to be banned doesn't include, for example, Saudi Arabia, where the 9/11 terrorists came from. He also said that Christian refugees would be treated differently. \n\nDodginess:\n\nhttp://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/trump-muslim-ban-excludes-countries-linked-businesses-article-1.2957956\n\nChristians:\n\nhttp://thehill.com/homenews/administration/316586-trump-persecuted-christian-refugees-are-priority\n\nPeople can agree or disagree with the ban.

There was something to the email, and we'll get to it in a minute, but first let's address a few misconceptions. First of all, **there is no \"Dr. Lawrence Britt.\"** The author of the 14-point fascism inventory, Laurence Britt, is **a former corporate executive** who wrote and published a dystopian novel about right-wing extremism, titled June 2004, during the height of the Lewinsky scandal. That is, to the best of my knowledge, his only published volume.\n\nIt's sad that whenever any comparisons to fascism are made, those definitions are bandied around as gospel and people don't bother looking into proper academic work by Paxton or Payne, etc.\n\n",

All these **share the analysis that the current order of society stems from its economic system, capitalism, that in this system, there are two major social classes: the working class\u2014who must work to survive, and who make up the majority within society\u2014and the capitalist class\u2014a minority who derives profit from employing the working class, through private ownership of the means of production**, and that conflict between these two classes will trigger a revolution. The primary element which will enable this transformation, according to this analysis, is the **social ownership of the means of production.**\n\nOooh look, I've cherry picked bits of the definition of Communism that Jeremy Corbyn agrees with, therefore he's a Communist!
