Sinn Fein still have a long way to go, but they have mostly moved on from the troubles of the past in terms of any violence.That said Sinn Fien are still backwards morons...its just that the DUP is much much worse.\n\nDUP threaten violence every other day, and have made NO effort to stand back from their extremist policies of the past. The DUP openly supported terrorism, aided by the British government, and if they saw a need for it they would support terrorism on the citizens of Northern Ireland tomorrow. Whatever helps them keep the crown given to them by the British establishment.\n\nThe British government always had close ties with Loyalist paramilitary groups in Northern Ireland though. The Army/MI5 DUP UDA and UVF frequently took part in joint operations...so at least there is a history of corporation.\n\nIts embarrassing that certain neighborhoods in Northern Ireland can't get their heads out of the past and keep voting in these disgusting human beings because they 'hate the other side'. \n\nThe part of me that just wants to see the world burn is happy though.",

Areas in the south and west with strong Catholic/nationalist majorities would be handed over to the Republic, and those Catholics left stranded in the \"Protestant state\" would be \"expelled, nullified, or interned\".[73] The story was printed in The Sunday Independent newspaper on 16 January.[74] The \"doomsday plan\" was based on the work of Dr Liam Kennedy, a lecturer at Queen's University Belfast[73] who in 1986 had published a book called Two Ulsters: A Case for Repartition although it did not call for ethnic cleansing. The UDP's Raymond Smallwoods said \"I wasn't consulted but the scenario set out is a perfectly plausible one\".[73] The **DUP's Sammy Wilson stated that the plan \"shows that some loyalist paramilitaries are looking ahead and contemplating what needs to be done to maintain our separate Ulster identity\"**[73]",

All of this is going to fall on May, and the idea of the Tories being the party of economic competency will continue to fall apart.\n\nIn ordinary circumstances, I would've loved a Labour government, but as it turns out, they get to sit on the sidelines for a few more years while the Conservatives deal with these monumental fuck-ups all of their own doing, and the coalition of chaos with terrorist sympathisers makes it all the more sweeter.\n\nLabour would've won this election if the PLP had been united from the start. As it turns out, the result has worked in their favour, but hopefully they now get fully behind Corbyn because in a complete twist from 3 months ago, the next election is now theirs to lose.",

He knew his party would take a huge hit in popularity and himself, personally, and he could have equally propped up Labour and kept them in power which would have likely allowed him to get more of his policies through and pander to his base somewhat. I think the coalition government was a rare period of stability for the country in recent years and one of the reasons David Cameron won a majority in 2015 but that came at huge expense to the lib dems. \n\nThis coalition is not in the national interest and is purely so the conservatives can cling to power after an election they called out of pure opportunism and self interest in the wake of a referendum they enacted to solve an internal party conflict after using the \"EU referendum\" as a vote winner in 2015 that they never expected to lose. They've done great damage to our country over the past 2 years through party power conflicts and selfish opportunism and I think that is a stark contrast to Clegg's decision to go in to coalition in 2010 to offer this nation some stability during a difficult period that he's ultimately paid hard for..",

So the question of whether someone was involved or to what extent they were involved is kind of redundant. \n\nOnce they become involved outside that context, though, it becomes a very significant issue. In the UK parliament less so, because Sinn F\u00e9in abstain from voting and the DUP are a small party which until now has been lacking in political clout. But in the Irish republic, the associations between those militant branches and the political parties is a big concern. Gerry Adams insistences that he was not a member of the IRA and that he doesn't know where the bodies are buried has practically reached meme status. There's also a large contingent of people (myself included) who have serious reservations about voting Sinn F\u00e9in -- despite agreeable policy manifestos -- due to associations with the IRA and organised crime in general. A lot of us, frankly, are waiting for the old guard to die off. ",

But the select few that still cling to him like flies on shit are truly cultists in every sense of the word. \n\nWhat elected Trump was ignorance, hate, stupidity among the poor, party over country, swindling, and a collective hatred of Clinton. \n\nWhat caused this? \n\nThe Republican National Convention (RNC) and the Democratic National Convention (DNC) produced two terrible candidates, despite verifiable proof of collusion between the candidates and the high management of each convention.\n\nHillary won the primaries because she colluded with Debbie Wasserman-Schultz (leader of DNC) to overthrow the ACTUALLY more popular Bernie Sanders. Nobody with a good moral compass or a brain would've voted for her if Bernie have been given an equal chance. \n\nTrump won the primaries because he bullied the other republican candidates and bolstered himself to the top with his money and favorability among the RNC. This isn't including Russia's involvement, either. Also, Hillary had also helped Trump beat his contenders (willfully, I might add), because she thought that by making him the RNC's front runner, she wouldn't have any problem beating him in the general election. She underestimated his popularity among the Republican citizens of the country (of which Trump secured due to cons, lies, and a party-over-country-holier-than-thou mentality among the other reasons listed above). They believed because he ran a successful business (which is ironic as he has been bankrupted multiple times) he could run a country like a business as well. \n\nThe main problem with the US election is that we have been exposed to the inner-workings of politics on a level we haven't seen before. What we have seen is that the process is full of utter immoral bullshit (and we're angry that it seems that they've been doing this all along, they just got caught red handed this time). We are also VERY PISSED that Bernie didn't win the primaries (which he lost, albeit unfairly WITH PROOF OF THE DNC WORKING WITH HILLARY TO END HIM). \n\nBut at the end, what hurts the most, is that the entire country knows (or has just come to realize if we include the Trump regretters) that Bernie Sanders would have won by a massive, MASSIVE landslide with Trump as his competition. \n\n*edit: clarifications, misspelled word, and a missing . and ,.

    "body": "Unfortunately in Ireland it's never easy to know where to start the clock. Should we start it in 1969, when the Troubles began? More like 1169, when Strongbow first arrived in Ireland. \n\nFor the roots of the modern conflict you've got to go back a hundred years. In 1914 Home Rule was promised for Ireland, it was all democratically voted for via the Westminster government and above board. At that point some Unionists in the north began to import arms, caches of rifles, which they got from Germany (this was in the spring of 1914 just prior to the First World War) and the British Army in Ireland mutinied and let it be known that they were not going to enforce this law, which had been democratically voted on. The armed Protestant force in the north was the original Ulster Volunteer Force. (The IRA did not emerge until after the war).\n\nThen war broke out and the Irish were told that Home Rule would be postponed until after the war, but certain elements were impatient and carried out an armed uprising in Dublin in 1916, brutally repressed by the British, which won the Republican cause more sympathy. \n\nAfter the war there ensued an Irish civil war which led eventually to the partition of Ireland in 1922, with much gerrymandering in Ulster to ensure a (perhaps spurious) Protestant majority in the six counties of Ulster. Low level conflict continued in the North until full scale civil strife broke out once again in 1969.\n\nThe things to note about this is that Home Rule had been democratically achieved after generations of work within the Westminster system, and it was overturned by Protestant paramilitary groups in the north importing arms, and elements within the British Army who simply stated that they would not enforce the law. This is crucial to an understanding of the origin of the conflict. More than anything else it was what pushed republicans in the north and south into the path of armed struggle as a response.",
