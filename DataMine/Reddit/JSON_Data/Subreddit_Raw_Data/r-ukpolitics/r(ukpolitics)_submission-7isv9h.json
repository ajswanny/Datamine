    "body": "This is probably the most bizarre example of someone doing something extremely undemocratic in the name of democracy.\n\nThe whole point of Pro-EU MPs is to represent the views of the 48% of the UK who voted Remain, and also to remind us that the a central point of a democracy is that people change their mind on how they vote depending on the circumstances and how the consequences of the vote are doing. This is why we have elections every few years instead of just having one election in the 18th Century and leaving that party in power forever.\n\nAlso, this guy-- for all his rhetoric of saving democracy-- should understand that another central premise to a democracy is that people who aren't part of the majority opinion still get represented. You don't just clear all the Labour, Lib Dem etc MPs out of Westminster because the Tories won the most seats.\n\nThe only thing that irritates me is MPs who don't base their policies on the EU on the way their constituents voted. This is especially bad in Wales where the majority of MPs in Westminster / AMs in the Senedd support remaining despite 70%+ their constituents supporting Leave. I don't support Leaving but it must be vexing to have your paid representative not actually representing you. ",

It\u2019s shocking how many upvotes comments like that manage to get. Majority of folk are decent and wise enough to see through it but on the other hand there\u2019s a growing number of people who actually believe that crap. We work and live with all sorts of people but wonder what personal opinions they hold. \nFair enough people having opinions on something but unfortunately some hold non factual opinions as gospel.  This in turn translates to the rise of lunatics as we currently see in the World now. \nTechnology was meant to help the human kind but it will also be the downfall of the human race as it\u2019s so easily manipulated and spread about delivered straight to your fingertips in form of \u201cfake news\u201d.",

Journalist John Simpson, in a book on journalism, suggested that Rothermere was referring to the violence against Jews and Communists rather than the detention of political prisoners.[40][page needed]\n\nRothermere and the Mail were also editorially sympathetic to Oswald Mosley and the British Union of Fascists.[41] Rothermere wrote an article titled \"Hurrah for the Blackshirts\" in January 1934, praising Mosley for his \"sound, commonsense, Conservative doctrine\",[42] and pointing out that: \"Young men may join the British Union of Fascists by writing to the Headquarters, King's Road, Chelsea, London, S.W.\"[43]\n\nThe Spectator condemned Rothermere's article commenting that, \"... the Blackshirts, like the Daily Mail, appeal to people unaccustomed to thinking. **The average Daily Mail reader is a potential Blackshirt ready made.

How far do you take that however is an interesting dilemma for those mps. Completely different example of course but say a constituency had a majority demanding the ban of gay marriage, I wouldn't look down on the mp who refused that. Its a slippery slope of thinking though when an mp thinks he knows better than the constituency, for the constituency, and I agree with you wholeheartedly, and yet sometimes I wonder what might have happened in our recent history if we had a bit more balls in parliament and less image preservation.

Some percentage wanted softer options... Others wanted no relationship with Europe... Others hadn't considered that there were options. It irritates me hugely when people like Farage say \"the British people voted for X or Y\", when in reality, the referendum didn't collect that data.",

I think that using Whips is a poor corruption of democratic values because it's policymaking from the top down. Power is handed to MPs (and therefore the head of state) by the people. Philosophically, a prime minister has no power: they are given their position by the people with power-- the people-- and should effectively serve to represent their nation as best as possible on the international stage whilst the MPs do all the actual decision making.\n\nOf course, such a system would make policymaking a complicated mess, but hey, that's democracy for you.

The right will whine that they're being forced to be Politically Correct by dictators from the left while the Left will cry they're being oppressed for not having a safe space. Everyone has an opinion and a view but rarely do they truly line up with reality all the time.\n\n\nThe poster talked about by the OP feels so disenfranchised that he feels that only an extreme measure will ensure his view is respected. Not saying it is correct but it's important that we realise that Brexit came from years of government failure to make people feel engaged and interested. The population mistrusts the British government, as it should because we've suffered self serving authoritarian government that doesn't understand the things it governs, and that mistrust intensifies when you're talking about an organisation that is not accountable to the general population of the UK. Combine this with the discontent from a stagnant market that no longer felt worth calling safe and excessive austerity that has seen major decline in the average person's lifestyle and stability. Then further combine this with political wars in foreign countries forcing people to seek asylum which is then hijacked by economic migrants once over generous announcements are made by the non accountable organisation, all while we're still seeing terrorism which has been ongoing for decades from one country/group or another, from the IRA to Islamist we've seen terrorism, I'm nearly 30 and through my entire life there has been terrorism from one or the other. We have had terrorism on and off for 50 years easily. \n\n\n\n\nI'm not saying it's right to kill all MPs, I'm not saying Brexit was the right answer. I'm not saying that Remain was right nor that the Leave is responsible for the death of an MP - that's disingenuous deceit.  I'm simply pointing out that so much has worked as kindling to stoke the fires that lead us to this point. The obsession with in fighting of us vs them politics and disgraceful vile media using the fuel of genuine problems during times of degrading quality has made most people feel that Democracy isn't working. Those that vote for change don't see it happen enough and those that vote for the status quo see too much change happening.\n\n\n\nNow more than ever do we need to find middle ground. We don't want to become anything like America, we need to stop the Americanisms growing in our politics and culture. We don't have a 2 party system, we don't have such blatant corruption, we need to start acting on this. Politicians that are moderate need to speak up, stop letting the Far Right and the Far Left hold the mic to their arses and fart whatever shit they please. No more bollocks of it being either total integration or total separation. Now is the time we need to remember that Democracy works best with compromise and compassion, a more moderate behaviour. ",

You'd be hard pressed to find a single native community prepared to turn a blind eye to child pimping (I'm not saying there are absolutely none), yet the uncomfortable truth the sheer numbers display is that there are clearly Muslim communities where this behavior is at least tolerated. Likewise you'll have to look bloody hard to find a native British community or religious leader telling youth to go for the 'young white whores' yet there's a fair few Mosques where this is reported to happen. \n\nI'm afraid it is thousands. Listen to the poor white communities, and look at the scale of the grooming gang cases. Remember as well that those are just the ones where reports have been made and convictions are secured; any woman's rights campaigner will be able to tell you how many rapes actually happen compared to the number reported, and how many reports are made that never lead to convictions.\n\nI do get your point though; it's fucked up how little society cares about child grooming and it's annoying that so many people only care when it's a Muslim doing the grooming. Child grooming sentences should be up there with murder IMO. Disgusts me how many child rapists are out of prison within a decade. If you rape or groom a child then you shouldn't be getting out of prison untill you are far too old to be any threat, and maybe not even then. Any organized child pimping ring should be considered a national disgrace, whoever the perpetrators are.",

I think it is more that we pretend it is because we don't want to look too closely in our own communities, and we don't look closely enough into Muslim communities.\n\nIn terms of the Rotherham grooming stuff, for example, it was \"Pakistani-heritage community\" groups complaining about it and trying to raise the issue well before anyone outside was - the community wasn't tolerating it. They just couldn't do anything about it because they didn't have the power. But from the outside we pretend that they did tolerate it and it was their problem because that's easier than dealing with our failings, corruption and incompetence etc..\n\nIt's related to why some people talk about \"Asian\" people, others \"Muslims\", others then get upset and insist that it is \"Pakistani\" people and then others narrow it down further; if you are \"Asian\" but not \"Muslim\" you'll care about narrowing it down to Muslim. If you're Asian and Muslim but not Pakistani, you'll want to make that distinction; it's all about drawing the net wide enough to carry as many of the people as possible, while making it narrow enough to not cover you.
