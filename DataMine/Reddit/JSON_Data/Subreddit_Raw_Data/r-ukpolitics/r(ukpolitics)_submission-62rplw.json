Are you really trying to argue that Scots are unable to perceive who is acting in thier best interests? \n\nHey, I know, let's ask the last Tory PM, David \"I don't care about Scotland, that's Labour's problem\" Cameron? Or go further back to testing unpopular taxes on Scotland? Heck, there's a whole list but I won't bother as you'll just dismiss them as \"grievances\" - a magical word which somehow Tories think should make every complaint invalid.\n\nYou risk making yourself look ridiculous if you are actually trying to seriously argue the Conservatives have been looking out for Scotland's interests. Scotland does not like the Tories. They don't like us. They certainly aren't getting many votes out of us which is all that matters to them.\n\nAlso amusing that you think everyone to the left hardcore neoliberal capitalism with a side order of austerity is unforgivable socialism.
