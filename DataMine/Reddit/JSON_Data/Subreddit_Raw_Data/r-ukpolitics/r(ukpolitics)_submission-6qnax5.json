In this case, the status of worker shall be retained for no less than six\nmonths;\n\n>(d) he/she embarks on vocational training. Unless he/she is involuntarily unemployed, the\nretention of the status of worker shall require the training to be related to the previous\nemployment\n\n\nSo, to clarify - anyone who completes any short-term contract, or who is made unemployed and then registers at the unemployment office gets another 6 months (minimum) before they are eligible to be kicked out.  If they go on training courses as recommended by the Job Centre, then they get to stay even longer...\n\nThat is why the EU regulations don't solve the problem - because it isn't \"work or leave\", is it?  It isn't 'freedom of movement of workers' - it is 'freedom of movement of workers or potential workers'.\n",

    "body": "that EU directive is only about repatriate EU migrants who've failed to get a job after 3 months\n\nBelieve it or not, the anger against EU immigration isn't because they are coming here to be unemployed (save gypsy beggars and habitual criminals), the anger is they come to work, and because most EU migrants come from low wage/high unemployment countries, they are willing to work for less than the going rate that a Brit considers reasonable to live and raise a family on\n\ncan't the left/progressives get this? Can't they realise that an influx of foreign workers/labour force makes pay and working conditions worse, because workers negotiating power goes south if 'there are always enough desperate Eastern Europeans willing to do your job' (as was told to me)\n\nreally, I just don't see whats wrong with a managed work quota based migration system. A second issue that causes anger is migrants don't really spend money in their local economy, they send it home/take it home when they finished working. For example, you never see Eastern Europeans drinking in pubs, because they drink cans of lager on park benches. And a British workers whose income has suffered from migration can't afford to go to the pub anymore. So pubs, cafes, cinemas, small businesses loses out.",

And yet you have the nerve to complain that people who want to work are allowed to stay? LOL.",

Only offering fixed term contracts for loyal staff. Responding \"we can always replace you\" when asking for a pay increase, changes to work rota, honouring the job description or just saying it out of the blue to \"motivate\". Cash in hand. Understaffing. Giving additional responsibilities without additional pay. Having pointless roles like\"team leader in training\" although when an actual role opens, the team leader is hired from elsewhere due to more relevant experience. \n\nIf it was only due to immigrants willingness to work under poor condition which caused this, the job market in Norway would be far wurse, but it is not. When the unions and the miners strike failed, the British worker did not just loose the battle, but the war. All the insecureness and shortminded perspective the employers dictate the job security of the staff. If there was better rights for employees through law and unions or industry associations, the cost of hiring, training, and firing would be much more significant and employers would be more picky when recruiting and try harder to retain good loyal staff.",

What do you think the impact will be on our demographics and public services by reducing the proportion of young, healthy and economically active people in this country? Simply put, it will increase the economic burden on the younger generations and we'll need to [find a ways of paying for it.]( https://twitter.com/Peston/status/887662391227559937)\n\n5). [According to a former Downing Street aide](https://www.politicshome.com/news/uk/home-affairs/immigration/news/80066/government-had-no-hard-evidence-migration-pressure), when Cameron tried to renegotiate free movement with the Commission, the UK government couldn\u2019t provide any data showing any substantive problems with immigrants; they even asked \u2018MigrationWatch\u2019 to provide data and all they could come up with was a folder of press clippings about the immigration impact on a hospital here or a school there \u2013 no hard data. All the problems which were being ascribed to immigrants were just caused by UK level policy \u2013 as the Commission pointed out to Cameron. And Cameron himself admitted that the immigration \u201cproblem\u201d he had to solve was a cultural one and not an economic or services one.\n\nSo, immigrants are, [as usual,](https://twitter.com/PickardJE/status/777567811627577344) just a scapegoat for the failings of the British government. You have been sold, as Lord Heseltine put it, a \"deceitful pup\" and have in fact voted for a scenario which will make the poor even poorer and will put our public services under further strain. But, I guess we\u2019ll retreat back to the \u201cyou can\u2019t put a price on sovereignty\u201d position; at least until British judges in British courts uphold British parliamentary sovereignty, then they\u2019re \u201cenemies of the people\u201d, or \u201csaboteurs who need to be crushed.\u201d",

So (roughly) if a Brit could claim a benefit, an EU citizen with the right to remain (as established by the directive) could do too.  \n\nThat creates the situation where people on low (or no) incomes can claim welfare support, so they get to stay, even if they are not working.  (See category b in the last list).\n\nNow, if we were to reform the welfare rules, and make claiming benefits harder, that would make it harder for EU migrants on low incomes to stay - and even though we couldn't force their deportation, we would reduce long-term immigration naturally.

    "body": " You seem interested so I'll elaborate for you. Also I'm going to split immigrants into skilled and low skilled when I write. To separate lets say farm workers, cleaners etc from Doctors, Plumbers, Nurses. \n\n\n>If you try to send back the employed ones, you'll get back all the millions of retirees.\n\n\nI don't see the correlation here, why would nations want to send back retirees who get their money from pensions + uk Gov. No Eu nation has any interest in sending back retirees so this is a non point.\n\n\n>Not even talking about the positions no one would fill.\n\n\nMost of these manual jobs that we need large numbers of unskilled immigrants to fill will disappear in the next 25 years. Due to the nature of the Uk welfare state, (Free Healthcare, Schools etc) If we want to maintain this system we cannot burden ourselves with large amount of low skill workers now. Therefor for these jobs work visa's for Eu non skilled workers would work much better. \n\n> the numbers clearly state that this is a huge loss for workers, tax payers, elders and most of all the students and the youth.\n\n\nThey Don't really.  Low skill Uk born workers can expect an increase in wages. As there will be less supply of this labour. This will allow them to more effectively bargin for higher wages through unions.  Bank of England study estimated low skilled workers experienced a 5% wage drop per 100,000 new workers into an area. This has hurt these people over time.\n\n\n\nTax payers. Some tax revenue will be lost from the lower amount of unskilled workers. However this will also reduce the longterm costs to Hospitles,Schools etc. As there will be less people coming to the country to set up familys.\n\n\nElders. You are right about this one we need more care workers , we should incentivse these people to come in the new migration system. However current Eu membership has not solved this problem mainly due to goverment incompetence with wages and  conditions. \n\n\nStudents and the Youth. This one is bollocks. To be frank. Less than half of 1% study in the Eu over the corse of thier degree. Even Fewer go to work their during their career.  This is a right only used by elite students and workers who will qualify for Visa's anyway post Eu due to thier high skilled nature. Also Travle Visa's are pretty easy for the Rest of the world, so should be same for post brexit Europe.\n\n\n\n> Another question would be how is the immigration from former colonies like India?\n\n\nThey go through normal Migration system. With Wealth/skill requirements. They get a priority over non former colonies nations. Especially for unskilled. My town is mostly Indian and they tend to have an easy time getting in(Slow process though). But of corse much harder than if they where from Eu.\n\n\n>Will you keep the regulations for holiday and work hours?\n\n\nAccording to current government , Yes.\n\n\n> Is there a plan on how to finance northern Ireland? Since the EU money will stop to flow there.\n\n\n\nThey just got a major boost in funding somewhere around 20%. Although there is still debate as to weather to fund places, the Eu used to fund like wales.\n\n\n\n> How about the companies depending on continental shipping like all car manufacturers?\n\n\nWe will have to see, it depends how negotiations go. Hopefully It should be fine. If Eu and Uk are sensible.\n\n\n> What's with ESA and Erasmus?\n\n\nEsa. Is gonna be the same according to current gov. Eramus - as I said above less than half of 1% use is so ... meh. Would be nice if it could stay but , its not as important as democracy. \n\n\n> Who will replace the polish workers if 96% of the population are already employed?\n\n\nThat Stat uses dodgy maths that takes millions of people off the unemployment stats who are long term unemployed or not seeking work. Also Short term Work Visa's. But some poles ( a controlled amount) especially skilled would be allowed to come and stay. \n\n\n> This whole thing seems like a unplanned child\n\n\nEven if leaving the Eu will have many negatives, democracy is at the heart of Why I want to leave. I cannot accept the undemocratic nature of the EU. Along with this the Uk is the Worlds 5th largest economy, so I think we can survive without the Eu where maybe Austria as it is smaller could not. Also due to the Uk being such a big economy not many in the Uk use the Freedom of movement to work/learn in other countries. I think the Negatives are exaggerated. Sorry if this is sloppily written, I was rushed as I have other things to do today XD. Feel Free to ask any other questions or respond to my Answers\n\n\n",

That's not how it is in the UK.  We are almost 50% working class.  The working class are happy to accept manual work, and most of them had always planned on doing so.

The people in charge most definitely do not have the best interests of the 'common worker' at heart! They've shown that time and time again.\n\n\nFWIW, I base my assumption re low-skill immigration / low-skill wages on a report commissioned from the HO which found that unchecked economic migration had no effect on median- to high-skill wages, but a 'slight' downward pressure on low-skill wages. I combined that with my own personal experience of trying to find agency work a couple of years back, purely to earn a bit of extra cash, and finding myself repeatedly passed over. I work bloomin' hard whenever I work for an employer whether agency or not, I've got a lot of work experience; meanwhile there was a steady flow of eastern europeans, who in most cases simply copied the answers to the maths / English from their more fluent neighbours or myself, who walked in and then out with a job. I didn't want to assume that there was anything particularly scurrilous going on, but I thought it odd they were happy to employ people who didn't meet the criteria set by the employers, but not someone who did. Only the agency staff know the answer as to why that was!\n\n\nThe above probably reads like a bitter diatribe, I don't begrudge anyone who comes here for a better life; if I had the option to move to a country with a higher wage etc I'd grab it with both hands!

Either the labour moves or the employers move. If we close our borders, the employers simply move to where the cheaper labour is, our economy tanks and we become poorer. This is why we have to balance immigration and economic growth. \n\nBeing in the EU means that we are trading with a block of countries with a similar standard of living to us and a block that imposes laws to protect basic workers rights and public health. Polish workers may work for less than us, but Indian workers will work for way, way less. \n\nI don't know if you are aware of this, but the Indian government are already pressing for greater immigration access to the UK ahead of a trade deal. Add to this the fact that the government has explicitly stated, since the referendum, that they do not expect immigration to fall following brexit.\n\nWhat about the USA? A trade deal between the US and the EU recently failed because the US wanted a clause allowing corporations to be able to sue governments for enacting legislation that impacted their profits (think minimum wage, nationalised health care). European countries rejected this because they wanted to be in a position to enact their own laws to protect their own citizens. The EU is a large enough market that it had the clout to stand up to the USA and to huge international corporations in negotiating trade deals. \n\nThe UK on it's own will be in a much weaker position to protect wages and workers rights in negotiations. Add to this a conservative government which is openly hostile to regulation. \n\nIf you are genuinely concerned about low wages (and I'm sure you are) you need to join a trade union. I think that leaving an organisation that explicitly protects workers rights, public health and minimum wages, will spectacularly backfire. \n\n\n\n",

The directive shows that EU immigrants who are not willing to support themselves can be deported. Therefore 'no control' is false. It also disproves the myth peddled for years by the tabloid press that there is problem with 'benefit tourism' from the EU. Apparently not true.\n\nThe article disproves one lie out of many that were used to mislead the British public. For the other lies, see the other articles.
