But the past commitments of being part of the EU cannot and should not be erased by leaving the EU. And it is not hypocritical at all to take the pension that you worked for even if you did not want to be a member of the EU.\n\nIt is irrelevant whether he wanted to be part of the EU (which enabled his pension) because we were part of the EU. I really think people are missing the point here but cannot say I am surprised at all because this reddit generally trends towards reactions to people they hate rather than actually thinking about things more critically. \n\nA pension is essentially an extension of a salary that is delayed. If none of you have worked or gathered a pension then I understand why you would not realise this. He worked as an MEP so he deserves to be paid for his work as is a basic liberal principle and if you disagree with this then well.....",

And don't even get me started on the fact that many, many families are going to suffer because of the idiotic Brexit that he helped bring about, but of course old St Nigey isn't willing to suffer at all for a Brexit he only backed for ideological reasons and lower taxes. It honestly blows my mind that anyone listened to this chinless toad in the first place. Nearly identical background to David Cameron and people actually expected him to be some sort of champion of the people? It's the most frustrating thing to me about people's attitude to politics in this country - when it comes to right wing politicians people are trusting and naive as anything, but when it comes to left wing politicians you'd think we were still in a red scare. For example, discrediting a right wing politician pretty much takes pedophilia, rape, or something morally equivalent. You can discredit a left wing politician with any old shit (see Ed Miliband's bacon roll incident and the attacks on Corbyn's fashion sense when he first became party leader). You don't have to be left wing yourself to see the double standard. Granted, it seems to be starting to change, but it's a damn shame that it took one of the (if not *the*) most irreversible and politically self-injurious decisions we've ever made to make it happen.",

Just putting out an opposing sound-byte as balance. Reporting the story and what people are saying, but offering no additional information. No tools for people to decide if what someone says is true. No facts.\n\n\"Balance\" has gone so far that the BBC cannot seem to independently decide to report an objective fact. They need to find an expert or opposing politician to state it. This means people see both and chose a side.\n\nNot long ago the BBC would actually state it's own opinion on a subject, which people would often believe. Because the BBC required proof for it's opinion.\n\n\"Balance\" has been used to reduce BBC news to the point where the facts it reports are not in their mainstream coverage. All to avoid \"bias\".",

In addition to the situation you describe in which you agreed to work Christmas but are now quitting before Christmas, imagine you also took an old computer from work with your boss's permission, and agreed that you'd pay a cut price out of your January salary. (This is probably illegal tax dodging but let's pretend it isn't...) Now you're quitting before January but you already have the computer. You still have to pay for it.\n\nThe thing that makes it yet more complicated is that you're not quite quitting the company, because you want them to re-hire you as a part-time freelance guy. So while you could just fuck off and count on them not doing anything about the fee because it would be too much hassle, they're not going to give you a good freelance contract if you screw them over.\n\nFarage though actually doesn't want us to come back part-time so he thinks we should just cut and run with the computer and suck up whatever the company does since they're not going to ~~bomb South Thanet~~pursue it in court - they'll just write a bad reference or something.\n\nThe bill we receive is for stuff we're going to get - we're not paying for services that won't benefit us. Therefore it's not like we're just not coming in at Christmas because we quit - it's like we got something and agreed to pay later but now don't want to because we're quitting.\n\nBut even if you did this illegal, immoral thing and just sucked up whatever your former employer did, you'd still be entitled to a pension.

It's about the only unambigious clause in the entire damned treaty, because when it was written, it was designed to be a bulletproof, inescapable, no wiggle-room exit for anyone who triggered it, so that nobody would ever dare do it.
