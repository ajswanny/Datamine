Our Great British press in their role as the guardians of public opinion, have established The Bacon Sandwich Test to be a hard metric, by which we should assess any politician seeking the highest office. In looking slightly awkward at the moment of consumption, Ed betrayed a hesitancy which the public instinctively recognised and rejected. Had he taken the test in a more confident and decisive manner, there would have been no need for boring political policies or that sort of stuff as that's what the public want, someone who doesn't get bogged down thinking about things and just goes for it. \n\nBut their are certain bourgeois types out there who would conspire to minimise the importance of The Test. Those, who would somehow seek to reject the wisdom of the press and hence the very wisdom of our dear public, sitting in their ivory towers and pronouncing the Bacon Sandwich Test -  _The People's Test_ - as somehow unfair or meaningless. \n\nThere will be a reckoning.",

    "body": "Actually it's the other way round. The Tories tried to ensure a soft border between NI and RoI, but the DUP blocked them, as that would imply a hard sea border between the island of Ireland and the rest of Britain. What the DUP want is soft borders both on land AND at sea, which would require the UK to opt for soft Brexit. Ironically, the DUP whilst hated by all left wingers, are our best bet of persuading the government to step away from the hard Brexit ledge. The only way to solve the Irish border question without upsetting one of the sides in the Ireland dispute is to go for a soft Brexit where Britain retains the EU framework. \n\nSo the government has to balance whether it wants to opt for soft Brexit (supported by Ireland, the DUP, as well as the remain camps in Great Britain from the Tory backbenches to Labour to the SNP) or hard Brexit (now supported only by a slim majority of Tory MPs, and of course a majority of the British electorate). It's a tricky one, as Theresa May is only in office right now because of the support from the Hard Brexiteers, but she's only in power because of the support from the DUP, so basically she has to choose between cutting off either her left or her right leg. Either one is going to lead to her being in such a shaky position she'll be hard-pressed not to topple, unless someone steps in and supports her.",

    "body": "Right. Again, this is from an outsider's casual view. I could be woefully misinformed.  \n\nMy perception was that it meant fewer immigrants, meaning that the average working class person wasn't competing with someone from the EU for an entry level/working class job. As apparently, there are/were loads of people from the EU, who were vastly overqualified, taking jobs from less competitive UK workers.  All my UK friends, who were all remain, had convinced me this was an actual thing. \n\nIt meant that less money was going to the EU. And, that would mean more money for the NHS and to reform education.\n\n And, more sovereignty meant being more defensible and more able to make better trade agreements. I recall reading a \"group\" op/ed from a bunch of retired military that talked about Britain's inability to defend itself and its extensive military commitment to the EU's needs.\n\nBefore the vote, I saw all kinds of stuff on these issues. I have since seen nothing. Well, except the stories from last week saying that more money would 100% not be going to the NHS. I just don't understand what the push for this was, if those things aren't super important. ",

At the same time, the bankers have also made a huge amount of money, while trashing the economy for everyone else. \n\nYou're right that Ralph Miliband was well before the fees era, but having a father who's an academic is, I would suggest, likely to make you feel favourable towards academia. That's usually the way it works, and was more my argument re: Ed. \n\nPost-Brexit, I have no sympathy for the academics whatsoever. Their business model is now indistinguishable to that of Eton or Harrow, and their activities clearly haven't translated into prosperity for the UK as a whole. We're the [poorest] (http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/tgm/table.do?tab=table&language=en&pcode=tec00113) and most unequal country in north-western Europe. \n\nThe university industry is like a cancer. It's wasting the time and money of many young people who are not especially academic, and who ultimately end-up doing non-graduate jobs which they'd have been better off studying vocationally for. It lands people in massive debt, and it's been corrupted - many universities don't like to \"fail\" students who have coughed up fees. This makes it quite hard for employers to sort the wheat from the chaff afterwards. ",
