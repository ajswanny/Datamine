President Obama decided we wouldn't be at the 'back of the queue' after all and that our 'special relationship' was still strong. The French President confirmed the Le Touquet agreement would stay in place. The President of the European Commission stated Brexit negations would be 'orderly' and stressed the UK would continue to be a 'close partner' of the EU. A big bank denied reports it would shift 2,000 staff overseas. The CBI, vehemently anti-Brexit during the referendum campaign, stated British business was resilient and would adapt. Several countries outside the EU stated they wished to begin bi-lateral trade talks with the UK immediately. If this was the predicted apocalypse, well, it was a very British one.

    "body": "A question for the brits: However you feel about immigration it's obvious that the fear of too much of it was the largest driving force behind the leave campaign. But now that the vote has happened, does the voting populace actually have the stomach to push through the punitive measures to actually stop immigration?\n\nI ask because here in the US there has been opposition to Mexican immigration for decades ( and other immigration since the 1800s) , and occasionally measures are taken but they are never the ones that could actually be effective. Saying you want fewer immigrants, is a lot different than stopping them. Most people seem to be fine with tighter border control, but that does little at the borders, and nothing to all the people who just overstay their visa. But they won't support more immigration raids, kicking down doors to deport people, breaking up families, returning people to war zones or countries where they face death etc.\n\nIt's why I think anti immigration sentiment is so politically dangerous, many people want to stop/heavily regulate it, but don't support the draconian measures you'd need to actually do so. Britain can leave the EU but is that going to stop people from coming? Not very likely, it will make it harder but then you only get the more desperate. Just look at the migrant problem in southern Europe.",

Scotland might leave (even though they nearly voted to leave the EU themselves with their own referendum), they may not be able to join the EU. Who knows? Nobody.  \n\nAs for what I'll say in 20 years, don't put words in my mouth. The EU was close to the brink recently anyway with Greece looking at leaving and they're still struggling with that. There's a chance it would collapse with us as a member and take us with it (although, not having their single currency makes it less of an issue for us), and they will struggle without our funds.  \n\nMaybe we'll be worse off, maybe we'll be better off, only time will tell. It might not even happen.",
