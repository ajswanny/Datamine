    "body": ">The First Minister seems pretty hell bent on having another whack at independence. \n\nBecause she is a selfish glory hound that cant see that Scotland could simply not support itself as an independent nation and she cannot see that there is also the fact that Scotland does not meet the requirements to join the EU.\n\nThe EU accepting Scotland would be like the EU accepting another Greece that is in even worse condition than actual Greece is. Scotland has a deficit of 9.2%, 2% higher than the Greeks. The maximum allowed for a nation joining the EU is 3%.\n\nThere is also the fact that Germany would force extreme austerity onto Scotland. Austerity so strict that it would make what Westminster put in place look miniscule in comparison.\n\nAnd then there is the fact that there would be tens of billions of pounds needed to replace all the services currently supplied by the British government, and also to replace all the equipment used by the Scottish public sector (it all currently belongs to the UK government and would return to them). This includes military equipment. If you look at the SNP's military plans, that alone would cost tens of billions of pounds.\n\nThe absolutely enormous deficit the Scots would have after all this would require massively raising taxes, tariffs etc. This would be bad for business. Talking about being bad for business, the ocean borders between England and Scotland would be redrawn as a straight line extending out from where the border meets the sea, which would put about half of the oil in Scottish waters in English waters (which would mean England would be in control of ~98% of the gas and 45-50% of the oil). So no funding coming from that side either.\n\nAnd then there would be the fact that with Scotland in the EU (if by some miracle it got accepted) and the rest of the UK outside the EU, there would be border controls along the border and tariffs/trade barriers between the two countries. The border controls would lead to a lot of business moving the England from Scotland (a market of 55 million would be far superior to a market of 5 million) which would further decrease the size of Scotlands already very small secondary and tertiary sectors and the trade barriers would decimate the trade between Scotland and England and as 64% of Scotlands trade goes to England, what business that would be left in Scotland would be driven to closure.\n\nI'd give Scotland 6 months independent before it is either begging the EU for handouts or asking to rejoin the UK.",
