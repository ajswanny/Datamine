    "body": "/u/eairy is right. Hospitals often have specialist equipment that is/was built around a specific operating system. What happens is time moves on the OS becomes obsolete but the hardware solution it is running still works perfectly and is expensive to replace. \n\nFor example,a few weeks ago I saw a hospital running a Windows 95 machine in their intensive care unit, which appeared to be interfacing with their cardiac monitors (the ECG leads attached to the patients). It was pulling the data from the monitoring and displaying it on a central screen at the nurses station. \n\nYou'll probably find inside that Windows 95 machine is a specialist (and probably VERY expensive) piece of hardware that acts as a network interface card for the cardiac monitors. On the computer there is then a piece of software that communicates with that hardware and displays the data on a computer screen. If the hospital replaces the computer or updates the OS then they would probably need to purchase a completely new hardware solution (as it wouldn't be compatible) and probably new bedside cardiac monitors, new displays, new network infrastructure etc. That is likely to cost tens, if not hundreds, of thousands of pounds as these are bespoke products sold in very low volumes, so they don't have an economy of scale. Probably the most common solution to this particular situation is made by General Electric, called [Centricity](http://www3.gehealthcare.co.uk/en-gb/products/categories/healthcare_it/centricity-cardio-enterprise?program-id=PS-04-17-HCD-CARDIO&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_content=HCD-EU-UKI-CARD&gclid=CLePtJqx7dMCFUgW0wodJP8M-w).

    "body": "Thank you for being civil, I really appreciate it. I'm a med student and spend almost every day in various NHS hospitals. From what I can see the NHS is indeed very cash-strapped and the trusts are trying to make do with the budget cuts. Facilities are closing down and some health services had to be withdrawn, and patients now have to travel to the larger hospitals for some of the more sophisticated imaging/investigations. I.T. just isn't at the forefront of the mind when an increased funding could be allocated for the necessary day-to-day services. It would take a ridiculously implausible increase in funding for an I.T. upgrade to even be considered. An increase the magnitude of which (I imagine) no political party would dare suggest, as the public would go mental. Of course if this hack occurs more frequently on a regular basis then it's a different story. \n\n\nRight now I dont believe that upgrading each and every piece of tech in every hospital should be the utmost priority, not when they are perfectly functional in the general sense. On many occassions it just is not possible to do so, manufacturers would have to re-develop the software from the ground up. Just to give you an idea of the costs involved, one of the radiotherapy delivery machines at a hospital I went to cost 4mil pounds. That particular hospital had many more. Even attempting to re-write the software for the machines would be a nightmare. That is not to say that the hospitals aren't trying to keep up with advances in security though. The trusts are very uptight about pendrives/memory sticks, try sticking a pendrive into one of the trust computers and it wouldn't work; you'd have to apply for a trust-approved pendrive. Many regular email clients are blocked, at least for me. Yada yada yada...\n\n\nI'm not going to be political (I'm apolotical because I don't agree with any major party) - yes, Labour has pledged to increase funding for NHS, but they have always placed emphasis on the staffing issues, not upgrading the I.T. - I.T. just isn't as *sexy* and does not pique the interests of the public as much (perhaps things will change after today though).\n\n\nP.s. Although I disagree with Labour on many issues - I agree with the Labour to a certain extent on this (not just for my job security in the future). Increasing funding for NHS is the way to go - healthcare and education are two investments with the highest returns that a government can make. Thanks for having read my rambling incoherent wall of text!\n\nTL;DR - the trusts are indeed trying to beef up security. In many instances it just isn't possible, or at least not without an outrageous amount of funding. \n\nEdit: Avast has reported 75,000 computers infected (globally, not just the NHS). At a ransom of 230pounds per computer, that's 17.3m pounds, which is a drop in the bucket when it comes to daily operating costs of the NHS. NHS could just pay off the ransom for their infected computers. Of course, the attacks will continue and the ransom might increase. This is just my opinion but I think it would be more cost-effective to spend money prosecuting the criminals and set an example out of them to act as deterrents, rather than trying to upgrade each of the tech. I'm not in the I.T. business however, so take everything I have said with an obscene amount of salt!",

Nobody can do a thing about it.\n\nWe suddenly decide to start up again, under a different name. We push out a proper update to those drivers, and release a whole new product, with open source drivers compatible with Linux and pretty much every other OS out there. Suddenly people can upgrade their software... However the new kit isn't working on Windows 10. Someone cocked up the driver code, and it's all gone Pete Tong. Windows customers are going to have to wait until we iron out where the error is and release a patch. Linux customers won't have to wait so long, because some guy in his basement already pulled the source, found the problem, fixed it and released it upstream.

You can see [here](https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/vacancy/a04dbdd8be1accc38420430ff0951b4d/?vac_ref=914622038) that the NHS doesn't exactly pay competitive rates. Part of the issue is everyone (apart from doctors) in the NHS gets paid on the Agenda for Change payscale which was designed for normal hospital workers like porters/nurses/radiographers and not for very different professions like developers or IT managers. So they have been shoehorned into a pay system that wasn't really designed to match the wider IT industry.\n\nAnyway, when you pay peanuts, you get monkeys... or at the very least you get people who, talented though they may be, are the sort of people who will work for \u00a327K a year when they could be earning twice that in the corporate world... i.e. clock in at 9am, out the door at 5pm, 45 minute lunch break and a 15 minute coffee break, 'no sir thats beyond my job description', 'more than my jobs-worth' etc.\n\nI'll concede that there *are* some exemplary individuals in NHS IT (can you tell I'm being slightly generous because I'm pretty sure a few of them are frequent posters here haha) but on the whole NHS IT is lacking in ambition, talent and vision. When talent does accidentally end up in the NHS it is usually smothered to death by lack of resources or managerial support. A big part of that is because the health service as a whole has failed to attract the best and brightest when it comes to IT - in no small part because of the poor working conditions (as with all NHS jobs), lack of pay and challenging financial situation.

Now I'll fully admit I probably don't have all the necessary skills to implements all of this on my own, but here is how I think I could make the environment secure for those old legacy machines:\n\n-Step 1: ideally, have all XP machines virtualized and sitting on a virtualization server (HyperV or ideally ESXi VSphere). If not possible because no money to upgrade the legacy machines/terminals, not too much of an issue because of step 2.\n\n-Step 2: All legacy/insecure terminals or virtualized machines are all put on a VLAN with no internet access whatsoever. VLAN must be airtight, no exceptions.\n\n-Step 3: Have a fully up to date server (or virtual server if you have the budget, it can sit on the same Hyper-V or Vmware server as your XP machines if you go for that fully virtual option).\n\n-Step 4: Your fully up to date server will serve as your access point between your legacy machines and the potentially internet accessible rest of the network. This server must have 2 Network interfaces minimum\nShare #1 is a read/write (not sure if I'd give it execute, but that's to be further investigated in some scenarios) share linking to the VLAN to which all legacy machines are connected.\nShare #2 is a Read Only (to prevent an outside attacker from planting stuff that could harm the non-secure machines) that is connected to the rest of the potentially internet accessible rest of the network through a VLAN only accessible by authorized machines. All connections to Share #2 are only established using fully patched and secured machines using secure connections.\n\n-Step 5: Ensure that all non-legacy machines that need access to information from the legacy machines have access to the share. If the data needs to be added to a database on the potentially internet accessible part of the network, use a management software or script that automatically copies or pulls the share data to the database.\n\n-Step6:If non-virtual legacy machines, administratively or better yet physically disable all USB ports, cd/dvd players or other unused external ports or points of access. Ideally access anything those workstations might need (potential updates or new software) through the share server, or allow only the admins to temporarily enable a port or external device for the time needed to update the machine before disabling it again.\nSame for a virtual environment. Only admins are allowed to connect usb or CD/DVD devices or ISOs to the machines for maintenance purposes, though ideally all should be done through the share server. Regular users can interact with the machine through the virtual terminal, that's it.\n\n-Step 7: Profit... Well, at least you've done the very minimum possible in my eyes to make your network slightly more secure.\nI don't see any reason why the legacy machines should have internet access, but if they do, go the full virtual route, so the internet is accessed by the host machine and not the legacy virtual machine. I'm sure you could try to secure their internet access, but in my opinion, no matter how good you are, I'd still consider it almost criminal to do so.\n\nI'm no security professional, and I'm sure you could poke holes in my strategy, or significantly improve on it, but if I can think of something even half secure, I see no reason why someone with actual experience couldn't implement something like this.",

That was the point of the engineering analogy. If a computer system is known to be vulnerable and could fail, knocking out a vital public service then either don't use it that way or fix it. We do it (for the most part) with bridges, power stations, water mains but as you say, computers aren't sexy enough to bother with. Yes, the NHS needs more staff, yes, junior doctors shouldn't be fucked over but if you are using IT as a core part of the service, then paying for maintenance is like paying the electricity bill. You just do it. Because as when the power goes out, when the computers go down people die. \n\nThis is an example of austerity cuts costing more in the long run. If the staff were paid properly and in adequate numbers then it's a lot easier to justify an outlay to keep the infrastructure running well. But because everything is so tight on the front line it's inconceivable to suggest such a thing (this is where those so inclined start with tory NHS privatisation conspiracy theories). Also it's now world knowledge we have a shitbox NHS computer system that we refuse to fix, so either we have to rush job it (and pay more than the cost of maintaining would have been anyway) or we just get repeatedly struck by avoidable everyday attacks.\n\nAs to prosecuting the criminals, that will never work. Not just because it's difficult but for the same reason you lock your door when you leave the house. It's an inevitability that eventually, someone given the chance will try and break in. Taking steps to make that harder for them to do is just common sense. As much as  we prosecute burglaries, they're still going to happen.",

    "body": "> Why should the average lifespan of a desktop be 5 years? How much power do you need for a receptionist desk?\n\nDepends on the environment. Quite common for instance for your CAD jockeys/graphic designers/develoeprs to have overpowered systems for heavy graphics/design/compiling work which will cascade down to admin staff or receptionists in a few years (with a quick refurb), so yes, many systems may be more than 5 years old (with new SSD and RAM). But those systems will be reimaged.\n\nIf you've got 1,000 desktops deployed in a university, then you'll be upgrading through departments on a rolling basis, and communal IT labs tend to get abuse - people bring in food and drinks even when they're not supposed to, hammer keyboards - consider how many keystrokes your laptop takes each day and then consider how many a hot-desking terminal takes in a university - because when one person logs off, someone else logs in. They wear at an accelerated rate compared to an individually assigned machine.\n\nThe key thing is that it's pretty rare for a desktop to sit *untouched* for more than 5 years. Even if it cascaded to a new user, it will have been cleaned and reimaged for their purposes (obviously a receptionist needs productivity tools, not Blender, Solidworks or Visual Studio). You wouldn't just take a Windows 7 box and give it to your receptionist - you'd format, reimage to Win10, etc.\n\nLaptops are worse - they get abused, especially by people doing a lot of client visits. Expect 3 years max before keyboards get something spilt on them, the screen hinges get knackered or similar.\n\nI don't disagree that machines *can* last. I use a 2008 Macbook (with RAM and SSD updates) and my desktop was originally built in 2011 - just updated that with a bigger SSD, more RAM and a new GPU onto the existing mobo/CPU (though if you replace more than half the core components is it really the same computer?).",

If you're running a simple fileshare on Server 2003, then *everything* has to drop down to SMBv1 to connect. By contrast if you're running that on Server 2012, most of your clients (Vista/W7/8.1/10) will be connecting over SMB2/3/3.1 and only the XP clients will be using SMBv1, limiting the scope of your damage.\n\nMoreover, were you using a BSD/Linux server for your file shares, then their SMB implementation did not share the same bug as Window's SMBv1 implementation, so it would have killed it stone cold - WannaCry would be stuck on an infected machine unable to move. Diversity is good because implementation errors in communication protocols are unlikely to be mirrored, limiting the ability of worms to travel across networks.\n\nIf you're running a largely Windows based environment, then I'd contend all your \"generic services\" (file storage, shared drives, web hosting) should be on Linux/BSD - makes no odds to your clients because you're just using standard SMB/FTP/HTTP protocols anyway, but you've got diversity - different implementations on each end of the connection.\n\nLikewise if you have lots of Linux clients, then put your servers on OpenBSD or something with a different code base. Only use Windows Server where you *have* to (e.g. you've managed to get locked into Outlook Server or have some .NET applications).",

In any private system some people will opt to top-up their healthcare in ways you can't with the NHS. With the NHS if you want slightly better healthcare you have to pay once for the NHS through taxes and again for the entire private treatment. In the Netherlands you can just upgrade to a slightly better healthcare plan and pay the small amount of difference. In Australia if you don't use medicare you get a partial refund on your tax contributions. Either way upgrading to a slightly better level of care is much more affordable and so more people opt to do so. Thus total spending per capita is slightly higher. And outcomes are much higher as a result.\n\nIn both countries healthcare is universal; Australia has a small state-run system for the minority of people who can't afford private insurance. Poor Dutchpeople get health insurance benefits to pay most of their private premiums. Both countries' systems perform better than the NHS.\n\nThe difference isn't just funding. Private companies can get sued and have their reputations damaged by things like IT leaks and go out of business. They know how serious things like that are and apportion funds appropriately. Even with the same overall funding a private business will do whatever it can to eliminate inefficiencies and get rid of useless staff and send money where it's needed. As a last resort they can even eat into profits and bonuses for a while. And if they can't figure out a way to make it viable they go bust and a company with better ideas replaces them. \n\nState-run bureaucracies on the other hand know they will continue to exist even if their reputations are in tatters. Any attempt to reorganise is hampered by internal and governmental bureaucracy and they basically can't fire anyone. If these hospitals end up getting emergency funding to fix their hacked IT systems then that might even incentivise them to neglect their IT systems going forward to get money out of thin air.\n\nI'd be happy for the UK to adopt a Dutch style system. Heck I'd be happy if Britain could just have an honest discussion about the subject without all the histrionics about how we'll all end up with \u00a3100,000 bills when we stub our toes if we do away with the NHS.",

    "body": ">Which is precisely why the move to a new OS needed to be planned and started years ago.\n\nThere's alternatives, too. Backwards compatibility in modern OSes is amazing. I don't have enough OS X experience to say much there, but with Windows and (most?) Linux distros, you almost have to be incompetent to break backwards compatibility in a lot of cases. And arguably avoiding breaking compatibility should be a major goal of anyone programming something that should be expected to have a long lifetime (and thus also a priority of those buying said products).\n\nIn fact, the historical y2k bug is perhaps a classical example of people *not* doing that. It resulted from programmers thinking \"well, this software surely won't be used for that long, right?\". There'll be a similar bug in 2038 for anyone who stored Unix time stamps (seconds since 1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC) as a 32 bit integer. And lemme say that there's probably a ton of people doing that (especially since 32 bits is usually the \"default\" for storing integers and you'd only use a 64 bit integer -- capable of storing pretty much any humanly useful integer -- when you had a good reason to).\n\nAnd that's just one tiny example that's unrelated to OSes. You've probably seen Windows compatibility modes? One crucial thing that those do is that they make quirks of old versions of the Windows API (which programmers would use to access a variety of OS functionality) be \"unfixed\". The issue is simply that some older versions of the Windows API would do things weird or arguably buggy, but they can't fix those issues without breaking support. Hence, compatibility mode. That's one cool way that Windows, for example, manages to ensure backwards compatibility.\n\nFor another example that's actually showing how programmers can do it wrong, many low level languages (and not just low level languages, although they have the most) have something called \"undefined behavior\". That means the language or API spec has not defined what happens when you do something. A classical example is allocating an array of memory (basically a block of memory for your application to use) and then trying to access memory after the end of the array. This might work for some builds (possibly getting something meaningful or maybe garbage data). On others it'll crash (the OS provides security against accessing other program's memory). Theoretically, *anything* could happen. It's easy for a programmer to accidentally depend on undefined behavior that just happens to work on some platform and not on others. There's also implementation defined behavior, which is defined, but is not consistent across implementations.\n\nWhere possible, the usage of virtual machines might be able to help a lot in ensuring backwards compatibility. The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is a classical example of this. PS: not the Java you're probably used to seeing running in your browser. Those applets are a totally different thing. A massive amount of corporate server-side programs already use the JVM for reasons like this (not to mention the stability of Java as a language, itself).\n\nAll that said, though, nothing lasts forever and organizations like the NHS need to be prepared with an upgrade plan. This includes the possible replacement or sandboxing of outdated systems. Ideally they should also ensure that they have update programs with the manufacturers of whatever tools they use, so that they can be updated as needed. Such manufacturers going out of business is an area to tread with caution. I mean, even if we weren't talking about simply updating the OS, we don't want another [Therac-25](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therac-25). It's absolutely crucial that someone is able to fix issues that may emerge in a piece of equipment (and might not be caught for a while).\n\n**TL;DR: Programmers can do a lot more for ensuring that their programs will be backwards compatible and will have smooth upgrade paths. Buyers of these products can do more by demanding such expectations.**",

It's a brilliant technique because even though both of us want a strong, working NHS we're arguing over scraps. Take a look at brexit. We can't afford it, but it's a politically popular topic and look at how essential that's become all of a sudden.\n\nIt's a government (successive governments really, this isn't a new problem) with a toxic and dangerously ignorant attitude towards an important issue, exacerbated by deliberate and malicious political posturing who are endangering everyone's lives with their ineptitude. We as British people deserve better than being treated like this and then lapping up the inevitable spin that comes from central government somehow blaming encryption as being at fault for it all. When will enough be enough? \n\nYou watch. Next week it will all be about tackling cybercriminals who are evading the law using 'advanced encryption' to hide their activities and nobody will be talking about the rotting infrastructure already stretched NHS staff are forced to rely on by crippling cuts to public services. Unless Corbyn grows a spine and tears 7 shades of shit off the Tories for it. Doubtful.",

See if something goes wrong, including checking every piece of software.\n\nThe problem is with the errors that could occur with patch incompatibility sometimes the only answer is rolling back or even taking out a different patch. It means spending sodding hours sitting there on technet and etc looking for answers.\n\nI remember one time there was a patch that was put on the test environment that borked windows graphically (killed the aeroquartzwhatchamacallitthingy forgot the name) and a moderately important software package that we used a fair amount. After many many many hours of googling I discovered that rolling back a different patch and installing the newest patch fixed these issues. Why? I am still to this day genuinely buggered as to know why. I sent feedback to MS and they said \"Thanks for this\" and I never ever heard from them again. \n\nNow I can't say I've ever worked in an org as huge as the NHS with as many different bits of custom software that they would need to run. But to me that would mean needing to test the updates against ALL of the software library that your particular trust runs and sometimes a single IT department might support multiple trusts and maybe they're running different software packages for the computers in the X-ray department or the ultrasound or the dispensary.
