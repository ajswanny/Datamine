We will be inviting privy councillors from the opposition parties to the Home Office to have access to classified report on privy council terms.\"\n\n> The Home Office have instead published a brief summary of the contents of the report, which acknowledges that for some extremist groups \"overseas funding is a significant source of income.\"",

Reddit loves the idea of stopping the funding of mosques by KSA but US social media companies actually provide a far larger platform to Islamists (and other extremists). E.g. youtube is full of Islamist channels, twitter was one of the main recruitment tool of ISIS (and it wasn't even a secret). And it isn't just Islamist, reddit is one of the largest platform for the altright / far right propaganda. Extremists never had more of a platform. All thanks to those social media companies. But still reddit is defending them and obsessed with free speech. Honestly, Hitler would have loved social media. It puzzles me how everyone is surprised that we see organizations like ISIS or how the far right is becoming larger than ever since WW2 when you basically give them giant hate speech platforms.\n\nSo, yeah, KSA is shit but in the larger context they seem rather irrelevant. I mean having to watch your hate preacher on youtube instead of in a mosque doesn't seem like big difference. And Islamist terror organizations mainly recruit online anyway.",

This, coupled with public outrage, has kept the investigations going.\n\nThe situation here is quite similar - you have a massive, massive amount of income that's funding one of our biggest (and most powerful) industries, and they're not going down quietly. You can make another comparison to Net Neutrality, where a very small faction gains while the great majority lose, yet the minority is winning.

So ISIS changed tactics and motivated people to strike, incite terror, where they currently are, often with crude methods given the limited access to explosives etc.. The November 2015 Paris attacks were by far the most sophisticated and at least partly performed by returning fighters and even then ISIS was already on the backfoot, since then attacks have become more and more rudementory.\n\nSo what you are seeing is ISIS essentially becoming a more similiar to Al-Qaeda or other terror organisations like it, fighting in the middle-east in the form of an insurgency (attacks on patrols, suicide bombers, IEDs...) and abroad with more traditional terror attacks (bombs, suicide bombings, hijackings and now apparently trucks), they'll do whatever is in their means and - in the west at least - the most flashy from a news perspective.\n\nThere will be more attacks, most likely partly by lone wolfs recruited over the internet, more often than not with very limited resrouces...thats in europe, we have to see what happens in Iraq in Syria now that ISIS has lost essentially all its territory.",

Look, we know it's not the royalty in SA, its other factions - so it makes it even odder that we cater to them?\n\nGoing back to the Westminster bridge attacker and my suspicions. It's the only attack that's been pulled off that could be seen as an attempt on parliament, but they didn't get through the gates. There was also another lone wolf caught outside the gates in the time since then. These are the suspicious ones for me, and it all arises from us hiding this document. The other two I without doubt think were ISIS, they were more co-ordinated and disgustingly, even more brutal. ",

You can see the revisionism of history about how the far right and moderate right focus on 'Muslim slavery of Christian Europeans through piracy' which is basically 'won't somebody think of the white people'.  Forgetting that Christian Europeans were doing exactly the same thing in reverse whilst also depopulating parts of Africa through slavery.\n\nI'm certainly not saying that the response to these things of slamming planes into buildings is just.  A short memory of the many injustices committed by both sides in this is however very near sighted.  There is no way to balance these equations to reconcile them.",

I agree that it's often used as a tool to motivate people; but let's face it, no-one that is mentally stable, happy, wealthy and comfortable are blowing themselves up, regardless of religion are they?  You can can take the sting right out of religion by addressing the other causes.  \n\nIt's also perhaps worth remembering that in other parts of the world, Muslims are actually the ones being terrorised, there's nothing special about Islam that makes it the \"religion of terror.\"  The Bible and the Torah are every bit as looney as the Qur'an.  It just happens to be the religion of the people the West have been fucking over for the last few decades. ",

    "body": "> Saying it's \"Islam\" doesn't explain anything, it's just a way of saying it's the brown peoples' problem, it's up to them to sort it out. Which helpfully absolves our government from actually doing anything to fix it.\n\nRead this from ISIS magazine on page 32 http://clarionproject.org/factsheets-files/islamic-state-magazine-dabiq-fifteen-breaking-the-cross.pdf\n\n> We hate you, first and foremost, because you\nare disbelievers; you reject the oneness of Allah \u2013\nwhether you realize it or not \u2013 by making partners\nfor Him in worship, you blaspheme against Him,\nclaiming that He has a son, you fabricate lies against\nHis prophets and messengers, and you indulge in all\nmanner of devilish practices. It is for this reason that\nwe were commanded to openly declare our hatred for\nyou and our enmity towards you. \u201cThere has already\nbeen for you an excellent example in Abraham and\nthose with him, when they said to their people, \u2018Indeed,\nwe are disassociated from you and from whatever\nyou worship other than Allah. We have rejected\nyou, and there has arisen, between us and you, enmity\nand hatred forever until you believe in Allah alone\u2019\u201d\n(Al-Mumtahanah 4). Furthermore, just as your disbelief\nis the primary reason we hate you, your disbelief\nis the primary reason we fight you, as we have\nbeen commanded to fight the disbelievers until they\nsubmit to the authority of Islam, either by becoming\nMuslims, or by paying jizyah \u2013 for those afforded this\noption \u2013 and living in humiliation under the rule of\nthe Muslims. Thus, even if you were to stop fighting\nus, your best-case scenario in a state of war would be\nthat we would suspend our attacks against you \u2013 if we\ndeemed it necessary \u2013 in order to focus on the closer\nand more immediate threats, before eventually resuming\nour campaigns against you. Apart from the option\nof a temporary truce, this is the only likely scenario\nthat would bring you fleeting respite from our attacks.\nSo in the end, you cannot bring an indefinite halt to\nour war against you. At most, you could only delay it\ntemporarily. \u201cAnd fight them until there is no fitnah\n[paganism] and [until] the religion, all of it, is for Allah\u201d\n(Al-Baqarah 193).\n\nThey could not make it more clear. Islamic extremists hate us 'first and foremost, because you are disbelievers.' They will continue to fight until we convert. Which is why this whole notion of 'its the fault of Western foreign policy' is fatally flawed. The whole religion despises non believers. Even if we didnt do any foreign interventions, they would still be seeking to attack us, because we are non believers. \n\nIts ironic you say im pushing a narrative seeking to absolve 'our governemnt from actually doing anything to fix it.' You seem to desperately seeking to push a narrative that absolves Islam of any blame, totally ignoring the absolute contempt and hatred that religion has for non believers, which inspires Islamic extremism.
