For almost every night of my childhood I cried into my pillow, sobbing and wailing in despair, as I thought I would never be able to have one. When I got in from school every day I would sit down and stare for hours at my grandad's old passport, in its glorious, patriotic navy blue colour. Staring at it filled me with both gushing pride for the greatness this country once had, and melancholy for what it had become. We were once able to display our blue passports with a spring in our step, but the tyrannical, fascist European superstate robbed them from us. I can't imagine what it must have felt like on the day they announced that our blue passports would be replaced with hideous, grotesque, horrible burgundy ones - it must have felt like finding out that your only child had been abducted by pedophiles.\n\nAs I thought I would never have the honour of having a great British blue passport and would instead be relegated to using a burgundy one, as if I were some sort of lowly Polack or Frenchman, I decided that I would buy a rope and hang myself. But, in an act of what could only have been divine intervention, it was announced that there would be a referendum held on leaving the EU. I finally had a tiny sense of hope, but it was enough. I was nervous, giddy, restless. I spent countless months tossing and turning in bed, unable to sleep. How could I, if I knew there was a chance (however slight) of me one day owning a blue passport?\n\nWhen the day of the referendum finally came, I knew what I had to do. It was the pencil-pushing bureaucrat scum in Brussels who had tormented me for what seemed like my entire life. Those cruel bullies were keeping the British people down with Burgundy-coloured shackles. But June the 23rd was the day we fought back. And won.\n\nI couldn't believe it. When the results were announced, I wet myself out of euphoria. I was ecstatic. For the first time in my life, I was happy. My anguish and suffering was gone forever. We were finally going to get our blue passports back.\n\nYes, my fellow Britons, we're finally going to get it. And I don't care what it takes. These whinging remoaners have done nothing but rant and rave about the economic cost of Brexit, but I honestly couldn't care less. I'll do whatever I have to. I'll pay more for my groceries. I'll sew patches into my clothes instead of buying new ones. I'll eat grass. I don't care. As long as I get my blue passport.",

As in mocking caring about blue passports. It's an example of a binding, shared symbol that - for people who resonate with it and others like it - increases a sense of shared purpose (and even productivity!) That shared purpose is really the values of our culture, but the emblems remind people that those are things we're all proud of and strong in.\n\nThat's not just flagrant idiocy if you look at it more charitably. \n\nAlso: remainers, while less overtly patriotic, all have their own 'guilty pleasures' in terms of cultural nostalgia. We should embrace that and share it across the divide instead of trying to parse out who's more stupid for caring about their favoured intangible symbols.",

You can be very proud of being British. However, everyone I know of who voted leave (which is a large amount of people) that are 'proud of being british' also tend to blame all this on brown people taking over the country and \"PC culture\" as well as all sorts of other shit.\n\nI'm not saying \"stop being proud of being British\" but it would be nice if they stopped blaming it's decline simply on immigrants and foreigners.\n\nI do try, really hard, to 'look at it charitably' as you put it, but every experience I have with these people ends up the same and it's become very difficult to find people who don't just spout daily mail headlines and other stuff that was debunked ages ago.its hard to not see it as idiocy when people keep bringing up that bloody NHS bus thing.

One the one hand you've got 'hey you know we should be calm considerate and reasonable', and on the other you've got 'hey let's all have an eternity of free booze!'\n\nWhich do you vote for? Boring, mundane stuff that nobody really cares about, or a lifetime supply of all-night booze and debauchery?\n\nIf it ever happens, it'll be a LOT of fun. But realistically none of it will happen. You don't have to be stupid to vote for rainbows and unicorns. All it takes is a general feeling that the status quo is a whole load of meh.\n\nAnd that's where the Tories come in. They helpfully provided the 6 years of shittiness that had everyone so ready to vote for 'anything other than this bollocks' and spent the whole time saying 'we can't have it any better because EU'. So then people decided the EU was the problem. Then along came the endless string of promises of a baby-smooth transition to an eternally-great forever of free happiness Brextopia, and people were hooked in.\n\nIn that situation it doesn't have to be realistic, it just has to be said. No argument can ever be right against an unprovable prediction, because all arguments are themselves based on unprovable predictions. It becomes a case of what sounds nicer, instead of what can realistically happen.\n\nWell Brexit sounded nicer. It sounded nicer because there was no limit to exactly what could be promised. How many people exactly are there who both made the ~~promises~~ predictions and are in a position to deliver them? Boris led, yes, but he's nothing to do with Brexit. Farage isn't even anywhere near UK politics any more. Gove etc aren't anywhere near Brexit. All these people can say 'well if it was us doing it, it would work out better' when it goes wrong. That can't be proven nor disproven because it didn't happen and never has.\n\nEvery single point comes down to an educated (or indeed uneducated) guess. In 5 years time, I'll be on a yacht in the Caribbean. I can say that now, because regardless of how likely that is, it's still possible. Billion to one shot, but it's not like I'm legally bound to deliver it now that I've said it. Fuck it, I can also say without question that I will personally give every UK citizen \u00a31million at some point within the next 20 years. I'll do this from selling pieces of the moon to rich people, and I'll get those pieces by starting my own space agency, made possible by Brexit. Sounds absurd? Disprove it, then. Give me undeniable proof that I can't/won't do that.\n\ntl;dr: there's literally no campaign that could possibly have worked, because there's no watertight proven case to make. The remain campaign did a great job highlighting the absurdity of a smooth Brexit resulting in UKTopia. However, there was no way to prove that was absurd. There was never any proof to say it wasn't, either, so it came down to whatever sounded nicest.",

It sidesteps the fact that this island's wealth was derived from conquest and exploitation at home and abroad, and instead makes people think we were some sort of enlightened force of progress. \n\nThis thinking is the keystone of English cultural identity and is where our collective conflict stems from. Challenging our historical narrative is the only way to reverse a toxic discourse which is being manipulated to suit the goals of a specific sect of the ruling class. \n\nSo yes, don't pander to hateful thinking, but we can call an idea stupid, ignorant and xenophobic without having to insult the voter.

The leave campaign on the other hand had the luxury of creating a fantasy which could be anything to anyone, and being as they never thought about what would happen next it was impossible to criticise anything specific",
