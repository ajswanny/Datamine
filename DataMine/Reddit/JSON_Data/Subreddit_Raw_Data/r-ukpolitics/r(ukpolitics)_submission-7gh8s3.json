A US congressional district on average represents ~710 000 people, whereas a UK constituency on average represents ~56 000 - ~72 000 (wales having the smallest average pop. and England the largest). I'm not saying US Representatives shouldn't or don't do town hall meetings etc. but it is much harder to given they are representing 10x the amount of people.\n\nIt's even more of a poor comparison given states have state legislatures with their own members of congress. It's much more likely you'd contact your state congressperson about a local issue than expect to get some time from the national congressperson.\n\n>Congressmen and Senators in the US are practically demigods compared to our MPs.\n\nMy point above goes in some ways to explaining your point here; they are 'practically demigods' because they are way above local issues. Especially senators as there are only 2 senators per state, meaning senators in Wyoming (smallest state by population) are representing ~585 500 people between the two of them and senators in California are representing 39.25 million between the two of them.\n\nThe US system is set up so differently to the UK system that it doesn't make much sense to make direct comparisons about how representatives and senators can communicate locally compared to MPs.",

The Democrats are certainly now hugely behind those things.
