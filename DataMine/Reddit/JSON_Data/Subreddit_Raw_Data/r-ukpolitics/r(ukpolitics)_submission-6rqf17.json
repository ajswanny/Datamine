I honestly think the Queen has fulfilled this role very well. But in the future I hope it will be a temporary role given to an exceptional person from any rung of society.

Like u/engles_all_the_way [says](https://www.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/6rqf17/queen_elizabeth_ii_drinks_4_cocktails_a_day/dl73l6q/), there are a lot of other factors, such as the Queen's active lifestyle (her love of horseback riding) eating likely high quality food and access to great healthcare.\n\nIt's also a genetic thing iirc. Alcohol would be fine for some people and would be absolutely terrible for others (i.e. why some people become alcoholics and some don't). If the Queen's family history showed a regular consumption of alcohol without any complications, then it'd imply that their genes were compatible with alcohol consumption. It's also how someone can eat quite a few donuts without any problem at all, but one person could gain weight by only eating one. \n\n>Not sure anyone held that to be true anyway though.\n\nIt's commonly held that excessive consumption of alcohol not only could to weight gain in most circumstances but is also a [carcinogen](http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/causes-of-cancer/alcohol-and-cancer/how-alcohol-causes-cancer), which could be controlled if the person in question has lucky genes, a healthy lifestyle and good healthcare.

Here is the story about the Queen Mum and her staff:\n\nhttp://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4434378/The-Queen-Mother-thirstier-irrepressible.html\n\n>Following my appointment, I discovered the Queen Mother\u2019s pattern of drinking rarely varied. At noon, she had her first drink of the day \u2014 a potent mix of two parts of the fortified wine Dubonnet to one part of gin.\n\n>This was followed by red wine with lunch and, very occasionally, a glass of port to end it. Later came the ritual observed at 6pm, deemed the earliest acceptable time for an evening drink.\n\n>\u2018Colin, are we at the magic hour?\u2019 the Queen Mother would invariably ask, and I\u2019d mix her a Martini. After a couple of these, she would sit down to dinner and drink one or two glasses of pink champagne.\n\n>I was never much of a boozer, but I was expected to match the guests drink for drink, and the Queen Mother was deeply offended if ever I said no to more alcohol.\n\n>On the third glass of wine, I would tell her: \u2018I\u2019ve got to drive home this afternoon and I don\u2019t want to get breathalysed by the police.\u2019 But even that didn\u2019t stop her.\n\n>\u2018Oh, just tell them you work for me,\u2019 she said with a conspiratorial smile. I would later find myself slumped across my desk with my arms in the drawers either side of me to get my head in the right position for a nap.\n\nP.P.S. The Queen Mum was Scottish and the Queen is half Scottish, and that might account for the drinking tendencies. Scots behave the same even when they live in palaces.",
