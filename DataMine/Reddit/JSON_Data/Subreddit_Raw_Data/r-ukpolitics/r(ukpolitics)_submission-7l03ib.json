Its not too bad usually, and still a quality newspaper, but its truly appalling around election time - so much so that I can barely stand to read it.\n\nThe Independent used to be my neutral election time news fallback until it sadly went defunct :-( \n\nI honestly think the Telegraph (from when Ive seen it) has less biased news, because at least any Tory-ness is more obvious, while the Times has picked up the tactic from other Murdoch newspapers of claiming to be impartial while pushing an agenda.\n\n",

You can argue that the EU helped forge peace in Europe, but you can also argue it's divided Britain.\n\nThere's reason to believe that the explosive growth of Scottish nationalism, for instance, was a function of Britain's EU membership. It rendered Westminster a pointless middle-man between Holyrood and Brussels. This was predicted by Tony Benn as long ago as 1975:\n\n> The Common Market will break up the UK because there will be no valid argument against an independent Scotland, with its own Ministers and Commissioner, enjoying Common Market membership. We shall be choosing between the unity of the UK and the unity of the EEC.\n\nMy strongest and most controversial prediction for Brexit is that it will reverse the SNP's gains in Scotland. Looked at closely, their positions on Brexit and independence are completely incoherent. \n\nAnd for many of us, the unity of the UK is much more important than our membership of the European Union.\n\nEdit: Agreed on Russell Brand, who is not stupid but far too old to be the \"voice of youth\" he was touted as. At the same time, given the Guardianista bien pensant metropolitan elite is so anti-Brexit, their lack of recent celebrity endorsement is an interesting example of an un-barking dog. Michael Caine is pro-Brexit, whereas Mick Jagger is very anti. Gary Lineker and David Beckham were for Remain, Sol Campbell and David \"Dracula\" James for Leave. ",

Probably not enough to turn the tide around, but I reckon at least a decent chunk of aye voters are really foaming, and a fair few no voters have jumped over.

It would have slowly eroded the union. I came to the conclusion that Brexit carried short-term risks for the union, with the possibility that the SNP could take advantage of constitutional chaos to lever Scotland out of the UK. However, I also felt that if the UK could get through that period, the union would emerge stronger than it's ever been at any point in the past few decades.

The picturesque hill-town of Darjeeling spent much of this year in absolute chaos, because it wants to become a state independent of West Bengal...but *within* the Indian union. India has dozens of such movements. It's like watching cells divide in a petri-dish.  \n\nWhat should be clear from even a casual glance at the history books, but sadly isn't, is that continental Europe is the main beneficiary of a stable, independent Britain outside the EU.\n \nBritain has been a bulwark against, and antidote to, the many unpleasant political pathologies that have spawned on the continent. Had it not stood against fascism, communism, militarism, and Bonapartism, then the continent would be a very different place, most probably in a bad way.   \n\nGiven that trans-national blocs such as the EU have a habit of imploding, as did everything from the Holy Roman and Ottoman empires to the pan-Slavic Yugoslavia to the USSR, it's probably a good idea to have at least one major European country sitting-out the EU, just in case its members ever needed a rescue-platform. By way of an analogy, it's no great tragedy that Canada is not part of the USA.\n",

His salary when working peaked at \u00a335k. Soon he gets to claim his state pension of \u00a38k on top of that, and he could live for another 30-40 years.\n\nBecause of people like him (not that it's their fault, I'd take it if offered it!) companies like British Gas have to run higher prices. As it's across the entire economy, every large company has the same problem. Prices we pay on many things are impacted.\n\nMeanwhile, I probably won't get to retire until 75+ and will be penniless.\n\nI'm sorry but eventually someone has to say enough is enough. I guess the alternative is that our generation is \"lost\", having spent our working lives struggling through the 2008 crash, then the brexit slump, then the rest of our lives paying baby boomers to let houses and fund their pensions. The next generation will be fine, as we won't get much, or for very long.\n\nIn this particular example, the jobs of 3200 people are being put under threat to fund pensions for retirees.\n\nEventually it just makes you angry I guess.",

There's a lot of hate for anyone over 55 on Reddit these days, and most of it unfounded; yes, many of them voted for Brexit which is largely a selfish move, but it's not their fault that they paid proportionally less for their houses or that their pensions were well-funded. When they in their 20s and 30s they paid proportionally far more for other things - food, consumer goods, cars etc - than you are doing, and when you're old it'll be something different again - such is the way life moves on. I talk to my Mum about this a lot, and she says that yes - their first house cost \u00a32000 in the 1970s, but their low wages and high interest rates meant that they still had to go through a lot of hardships that would be considered living in poverty these days - not having a TV or a meal out for years, repairing clothes to get another year out of them, eating meat once a week, reading by candlelight when they ran out of coins for the electricity meter, and so on. This doesn't mean they're right to vote Tory or vote Leave, but you have to bear in mind that they have an entirely different perspective on life than you, and when they see young people buying their breakfast on the way to work, buying expensive phones or holidays etc they don't understand how those things are not considered luxuries these days like they used to be. \n\nSoon that generation will die off and the comparative wealth they are sitting on will get freed up for younger generations; they can't take their houses to the grave with them.
