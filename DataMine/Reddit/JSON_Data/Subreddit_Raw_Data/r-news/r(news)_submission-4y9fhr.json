She had stories of women claiming to be Pro-Life coming in and getting abortions, and one in particular stood out. It was like and 18 year old girl and her middle aged aunt. Sometime after the abortion, but while they were still there the girl mentioned she was very anti-abortion. obviously, the doctor wanted some more information because that's pretty fuckin odd. The exchange goes something like this:\n\nDoc: \"So why are you having an abortion?\"\n\nGirl: \"well I know abortions are wrong and God does't like them but for me I just couldn't have this baby. I already have another at home (She's like 18 too), I have no job, the father is gone, and my parents can't support three of us.\n\nDoctor: \"Do you think you're the only woman who has these problems..? tf..?\"\n\nThis long anecdote was my way of saying that everybody is a really special fuckin snowflake in their own brain, and people will do whatever they can to make the things that happen to them seem different than those that happen to everyone else.\n\n\nEdit: \"My abortion is the only moral abortion\" is a popular response. here's a link: http://www.prochoiceactionnetwork-canada.org/articles/anti-tales.shtml (thanks /u/deadline_zombie)",

Obviously that's wrong. Everything won't be alright - you'll suffer disease, you'll have unwanted pregnancies and your house will be flooded. So the mind goes to work again and creates the new narrative to resolve inconsistencies: in this particular case that seems to contradict your beliefs there are exceptional circumstances and it doesn't count. Move on.\n\nI'm afraid this sounds like I'm being superior but I'm really not.

And why would God take such joy in destruction? I guess my main qualms with organizated religious tenets is 'why'? Then again, I'm sure their typical answer is that no one can truly understand God's wisdom or why he does what he does. Also, I don't understand why an omnipotent being would strive for his creation to worship him and why certain people believe God would give them life and want them to spend the entirety of their lives worshipping him/her while also getting other people to worship him/her. Or why he would even make homosexuals exist if, according to people like the guy in the article, they're only there to be hated? I'm not even an atheist, I'm agnostic. I don't even know how atheists can prove there is no God, hence why I'm agnostic. Do atheists have *faith* that there is no creator? I'm rambling now and probably offended both atheists and religious people haha.",

    "body": "If you're interested in someone's personal take on those questions who's always loved science and also maintains faith in the Christian \"God\", I think it's to learn. If there is an afterlife, presumably we don't take our bodies or possessions, but we might take knowledge and memories. If there is a design involving that outcome to us being put here, as you point out amidst hardship and tragedy, I think those are the experiences that grow who we are on and beyond this plane of existence the most. \n\nI love getting blowjobs. I'd spend more time getting them if I could. I've also never learned anything meaningful while getting a blowjob. To live my entire life, constantly in that state, might start to get to be a pretty pitiful existence after a while. Comfort, satisfaction, complacency, are important, but I also tend to appreciate them a lot less while I experience them. Tragedy, on the other hand, is something that's dealt me a few blows over the years, and while I'd never call it a good thing, has had a much bigger impact on my growth as a person than complacency. Having lost friends and family, I've learned all the cliches such as how short/precious life can be, to express how I feel about people while they are in my life, etc. I also sometimes step back and thinking about how fucking lucky I am to have had someone in my life so significant that losing them hurts this much. This makes me want to embody and share their best qualities with the world. In general, it makes me want to be a better person. \n\nLess dire examples? Sure. I've dealt with pretty intense generalized and social anxiety most of my life. Even when nobody is saying any such thing, about 98% of my waking thoughts for years have involved what might be wrong with me and/or finding reasons to hate myself. Then I click on threads on Reddit involving religion so I can see what a cartoony, mentally unfit, hateful, deserving of misery person some people might think I am because I might kind of fit some societal label as a Christian. The only reason I'm comfortable talking about this is because of how much better I've been doing with it in recent years. \n\nWhat good came of that? Lots. Ironically, it's taught me to be more accepting and compassionate towards all people, even the ones I don't like that much from first impressions. I spent most of my years avoiding and generally not caring for the average person, and that sucked even worse. But all of that over analyzing while seeing a broad spectrum of who people are, I developed a better understanding and appreciation for the complexities that are found in just about anyone. I like my new perspective and it's made me a lot happier. \n\nWhere I am convinced that I'm taking some things with me when I go, I know the kind of person I want to be, I know what kind of memories I want to have, I know what kind of people I want to share experiences with before I do. I sure as shit have zero interest in being bigoted towards anyone- I'm lucky to have met enough people from just about any label or walk of life you can think of to know that if I let something that dumb color my perception, I'd miss out on getting to know a lot of incredibly cool people. \n\nI think the best tl;dr analogy is the river rock. A big jagged rock that exists free of disturbance stays jagged. Toss it in a river where it's subject to years of beatings, and it comes out smooth and subjectively beautiful. Sweet username BTW",

All of those stories about the life histories of mythical nation-founders are meant to explain something about those peoples or their political relationship with the authors.

The Hebrews hated Ammonites and Moabites and stories about fighting them and prophesying their doom are all throughout the bible, but they're pretty closely linked ethnically and linguistically. The incest rape is a plot device to show how people closely related to the Hebrews could end up, in their eyes, being so degenerate.",

But Sheila really doesn't want to stop, and besides, someone else will surely water it instead - it is a shared common space, after all. So Sheila goes on her way.\n\nThroughout the day, Harold, Ingrid, and Tom all notice the dying grass separately.

I, too, have lost a few people that were really close to me, especially my best friend, who killed himself two days after my 16th birthday. I just don't see God intervening or taking a personal stake in other people's grief. I can see how God would have developed the universe and everything in it, including how everything works and interacts with itself. But I don't see how God would create a natural disaster to slight homosexuals, just so a few zealots can feel better about themselves. And like I mentioned in a previous comment, I don't get why God would create homosexuals to be hated by other people. I guess from your point, it's so that homosexuals can grow their character through hardships, and maybe it's so the \"straight\" zealots can build their character by having to live through hardships of seeing gay people have rights and be treated normally? I would just think God created the universe and then everything plays out according to the laws of nature that God set in place. Obviously, everything I've said is just an opinion, just like technically every Christian/Jew/Muslim has their own opinion on the world and religion (hence the many different sects of Christianity haha.) But I digress. Appreciate you conversing with me in a civil manner, instead of berating me and calling me names or saying I'm wrong in my way of thinking.

It's hard for me to imagine an omnipotent being as old as time watching billions of lives like a TV show, but maybe that is omnipotence. I could never know. At the same time, it's hard not to imagine the details of our lives being seen as impossibly fine grains that make up something that looks more like a singularity. When I'm building something from wood (LOLJEZIS), I pay attention to the direction of the grain, I respect it, even try to shape it in a macro sense, but I sure don't know what each individual grain is up to. Not a perfect example given how many of them I have the intent of mutilating. I think we all had to be a little bit different, which amounts to such an awesome and beautiful thing about humanity, and some of those differences we appreciate more than others in no small part because we're generally imperfect. I'd firmly agree that if the God I'm thinking of exists, he has no interest in burning LGBT people under a magnifying glass. \n\nAnd thank you as well for treating me with respect as well. I appreciate having the conversation and I hope I've portrayed my opinions as just that, nothing more. Reading about your friend is heartbreaking and I hope absolutely none of this sounded like an arrogant 'you're simply better off'. I would never feel like I had any business asserting or even thinking something like that. I'm sorry that you and all of their loved ones had to go through that. \n\nIt probably goes without saying that most atheists are super cool. The militant ones are usually just kinda militant people.

It's not exactly 'the gay gene' that would be passed on, more like a probability to be gay. \nA really dumbed down explanation: if a community is successful because there are a lot of gay uncles, more nephews and nieces will grow to sexual maturity. Most of them will pass on their genes. However, since they share genes with their gay uncles, their offspring (and they themselves) will be more likely to be gay. A 100% hetero community with 100% hetero genes would have been less successful and have reproduced less, according to the theory. The sweet spot seems to sit at around 10% homosexual members, as that's what we see in most societies even if there's a stigma against them.\n\nWe haven't quite unraveled the mystery of what factors cause homosexuality yet but there are a lot of theories that suggest prenatal hormones might play a part. In that case, mothers could be unconsciously steering the developing fetus towards homosexuality. Lots of happy hormones and few stress hormones signal that he will be born in a thriving community.",
