Another 24 hours wasted but it would put it to rest.  \n\nBut, Trump could not help himself and tweets this morning saying I can tell anyone whatever I want so I did it for humanitarian reasons.  No you idiot - we just went through this with Comey's firing.  McMasters went out and said he was there and you did not say anything revealing.  Now you admit you did say stuff that was confidential but it is okay because you can do that as President.  So you made one of the very few people with any credibility left in your administration into a lier.  \n\nMcMasters frankly should resign today.  He would be an unfortunate loss, but a public resignation with the explanation that he cannot work in an administration where the President acts in that manner might be the shock needed to get Trump under control.  \n\nI do not know whether the man is just stupid, psychotic or just getting really really bad advice and counsel. We can hope and pray that it is the later.  But, things need to change drastically and right now. \n\n",

It's not as hard to stand up to random checks as it is to survive a concerted witchhunt, and even knowing that a picture exists is enough to destroy someone's career and even their life.\n\nWe spent weeks and weeks taking classes, doing CBTs, all to understand the meaning of the different classifications and how they were applied. We had to classify our notebooks according to the topic and everything was burned after use.\n\nTrump never did that. Sure, I believe he had *some* briefings, but I can totally see how someone who wasn't immersed in it and didn't really *get* the idea could let slip something that would seem to be well-known.\n\nAnd that, I think, is the crux of the matter. We all wanted someone to get rid of the crap and make things happen, whether you voted for Hillary, Bernie, or Trump.\n\nThe problem is that Bernie and Hillary have a lifetime of working in the world of politics and in gaining influence.\n\nThat experience shows itself in many ways, not the least of which is not blurting out things that shouldn't be said.\n\nIt's a double-edged sword. If you get someone who speaks his mind, you're gonna get someone who speaks his mind.\n\nAnyway, we don't know what the information is, whether the report is true, if it was even an accident or what, so I guess I'll just watch and wait.",

I would go as far as to say that it was not just stupid, but *monumentally* stupid, along the lines of punching the Queen's dogs to death in front of her because Kim Jong Un tweeted that he'd like to see it happen stupid.\n\nIt looks like Trump disclosed codeword information - this is the level above \"Top Secret\" and contains the most sensitive information we control - on a lark to make himself look good or endear himself to men strongly believed by all of our military and intelligence services to be connected to Russian intelligence.  No one else who had access to this information was allowed to disclose it to any other person, for any reason.  Not our allies, not anyone else in the government, not even military commanders who are operating in the AOR.  The only conditions under which this information is supposed to be revealed is on specific need-to-know basis to those with TS clearance + SCI clearance for *that specific codeword*.\n\nThis is exceptionally dangerous behavior.  It endangers our allies in the region, the intelligence stream itself, and our intelligence relationships with every other nation and entity on the planet now and for a long time in the future.  Current and future allies and informants will withhold information from us as a result of this failure of leadership because Trump has clearly communicated that no information we are trusted with, no matter how classified, will not simply be kept secret from countries we actually have a mostly adversarial relationship with.\n\nAs a result, this puts our troops and intelligence officers operating in dangerous conditions in much greater danger, because we are going to have less reliable intel to use in planning and executing operations.\n\nAmericans will needlessly die because of this.  Our partners and allies will suffer as well.  I can't think of a paradigm under which this was an even trade, although since I wasn't present and I don't know what was said it is conceivable that the Russians gave him some equally highly secret material in exchange, although I doubt it because they are not known to operate in such a brazen and irresponsible manner.\n\nIt's all the more disappointing when we stop to consider the things he and his supporters said about Clinton's emails, which under no circumstances could have ever presented such a threat or caused a similar amount of damage.  He did more harm in five minutes of boasting for no reason than she did in what were apparently years of operating an illegal system that was merely efficient for her.  At least her dumbass move broke the law for a good reason, while his *didn't* break the law but was utterly pointless.\n\nThe only rational explanation for this could be that this was the method his Russian controller decided would be best to allow him to disclose such classified material expediently and without major repercussions on their asset.  In other words he's either a pretty good Russian spy or a very, very dumb president.",

Sacrifice was not strictly a spiritual act, but overtime it was also both economic and political. In over-turning the money-changers' tables, telling us to give unto Caesar what is his, dying in place of our sacrifices of atonement, he was also over-turning spiritual dependence on these extraneous factors. \n\nTo be concise, voting on the basis of creed rather than evaluation of a candidate's virtues is un-Christian; the people who sought to merge politics and religion are the guys that murdered him.

I went to high school with people far wors than Nixon.\n\nThe real problem is when people try to pretend that any of these good deeds mean they're excused for any shitty ones.\n\nI work in hospice. I know that I personally have a record of making death an easier and more comfortable experience than most others do. My name is mentioned in a few federally mandated documents, and I've been doing this less than a year. But if I kill someone tomorrow--even if I'm just driving with a .085 BAC and the guy is literally jumping in front of cars--I expect the world to hold me accountable for not paying attention that day. No amount of easing pain of dying people makes it okay when I fuck up astronomically. It's basically the Michael Jackson effect--the dude may have dramatically touched my life, but he still probably fucked kids. Those are two independent things. Nixon may have been an otherwise fabulous human, but Watergate was proof enough what a power-hungry asshole he was. John Oliver ran a story on dialysis last night, citing Nixon's efforts to ensure that renal disease was universally treated in the US, and calling it the first step to universal healthcare. Surely, Nixon did some wonderful things which have impacted our lives in ways we can't really appreciate.\n\nThat doesn't make his actions excusable. It just means that we can't paint him as an evil villain who does everything wrong. We need to keep that in mind.\n\nFor example, Donald Trump DEFINITELY stimulates our economy with his millions of dollars in tax payments, paying his employees, and various investments. There's also plenty of evidence that he has been a shitty person in all of these regards in the name of profit. That doesn't mean we get to deny he did these things.

However, being able to apologize without losing face is a sign of strength exactly because it means that you're confident enough in your strength and image to show a bit of weakness now and then. Which is why you shouldn't apologize overly profusely or more often than necessary.\n\nOn the flip side of that, though, is that not apologizing at all is a sign of a weak leader, because it means that you're unsure of your position and can't afford to lose any more of your image by apologizing.\n\nSo, the fact that Obama could make these apologies and still end up a powerful and respected leader is a clear marker of just how strong and charismatic he was as President.

Wolfowitz et al subscribed to mind-boggling stupid ideological theories that middle easterners would welcome us to invade all of their countries and it would be a great idea, they would become American allies, recognize Israel, refund us for all of our expenses for invading them, free ponies for everyone, blah blah. They probably wrote this shit in crayon.\n\n> Failed to get Osama Bin Laden\n\nTrue. Rumsfeld believed in foolish ideological theories that invasions could actually be accomplished in just-in-time fashion with a cheap, light force and prioritized proving this theory over actually catching bin Laden. This also contributed to the year or two of chaos after the Iraq invasion.\n\n> Tanked the global economy and did nothing to stop it or slow it down.\n\nThey didn't do anything in particular to stop it but weren't completely responsible by any means.\n\n> Destroyed our education system with No Child Left Behind.\n\ndestroyed is a strong word. I don't think the education system was destroyed.\n\n> Gave out tax breaks for billionaires which were supposed to be temporary (but weren't).\n\nLots of tax breaks, not sure which one this is supposed to refer to.\n\n> Embrace Karl Rove politics (like accusing McCain's wife of having a half-black child, that he collaborated with the VC while imprisoned)\n\nCompletely true.

If true, must be one of the least worst things they ever did.\n\n> Did a heck of a job with Katrina\n\nCompletely true. Bush was such an insufferably bad leader that he punished aides for giving him any information he didn't like and refused to read the news himself at all. He relied entirely on aides to tell him the news, they literally hand-edited news clips into DVDs and played them for him, and they were extremely reluctant to tell him any bad news. As a result he had no fucking idea what was going on. His aides procrastinated for three whole fucking days to tell him that Katrina had even happened.\n\nAlso he appointed a bunch of incompetent cronies to lead agencies like FEMA out of ideological disdain.\n\nHe was a nightmare.
