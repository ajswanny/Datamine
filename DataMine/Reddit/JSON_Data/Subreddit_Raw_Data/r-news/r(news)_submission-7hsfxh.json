He also complained how Cher and Marc Ruffalo were rallying people against Pai's plans.\nThe Attorney General of NY State is investigating how robo comments effected The FFC's comment period. The FCC is stonewalling. When human votes were tallied, 98% were for keeping the current Net Neutrality rules.\nPai is saying, \"I dare you to stop me. I make the rules.\" If he carries that attitude into a suit against his repeal, some judges will tear him apart for that arrogance.\n\nPai's actions show that he doesn't have a case if he is pushed. It's all double talk. \n\nWhen the repeal goes through on a 3-2 party line vote, The FCC will be sued.\n\nUpdate-the 9th Federal Circuit Court ruled the other day that The FTC cannot regulate AT & T as an ISP. Pai had said The FTC should regulate ISPs, not The FCC.\n\nThat would mean in the absence of NN, ISPs would have total power and no oversight.",

Ppl would hate it, and telecom/ cable/ISP providers are known for one thing it's outstanding customer support.  \n\n/s\n\nThey will throttle your internet so fast (ie slow) and hard you'll think your OPs mom.  They will then say \"listen we didn't want to, but we have shareholders.  The shareholders forced our hand\"\n\nOn the bright side everyone... if they do this it's something that immediately, dramatically,  financially, and directly impacts ppls lives with clear cause/ effect. The rpresentatives have their names and party  (it's 100 percent a GOP effort) attached. Unlike taxes and healthcare; which are murkier (no less a republican effort to sell citizen's heath to push more of the nation's wealth uphill). The result will be bipartisan outrage and anger directed at the party that only reps corporations (GOP... i guess they also rep the 0.5-0.1%).\n\nAnd when republicans inevitably, and condescendingly say \"well if it's so bad just vote with your wallet,\" completely. ignorant of the lack of provider options/competition their constituents love with, the push to make ISPs utilities will gain mainstream recognition and support. The republicans will fight it, which will result in dems running on trust busting/ utility platfotms and winning bigly. Ultimately Comcast etc will be split up.  Rates will drop as ISP become a utilities, and finally net neutrality will be reinstated by law by the dem majority.\n\nEliminating net neutrality will absolutely result in the dissolution of Comcast, Verizon, etc. Into smaller companies and their ISP arms being made into utilities. It might take 3-8 years, but the pubic outrage won't be able to be contained. Take ppls healthcare, livable wages, etc.  Do not fuck with ppls internet!",

When regulatory capture occurs, the interests of firms or political groups are prioritized over the interests of the public, leading to a net loss to society as a whole. Government agencies suffering regulatory capture are called \"captured agencies\".\n\n*Edited for brevity",

Not because any of them are true or likely, but because it shows such a clear lack of understanding of how the law and regulatory agencies work. Now, people who aren't lawyers shouldn't have much reason to educate themselves on and understand that subject, but as a lawyer myself, allow me to help explain how this should work in theory. Note: this isn't legal advice, I'm not your lawyer, and if you need legal advice go consult with a lawyer offline.\n\n> So regulatory agencies exist in this weird quasi-legislative, quasi-judicial limbo of government. Congress delegates some of its power and authority to regulatory agencies because agencies can have far greater specialization and expertise on complex matters than Congress can, and this frees up Congress to do its job without getting mired in some of the complex technical, scientific, bureaucratic or logistical details of lawmaking. **This is emphatically a necessary aspect of running a government as large as the US.** I really can't overstate how important it is that Congress is able to delegate its authority to agencies. Our nation would grind to a halt if we couldn't (imagine Paul Ryan being in charge of what food quality standards Monsanto is beholden to...yeah, we don't want that). \n\n> So agencies get their legislative power from Congress. However, since they're an arm of the Executive Branch, they also have authority to enforce the law as well. This means that the laws (i.e. regulations) that the agency implements, it also gets to enforce. And the courts are happy to allow the agencies to enforce their own regulations because, like Congress, the courts recognize that these agencies have specialized expertise and are in a good position to interpret and enforce the rules they make. So the courts, which are jam packed all the time and are limited in their resources, allow agencies to fill the role of the courts...**but only to a certain extent**.\n\n> Obviously, the judiciary recognizes that these agencies could run amok if left totally independent from judicial review or Congressional oversight, so it's not like whatever the agency says and determines is the end all, be all of a regulatory decision. So what the courts have devised is something called the *Chevron* doctrine. It's called that because the case that gave rise to the doctrine involved Chevron. I'll spare all the details and permutations, but speaking in broad swaths, how this doctrine works is the default position of the court is to defer to the agency. This is in-line with the policy goals of why we have agencies, because if the default was \"guilty until proven innocent\", then the agency gets locked up in litigation and can't properly pass or enforce regulations. \n\n> But from that initial, deferential position, the court has some options that can lead to a repeal of a regulation (depending on what's pled by the plaintiffs). The court can look to see if the agency exceeded the scope of its delegated authority. Every regulatory agency gets its authority from a statute that Congress passes which describes the scope of the agency's authority. These are almost always worded *extremely* broadly - again, because a narrow scope would nullify the whole point of having agencies. That said, they're not unlimited. If the DEA tried to pass a regulation against, say, insider trading, that would exceed the scope of its delegated authority - that's a financial crime and the DEA has no special expertise on the financial sector, that's for the SEC to decide (don't ask why the DEA gets to classify narcotics when the FDA has all the drug experts though...). So exceeding the scope of the agency's authority is one way the courts drop the de facto deference to agencies.\n\n> Another way they'll drop their deference is if the agency engages in an improper notice and comment rulemaking procedure. Few people realize that there are actual laws passed by Congress requiring all federal agencies to engage in a certain pre-determined process before the agency can put a regulation into effect. The agency must first give the public **notice** of a proposed new rule (or change to a rule) and then they must receive **comments** from the public. If they don't follow the very detailed procedure for this notice and comment rulemaking procedure, the courts will not defer to their decision and will step in to render their own decision. The FCC is currently on the \"comment\" portion of the rulemaking process.\n\n> Now, there's tons of ways for an agency to violate the notice and comment rulemaking requirements. To cut to the chase, one of the ways is to ignore a material amount of the comments it received (\"material\" is a bit of a term of art in the legal profession - basically something is material when the outcome would be different if that thing were absent or different in and of itself; forking over money is a material aspect of a sale of goods contract, for example, because the seller wouldn't enter into the contract without the promise of getting paid). So, for simplicity, let's say 98% of ALL the comments Pai has received were in favor of Net Neutrality, but Pai strikes down NN regardless. What would happen is the courts would review, they would see that he ignored 98% of the comments, and they would refuse to defer to the decision made by Pai. This would be an **arbitrary and capricious** rulemaking process, which is against the Administrative Procedure Act. \n\n> That much, in and of itself, would be a huge win. What happens when the courts drop their deference varies in a multitude of ways, and I'm not going to get into all the permutations, but the pertinent possible outcomes are the court just outright overturns the FCC's decision and says \"there's no way you could ever repeal NN without violating the notice and comment rulemaking laws or exceeding the scope of your authority, it's up to Congress if they want to repeal NN\" or the court could say \"your repeal of NN, based on this rulemaking procedure, is null and void, but go start the notice and comment rulemaking procedure over again, and then come back to us after you do that\".\n\n> Regardless, the fact that Pai blatantly and obviously ignored a metric fuckton of legitimate comments from the public would be a material consideration of the courts when they decide whether to uphold or strike down the FCC's ultimate ruling on NN. Now, plenty of agencies have had their rulemaking process upheld even when they did ignore a lot of the comments they received - sometimes they have a legitimately justifiable reason to do so based on their expertise and the other comments that were received. There isn't any objective formula for deciding what's a \"material\" amount of comments to ignore (and there shouldn't be - the law needs to be flexible in ways that math and science cannot be). So I don't want to imply that \"Pai ignored comments, this is a slam dunk as a result\". Again, all that fact does is get the court to stop deferring to the agency's decision. At the same time, I don't want to understate how important it is for the court to drop its deference if a regulation ever has any chance to get overturned. If the court doesn't drop its deference, I think it's something like 99% of cases go in favor of the agency at that point (don't quote me on that though). \n\n> Based on all the news reports, and all the technology we have which could likely prove in a court of law that the comments were astroturfed, I personally believe it will be difficult for any court to justify NOT dropping their deference here. Cases like this are precisely what the *Chevron* doctrine was intended to handle. And it's why I was driven mad to see people saying that adding their own comments was worthless - BEING INVOLVED IN THE COMMENTING PROCESS IS THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT ASPECT OF PREVENTING PAI FROM GETTING AWAY WITH THIS. I really can't stress that enough. There *is* a check on the FCC's power here. But that check requires a huge number civilians to actually get involved in the notice and comment rulemaking process. The fact that we did that in this instance is a huge sign that this fight isn't over, even if Pai ignores our comments and repeals NN anyway. \n\n> This is just one humble lawyer's opinion, but there's no way a court upholds a repeal of NN after the effort we, as a collective group of individuals, put towards engaging in the rulemaking process. It's almost always industry players who get involved in the rulemaking process, and very rarely do proposed rules get this type of attention from the masses. Based on everything I know about this situation, I'd be willing to bet my license to practice law on the courts refusing to defer to the FCC when NN inevitably gets overturned and this goes to court. There's just no way this rulemaking process wasn't arbitrary and capricious, IMO. And that is enough to give me hope that the courts will overturn it once they drop their deference. \n\n>Tl;dr - The judicial system has the ability to oversee the rulemaking process regulatory agencies go through when they pass a new regulation, and the fact that so many legitimate comments are against NN is a huge advantage to getting the inevitable repeal of NN overturned by the courts. Keep paying attention to what happens though, as they may reopen the comment period after the courts make a decision. We'll need to show up again if that happens. **Trust in the judiciary. It's the only branch of government largely left uncorrupted by the influence of money, and it absolutely has the power to stop Pai - we just need to give the courts enough reason to do so.**",

THis has two main parts, difficulty in voting, and method of voting. Having only 10 hours on a single day, which most people are not given off is inexcusible on a national level. THen you have the \"ID\" laws which overwhelmingly effect minorities more, and \"prevents\" an issue which doesn't exist.\n\nThe other more important part is the first past the post style. WHoever hits 51% wins. FOr example ranked and double runoff provide a much better representation and forces moderation on the people.

It will have a clearly defined, directly-tangible, and negative effect on ppls' lives; specifically their Netflix video will keep being interrupted and buffering (this happened to me 2 weekends ago, and I would have been homicidal if I knew it was net neutrality related) or they will be paying significantly more money for the same quality service they used to have. \n\nMaybe I'm optimistic. I just think this has the potential to cut through all the noise. The lies and spin and partisanship.  If it plays out like number 3 above, no amount of propoganda from FOX will be able to obscure the truth.

Corporations usually donate to both parties simultaneously, though more to the party that is more in line with a particular issue.  e.g. a Democratic rep may get $1000 from big oil, but a Republican gets $15k when a fraking issue is at play.  \n\nAs a thought exercise, Corp X wants to sway at least half the members of Congress to at least be sympathetic to their wants.  535/2 = 268.  268 x $15000 = $4.02 million dollars.  You don't want to leave the other 267 in the cold, so they still get $1k each so your grand spend is at least $4.3 million dollars.  \n\n$4.3M in multi-billion dollar industries?  It's pocket change.  Less than a percent of the sales & marketing budget.  For one company with one law they want changed/created.\n\nHow is the public supposed to combat that?  Each time any company on the Fortune 1000 wants something that is against the public good we have to Go Fund Me a cool $5,000,000 dollars?  We can't keep up with that.\n\nEach of the Fortune 1000 companies can spend $5M or $10M or $20M to generously buy each member of Congress and it still wouldn't even come close to hitting a single percent of their entire marketing department's annual budget.  And with *far* better return on dollars spent when it works.  \n\nOr force multipliers when multiple Fortune 1000 companies want the same thing?  You have 5 companies giving $30k to half of Congress.

The masks might change but there are certain constants that have persisted through the decades.\n\nI think one way or another things will continue on this current trend (though it does seem to have sped up recently) until we reach some sort of breaking point.

Persons are divided into \"natural persons\" and \"juridical persons.\" The former are humans, the latter are entities/governments. \n\nWhen I contract with a business (example, buying a phone from an apple store), I am not making a contract with the teller or with the CEO or with the shareholders; I make it with Apple. Apple owes me a phone, and I owe Apple cash. I can sue Apple if my phone is broken on delivery but not repaired; Apple sues me if I never pay them the price. In this scenario, Apple and I are \"persons,\" the \"objects\" are phone and price, and the obligations/rights are \"to give\" and \"to demand.\" \n\nApple's status as a \"person\" just means that I can deal with it or engage in litigation with it. Apple is not afforded every right afforded to natural persons; for examples, it lacks the rights to vote or to marry or to be a parent or to have a parent or to make a will.\n\nAlso worth noting because of how many people make the error: Citizens United neither decided that corporations were persons nor decided that they had a right to free speech. The prior designation was already firmly established in every single country by virtue of ancient contract and tort law. The latter designation was settled by virtue of the first amendment's language prohibiting restrictions on \"speech\" rather than on \"speech of natural persons;\" keep in mind that juridical persons existed at the time the Bill of Rights was written, the founders could have decided that only human speech was worth protecting. Of course, every speech attributed to juridical persons will still involve a human speaker as well.",

Replace that with \"government\" or \"university\" and a more obscure person, and no one will care.\n\n---\n\nIn my opinion, there is a supply of people who are workaholics and want to be married to their work and give a 100%, and there's nothing wrong with having a demand for them.\n\nAnybody applying for a job at companies like Amazon or SpaceX who doesn't already know this is an idiot. Most of this noise is made by people who were magically expecting better for themselves despite what they knew to be the work environment.",

    "body": "We used to have a guy that would bring in a rose. And he would tell the girls in the class the every time she had sex, she would lose a petal. So he would chop of petal after petal until it was just a stem with an ugly bunch of rose petal fragments and tell the girls that that was her fate having sex before marriage. That every petal lost tarnished her and made her less desirable and more unappealing. The mere concept of teaching that to teenagers when sexual mistakes do sometimes just happen in the spur of the moment...you should never teach a teenager or child that giving in to a desire makes the dirty or less as a person. You should teach them to appreciate the gift it is the first time, and cherish it for being a big moment, but not that is lessens who that are as a human being. It was one of the few times my health teacher (he wasn't the one teaching it was a guest teacher every year for sex ed) would let any student walk out and not count against them. I could tell he found it disgusting.",
