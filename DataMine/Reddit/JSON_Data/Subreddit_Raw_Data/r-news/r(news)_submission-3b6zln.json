    "body": "I've seen a lot of people ask how the Supreme Court has the authority to decide this issue for states. For those interested, I am an American lawyer and I can answer that question with some insight.\n\nYes, the Supreme Court does have the authority to make sweeping decisions that invalidate any and all state laws which conflict with its ruling. The Supreme Court finds this authority in the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution and from the very significant court case of *Marybury vs. Madison* which more or less established the Supreme Court's absolute authority to literally \"say what the law is.\"\n\nStates do have autonomy to decide certain issues for themselves. These are judicial notions of 'comity' and 'parity,' the idea that state governments are better equipped to deal with local and regional issues rather than a distant Congress in Washington. In fact, the laws of contracts traditionally belong to states, which is why every state in the U.S. has slight legal differences in how contracts are formed, enforced, written, etc. Marriage, in its most basic legal form, is a contract entered into by two consenting adults, which is why marriage laws have been decided by state legislatures and state courts.\n\nBut there's an important amendment to the U.S. Constitution that (as of today) strips away the right of a state to define marriage in their laws as a union between one man and one woman: the Fourteenth Amendment (and more specifically the Equal Protection Clause) which states:\n\n> No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\n \nWithout getting too much into the nuances of the Supreme Court's varying standards of review (although I certainly can if you're interested), the Supreme Court traditionally reviews Equal Protection issues under what's called a 'rational basis review.' It is the most permissive standard the Court can adopt--that is, it is the least difficult standard to meet in order to successfully defend a law from being struck down. The review asks whether a law is rationally related to a legitimate government interest. With respect to the issue of marriage equality, the question is: Are state laws banning same-sex marriage rationally related to the legitimate government interest of protecting the institution of marriage?\n\nTo that question the Supreme Court has apparently said 'no.' The fact that the Supreme Court today could not find any rational basis for these state bans related to the stated goal of protecting the institution of marriage says *a lot*. The Court is literally saying there is no rational relationship between banning same-sex marriage and protecting marriage. Thus, same-sex marriage bans are unconstitutional under the Fourteenth Amendment, and every such law in the United States is immediately invalidated.\n\nThe Supreme Court has made sweeping judgments like this before, although decisions of this magnitude are quite rare. For examples, see *Brown vs. Board of Education* (which held that state laws enacting racial segregation were unconstitutional) and *Loving vs. Virginia* (which held that state laws banning interracial marriage were unconstitutional).\n\nTL;DR: Yes, the Supreme Court has the authority to say what the law is for the entire nation. Yes, marriage is traditionally an area kept to state law, but only up to a limit until a law runs headlong into the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause.\n\n**Important Edit:** It appears I've disseminated some amount of disinformation for which I apologize (I did not get around to actually reading the full opinion until now). As pointed out to me by /u/Armonster20, the Supreme Court **DID NOT** review this case under rational basis. Rather, it was decided under a strict scrutiny review. The majority opinion does not even make much mention at all of the words \"sexual orientation,\" instead focusing on the fundamental right of marriage. A lot of you have asked about the varying standards of review, but I must confess that constitutional law is outside my usual day-to-day practice and I'm doing the best I can to remember the basics I learned in law school. I could try to explain the standards of review in detail but I'm afraid of saying something inaccurate. The least I can do is direct you **[here](http://blogs.findlaw.com/law_and_life/2014/01/challenging-laws-3-levels-of-scrutiny-explained.html)**.\n\nBut to go into just a little more detail, the strict scrutiny test is the most demanding standard of review to which the Supreme Court can subject a law. The reason the Supreme Court chose to review this case under this very exacting test is quite logical actually: the Supreme Court has previously said that any law that abridges a \"fundamental right\" must meet the most demanding scrutiny, and the Supreme Court has previously deemed the right to marry as a fundamental right. Thus, because any state law that excludes an entire class of people from participating in marriage obviously implicates the fundamental right to marry, we get strict scrutiny. (FYI - Another fundamental right under the Constitution is the right to have an abortion.)\n\nWhat this means is that the majority made it damn-near impossible for the respondents (i.e., the states defending their same-sex marriage bans) to win in this case. What this does NOT mean is that any future LGBT issues will be given the same standard review, unless they of course deal with marriage. Most likely, any future litigation on LGBT issues will be subject to rational basis review or something that's informally been called \"rational basis review with a bite\"--a standard somewhere between normal rational basis and intermediate scrutiny.",

    "body": "Full opinion:\n\nhttp://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/14-556_3204.pdf\n\n**Highlights from the Majority**\n\n> * The nature of injustice is that we may not always see it in our own times.  The generations that wrote and ratified the Bill of Rights and the Fourteenth Amendment did not presume to know the extent of freedom in all of its dimensions, and so they entrusted to future generations a charter protecting the right of all persons to enjoy liberty as we learn its meaning.  When new insight reveals discord between the Constitution\u2019s central protections and a received legal stricture, a claim to liberty must be addressed\n\n> * Many who deem same-sex marriage to be wrong reach that conclusion based on decent and honorable religious or philosophical premises, and neither they nor their beliefs are disparaged here. But when that sincere, personal opposition becomes enacted law and public policy, the necessary consequence is to put the imprimatur of the State itself on an exclusion that soon demeans or stigmatizes those whose own liberty is then denied. \n\n> * No union is more profound than marriage, for it embodies the highest ideals of love, fidelity, devotion, sacrifice, and family. In forming a marital union, two people become something greater than once they were. As some of the petitioners in these cases demonstrate, marriage embodies a love that may endure even past death. It would misunderstand these men and women to say they disrespect the idea of marriage. Their plea is that they do respect it, respect it so deeply that they seek to find its fulfillment for themselves. Their hope is not to be condemned to live in loneliness, excluded from one of civilization\u2019s oldest institutions. They ask for equal dignity in the eyes of the law. The Constitution grants them that right.\n\n**Highlights from the Roberts Dissent**\n\n> * When decisions are reached through democratic means, some people will inevitably be disappointed with the results. But those whose views do not prevail at least know that they have had their say, and accordingly are\u2014in the tradition of our political culture\u2014reconciled to the result of a fair and honest debate. ... But today the Court puts a stop to all that. By deciding this question under the Constitution, the Court removes it from the realm of democratic decision. There will be consequences to shutting down the political process on an issue of such profound public significance. Closing debate tends to close minds. People denied a voice are less likely to accept the ruling of a court on an issue that does not seem to be the sort of thing courts usually decide.\n\n> * If you are among the many Americans\u2014of whatever sexual orientation\u2014who favor expanding same-sex marriage, by all means celebrate today\u2019s decision. Celebrate the achievement of a desired goal. Celebrate the opportunity for a new expression of commitment to a partner. Celebrate the availability of new benefits. But do not celebrate the Constitution. It had nothing to do with it.\n\n**Highlights from the Scalia Dissent**\n\n> * This is a naked judicial claim to legislative\u2014indeed, super-legislative\u2014power; a claim fundamentally at odds with our system of government.\n\n> * But what really astounds is the hubris reflected in today\u2019s judicial Putsch.\n\n> * If, even as the price to be paid for a fifth vote, I ever joined an opinion for the Court that began: \"The Constitution promises liberty to all within its reach, a liberty that includes certain specific rights that allow persons, within a lawful realm, to define and express their identity,\" I would hide my head in a bag. The Supreme Court of the United States has descended from the disciplined legal reasoning of John Marshall and Joseph Story to the mystical aphorisms of the fortune cookie.\n\n**Highlights from the Alito Dissent**\n\n> * By imposing its own views on the entire country, the majority facilitates the marginalization of the many Americans who have traditional ideas. Recalling the harsh treatment of gays and lesbians in the past, some may think that turn-about is fair play. But if that sentiment prevails, the Nation will experience bitter and lasting wounds.\n\n**Highlights from the Thomas Dissent**\n\n> * (LOL, not worth including)",

The fundamental\nright to marry does not include a right to make\na State change its definition of marriage. And a State\u2019s\ndecision to maintain the meaning of marriage that has\npersisted in every culture throughout human history can\nhardly be called irrational. In short, our Constitution does\nnot enact any one theory of marriage. The people of a\nState are free to expand marriage to include same-sex\ncouples, or to retain the historic definition.\n\n> Today, however, the Court takes the extraordinary step\nof ordering every State to license and recognize same-sex\nmarriage. Many people will rejoice at this decision, and I\nbegrudge none their celebration. But for those who believe\nin a government of laws, not of men, the majority\u2019s approach\nis deeply disheartening. Supporters of same-sex\nmarriage have achieved considerable success persuading\ntheir fellow citizens\u2014through the democratic process\u2014to\nadopt their view. That ends today. Five lawyers have\nclosed the debate and enacted their own vision of marriage\nas a matter of constitutional law. Stealing this issue from\nthe people will for many cast a cloud over same-sex marriage,\nmaking a dramatic social change that much more\ndifficult to accept. \n\nPrediction: Downvoted into oblivion, by a 5-4 margin. \n\nEDIT: Added clarifying information to first line.

If only.*\n\nI wish you were right, as a gay rights activist, but as a lawyer, I can't let this horrible misunderstanding stand. The holding of this case does not identify sexual orientation as a suspect class. Hell, the *dicta* doesn't even identify sexual orientation as a suspect class. \n\nThe fact that he said the words \"Equal Protection Clause\" do not magically have the effect that you're suggesting. Not even remotely. The Equal Protection clause analysis departs from \"rational basis\" scrutiny in *two* situations. First, as you are apparently aware, they will apply more exacting scrutiny to a law that burdens a group based upon a suspect classification (strict scrutiny for race; a more intermediate level for gender) . Second, as I suspect you may *not* be aware based upon your conclusion here, it also applies more exacting scrutiny **when the classification burdens a fundamental right.** That's clearly what Kennedy is talking about here. \n\n>And the Equal Protection Clause... prohibits this unjustified infringement of the **fundamental right** to marry.\n\nThis doesn't touch on sexual orientation as a suspect class *at all*. It's not even something that you could fairly infer. A first year law student who has completed their Constitutional law course could tell you as much. \n\nSo please, don't get people's hopes up by spreading this misinformation.",
