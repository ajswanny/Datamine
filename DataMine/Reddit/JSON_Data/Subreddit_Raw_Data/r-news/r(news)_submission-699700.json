When driving at 70mph, your attention span for a billboard is very low (between 3-5 seconds). \n\nAnyone who saw this and didn't care to find out more by going on a website is probably the same type of person who wouldn't care to read this billboard anyways.

I agree people should be skeptical in general and do some research for themselves, but the reality is there are thousands of headlines like this, and some people are out there working 3 jobs; between work, school, family, and whatever else, most people don't have the time to go sleuthing for a couple hours over every piece of news they read. In this case, I'd cut them some slack, as ultimately it's probably a good thing that a lot of people are getting upset and resisting these changes regarding privacy, even if they don't all understand what's going on completely",

I absolutely will not, under any circumstances, vote for a major party candidate that doesn't endorse such reforms. I will contact each candidate on the ballot to ask for their stance on the issue and let them know that my vote is conditional on that. \n\nI intend to utilize this strategy until it is no longer necessary even if no one else joins me.

Without it, we're either going to end up stripped of our individual rights, brainwashed into believing we're free when we're not, or they'll run \"black bag\" missions in the dead of night on \"dissenters\", televise it, and have us so afraid of them that we'll all be living a life remarkably similar to the society in \"V for Vendetta\".
