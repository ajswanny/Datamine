    "body": "Learning about this really hit me in the gut. \n\nI'm 30 years old now and I got into Linkin Park when I was just a freshman back in highschool in 2000. I had a very rough childhood because I have a scar that disfigures part of my face, I was teased for much of my life and I was always the 'odd' kid. Highschool made it all worse and I didn't have anyone to really...fall back on. I came from a poor family, my mom was a drug addict, my dad fell back into alcoholism when my nanny (his mother) died. I didn't have very many friends. All I had were my books. I was really struggling and I had a few acquiescence I had made with some goth and punk kids. \n\n\nWell, one day, one of them I'd say I was friends with came to me and gave me this beat up discman. It was blue and silver and covered in stickers. They also gave me a burned copy of Hybrid Theory and told me \"you should really listen to this\". I did and like...I just remember having this intense, tingling feeling rush through me. For as much as people make fun of linkin park's lyrics these days, to someone in that mind state it really...speaks to them. \n\n\nAs I listened to the songs I realized everything they sung about was what I was going through and that meant there were people out there who did understand. They understood, they made it through and now here they are, singing about it. That revelation stopped me from ending my life.\n\n\nOne of their songs asks \"What am I leaving when i'm done here?\". I wish more than anything I would have been able to tell Chester and the rest of the band that atleast ONE thing, of many, they left was a young girl who found a way to fight through their depression and keep going forward.\n\nEdit: Oh wow, I didn't expect this comment to get the attention it did. What a surprising thing to come home to. Thank you so very much to everyone who has liked this, commented on this, and to the wonderful user who gave me my first ever reddit gold. The messages I've received for having shared this bit of my past have truly been uplifting and I am so glad there are so many great people supporting each other here. \n\nEdit2: I'm truly beyond words. Thank you so much for the great things you've said. I'm trying to respond to everyone who has commented or messaged me but that's a bit of a larger task than I can manage at the moment. You are all so very wonderful for showing how much you care and supporting your fellow fans. ",

Hybrid Theory and Meteora carried me through some dark times in my youth. \n\nThe one lasting memory is putting Meteora in my mini hifi and writing a suicide note to my parents, telling them to play Breaking the Habit and Numb to understand why I killed myself. \n\nI put Breaking the Habit on and lay in the bath with a big, sharp knife in my hand. I started singing the lyrics to myself and decided to wait until the song was done to cut myself. \n\nAt that moment, halfway through the song my dad knocked on the door. He never came to my cottage (in my parents' backyard). He came in and asked me if something was bothering me and that I should talk to them. He didn't know what I was about to do. So we sat and listened to the album as I talked to him.\n\nRIP Chester, and thanks for everything you meant to me.  ",

I couldn't understand half of what they were saying, I couldn't understand any of the feelings they were trying to express. \"In the end\" was catchy as hell and so I persisted with the album. I would try to sing along and sing aloud, I would try to scream like Chester, I would try to rap like Mike. I'm now a 30 year old who lives in Atlanta, GA. I'm fluent in English only because I tried to impersonate Chester. His music is what I used as a springboard into American culture. This one hurts. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nEDIT: Whoa. I don't Reddit frequently so coming back to gold and all this love was unexpected. Thank you all for sharing your stories, this just goes to show that the human experience is so similar throughout. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nEven though it's coming very late, I'd like take this edit as an opportunity to showcase the struggles of keeping up with Linkin Park as a fan from the third world. My 56k dial-up internet was so bad that I had to download 96 kbps versions of MP3s because any larger file just wouldn't finish downloading. When I first found Kazaa, I would see all these \"New Linkin Park\" songs and after hours of downloading, it'd turn out to be Adema or Taproot or something. I fell for it over and over again. Back then you had to pay for internet by the hour, so imagine how thrilled my older sisters were when they found out that I used all of our internet hours trying to download the music video for 'In The End.' Thankfully it was the real deal and not one of those DBZ fan clips.",

Around the same time, Linkin Park's 'A Thousand Suns' came out, featuring songs like 'Waiting For The End' and 'The Catalyst' that really spoke to me.  The inner booklet [described how the album was a study of human emotion, and how 'change is born in our most harrowing moments'](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_YJM766qf5ps/TN68YEQwZ7I/AAAAAAAAMRM/8mE_31RQNI0/s1600/Booklet-2.jpg), and for the first time in a long time my perspective on my situation began to change.

The rock station in town was **not** liked at all, in fact shut down in 2002 for being \"too vulgar\" playing heavy metal music, and not many people listened to it at all. \n\nAnyway, all of 10 people showed up to the meet-&-greet at the record store. I remember seeing a young guy with green hair come out of an SUV and we didn't even know what Linkin Park looked like really. No one clapped, no one really noticed until they went in and sat down. They had their CD, Hybrid Theory up for sale for $4.99 and they would sign it for free. Didn't want to buy it, but the radio station gave me a license plate for them to sign.\n\nI got to talk to Chester at the event a little bit, and he seemed like a really nice guy and was SUPER excited to have even 10 people show up for him. He shook all of our hands and him and Mike Shinoda were really gracious guys - the whole band was really. They were still SUPER new and being on a nationwide tour with P.O.D. was just a lot for them to process. I'll never forget meeting them, I still remember it fondly 16 years later. I've always been a fan, I even bought their songs for Rock Band 3 and bought the keyboard that goes with so I could play the Pro Keys for it, which was somewhat like actually playing the song. \n\nTo my wife, she was going through stage 4 breast cancer in 2001 (we didn't know each other at the time) and she was given 3 months to live. She struggled though, but she thought it was the end for her. The music of Linkin Park's first album, especially \"In The End\" was what got her through her Chemo and radiation therapy and she's now 16 years cancer-free. She is beyond words right now, I wish I wasn't stuck at work right now.\n\nRIP Chester.",

    "body": "I'm Asian, so I never talk about my feelings because it's a bad holdover from how I was raised.\n\nWhen I was younger, I was walled in by strict christian Asian parents who dictated my life. I was only to have christian friends. I was to win at everything. A loss, to them, was only possible if I did not have faith in god and was therefore a wicked child who didn't try hard enough. If god could part the red sea, surely I could become the national champion in six different things at once. I became the state chess, debate and science fair champion, made it to all state in violin, and one tier below the professional orchestra at NEC. They didn't even go to my state debate champion awards ceremony. I remember standing alone outside waiting to be picked up while the second and even fifth place winners walked out with their happy parents. I cried, and when my father took me home he beat me for crying. I got straight As, I got a perfect score on the PSAT and a 2360 on the SAT. I took every single AP class at once and even took all of Harvard's undergraduate curriculum for biology while still in high school. It didn't matter. Nothing was ever good enough for them. Success wasn't to be rewarded. It was expected. The only time my father ever told me he was proud of me was when I got into caltech, which was immediately followed by his profound disappointment that I did not get into Harvard. I was only allowed to listen to classical music and was not allowed to hang out with other kids except christian kids and only on special occasions during christian potlucks. We only wore khaki pants and polo shirts, with the pants pulled up very high so we didn't look like \"gangsters with saggy jeans\". Dating was forbidden, and any sexual confusion was just ignored and treated like a mysterious evil curse. \n\nBecause my grandfather was both a pastor and military policeman with old ROC values, my father was just as strict and frugal. We had descended from the \"Dragon\" family line of generals stretching far back into history. We were to assemble at attention in a line instantly when called within 10 seconds or be beaten. No heat on the coldest nights and no air conditioning on the hottest days. Showers should only take 1 minute. We were not allowed to have food preferences. All food had been graciously provided by god, they said. He would buy clothes too big for us meant to last ten years. No TV. No celebrations on sinful american holidays. We were to forgo earthly needs, because \"man did not live on bread alone.\" Often, dinner consisted of a $1 hot dog wrapped in a kraft cheese single with one piece of white bread and a slice of lettuce. We ate rice gruel often. To this day I have a preference for super cheap food, like eating plain rice with just soy sauce and sesame oil. Because he didn't believe in women's rights or birth control, my mother kept having children. I had 4 other siblings. This made us very poor. Sometimes all we had to eat were saltines and condiments that we took from the free section of wendy's. We lived in a barn infested with bugs and were the poorest kids in town. I remember one time I asked my mother if we could give a friend a ride two blocks down and she screamed at me and then broke down in tears, saying we were running out of gas for the month and that my dad had to get to work. When things finally did get better, my dad said he would buy us an xbox if we could beat him in chess. When we beat him, he said instead that we had to win a tournament. When we finally got the console, he made us play The Bible Game on it, banned most violent games, and play DDR to exercise but only on songs that he approved of.\n\nBecause god had let the Israelites wander for 40 years as punishment until every person older than 18 died, my parents took that to mean that children weren't considered humans yet who could really make judgements they could be held accountable for. They basically thought we had no human rights of our own. My family made Tiger Mom look like Barney.\n\nBecause I had almost died when I was two months old to pneumonia, my parents had declared me a sacrifice to god, a Nazirite, if I were to survive. \"You are a priest forever, in the name of Melchizedek\", they told me. My life was not my own, because I had already died and this new life belonged to god. They named me Long Zhan in Chinese, meaning Dragon Warrior, and Genesis in english. I was to wear the armor of god and wage holy war against Satan. Ironically it basically meant my names were Genesis and Revelation, since revelation is often known as the dragon war. Which meant they named me Alpha and Omega, or god.\n\nOne day I stumbled upon a book in my father's study, where he kept his books from college. I read Nietzche's Beyond Good And Evil, thinking it was a christian book. When I finished reading it, everything changed. The things he said made too much sense for me to ignore.\n\nTHERE IS NO GOD kept flashing in my mind. I couldn't ignore it. I tried to force myself to believe in god and become christian again but it didn't work. I tried praying, but god wasn't there.\n\nI hid my new beliefs. I knew what would happen if my parents, who often told me that a wicked child should be stoned to death, found out. They often said they would rather kill me with their bare hands than raise an atheist.\n\nIt came to a head one day in middle school when I couldn't deal with a meaningless life anymore. I snuck away during worship and hid under a staircase, repeating to myself in shock \"what's the point?\"\n\nMy friend Katherine found me there. She understood. She was also dealing with hidden depression. We sat in our misery for hours. Before that moment, it seemed everyone was in paradise. That they were the dancing figures on the walls in Plato's cave that I was once a part of. It seemed all of them faced forward and that somehow I had looked backwards and found the void of nothingness behind their paradise that nobody else saw. But when I asked her what we could do, she didn't know how to answer either. We were blind leading the blind.\n\nToday I know this feeling isn't rare and that I wasn't alone. But because I was so isolated by christian rules, I didn't know of anything else in the world. I didn't know that the somber \"why bother\" of nihilism could be interpreted as the adventurous \"why not?\" I was an echo chamber of my own dark thoughts, with no-one to guide me. The only wise people were philosophers I read after Nietzche like Kant, and they were all dead. They couldn't talk to me. It was a long time before I would ever discover Nagel and Camus or the freedom of absurdism. Everyone I knew was christian. We had spent years shunning non-christians and the world outside my bubble was classified under a ubiquitous fog of war.\n\nWhen my father found me under the stairs he yelled at me for embarrassing him in the church and beat me when I got home. Slowly, they began to suspect that I was no longer christian. I remember making armor out of cardboard and wood in secret to protect against my father's blows. I remember making a runaway kit.  I remember running for my life up into the attic to keep my mother from killing me with a kitchen knife and calling the police while holding the door shut with my feet as she clawed at it. I remember fighting my father with a chair and cooking pot when he came for me with a metal bat.\n\nA friend of mine sent me the song Numb. I know that song saved me. It finally told me that someone else out there had dealt with this and come out with this beautiful song. It told me that the veneer of constant serenity of christianity I had forgotten I had even put up was a farce, that sometimes it was okay to be upset and mad and to punch a wall and let out all of these feelings instead of letting them eat me up. That it was preferable to feel anything, even bad things, instead of nothing, because then I valued the good more. The sonorific screams cut through my numbness.\n\nI remember sneaking up at 5am at night to play Morrowind to deal with stress while listening to Meteora on my cd player in secret and all the candy bars I had to sell at school to buy new batteries. I remember how when I entered portal temples Easier To Run would somehow always play as the sun rose outside my window, like it was telling me someday I would be free. To this day that song still pops up in my mind unbidden every time the sun rises. I listened to that CD player until it stopped spinning. I remember how I danced to Faint and went wild so I wouldn't be ignored anymore, how I longed for Somewhere I Belong and my heart soared when the ghostly echo of \"heal\" sounded. I remember being inspired to draw gothic art of monsters by Papercut, and how my mother poured oil on it and threw it in the trash. Years later when my sister took art lessons, I snuck something I drew to her teacher. He told me I had more talent than my sister did, said it to my mother's face. And my sister won the congressional national competition and her art is hanging in capitol hill. He made my sister use my other art pieces as the basis for her next few pieces, that I had given to my friend Annette in a folder so that it wouldn't be found in my house.\n\nToday, I'm a scientist and a breakdancer with zero signs of depression. I pushed through despite my parents not supporting my desire to be a biologist because they didn't believe in evolution, or thinking that breakdancing was just something that homeless black gangsters did while rolling around dirty floors. I taught myself bioinformatics in the kitchen, did research by hand that others did on computers or in the lab. I learned to do dangerous moves on concrete. Linkin Park saved my life. I have never cared for celebrity news before but somehow I am genuinely sad at Chester's passing because this man who saved me had no one to save him and I feel almost guilty.",

    "body": "This is...really sad.  This post is kind of a mess because I was trying to find information about this show while I wrote it and I kept going back and adding information.  Sorry about that.\n\nSo, I met these guys right before the release of Hybrid Theory.  They were an opening act...\n\n...I can't think of who the headliner was though...Found it!  Looks like I was there to see Twiztid and Kottonmouth Kings - no wonder I couldn't really remember that part of the show.  I was going though a juggalo phase, think of that what you will.  Oh yeah, ReHab was there and at that time they were this corny rap group who actually had strippers that toured with them.  Same songs, but they sounded completely different.\n\nRight - they were opening that tour (I don't think anyone was there to see them, in fact) at a little club in Winston Salem, NC:  Ziggy's.  It's closed now but they used to have some amazing shows.  I saw acts from Hank Williams III to Deftones to Weezer to ICP there, it was a really kind of \"close\" space - just about anywhere you were, it felt like you could reach out and touch the people on stage.\n\n...or at least get fully doused in Faygo\n\nAnyway, their show - this would have been around mid-to-late 1999 (found it!  Looking through setlist.fm - it was September 18th, 2000) was just amazing, partly because of the venue but largely because of their performance.\n\nThere couldn't have been more than a couple of dozen people in the place for their show, but it was probably one of the tightest live performances I've *ever* seen - and I've helped run sound for acts like MDC, Jucifer, Skeleton Witch, and plenty of others - not to mention the shows I've attended as an audience member.\n\nThe guitar player wore headphones.  I've never seen anyone else do that.  The \"DJ\" didn't just do the record-scratching that it seemed all other rap-rock-metal-alternative-Bizkit-bands did around then.  He was live-sampling and mixing the levels of the other members on stage.  The synergy between them was on another level.  The live sound was pretty much album-quality, but it was right *there*...\n\nI told them as much after the show.  They were humble, gracious, and extremely nice.  I told them straight up:  You guys are going to be selling out arenas before too much longer.  I'm paraphrasing here, but Chester said something like \"that would be amazing, but I don't really think so.  We've been doing this kind of thing for a while now and we just love going around and playing for people who are into the music.\"  It seemed like they weren't thinking \"what does the radio want, how can we sell a hundred million records?\" - they were more like \"this is what we sound like when we do what we love, enjoy it with us.\n\nChester and Mike signed two demo tapes for me.  I've still got them.  Besides tshirts, posters, and other random merch that I've been given by bands who I've booked or done stage work for, I don't really have any other \"memorabilia\" - just those two tapes.  I stopped paying attention to them well over a decade ago.  I just wasn't into the sound anymore, to be honest - tastes change.  I still think the first record is brilliant, and the second record is pretty great too - those songs will always remind me of my early years in the Marines.  Someone was almost always blasting one of those CDs during field day.\n\nI mopped so many floors to those tracks.\n\nI wish he hadn't gone so soon.  He was full of music, and poetry.  Maybe it was a bit on-the-nose, a bit too much angst...too much anger, resentment, and other vague but passionate feelings towards an undefined \"you.\"  Some might say that's simplistic, formulaic - but it allows for the listener to place themselves in the narrative of the song, and recognize the things that they're feeling - and know by extension that they're not alone.  As an angsty young guy with too many hormones and too little life experience, it was very therapeutic sometimes to just turn the volume up and scream along.  I know I'm not alone in this either - I've seen you doing the same thing when I drive by you in traffic, don't try to deny it.\n\nIt's just a shame that the man who wrote those words couldn't find the same solace in them that they conveyed to so many others.\n\nI could close this out with almost any couple of lines from one of their songs, but I don't want to pick just one.  So go hit up YouTube, dig deep into your mp3 library, or even dust off an old CD and play a song or two for yourself...and enjoy the music.  That's what he told me was most important, and I think that's the kind of farewell he would have wanted.",

He was angry at being called a sell out and was confrontational. He seemed genuinely angry and was lashing out constantly. A redditor below said that in recent shows, fans would throw bottles at them when they played their new singles.\n\nThen his best friend Chris Cornell dies, and it's his birthday today. I wonder if it was all too much for him. Since he took his life the same way Chris did, and on his birthday.\n\nAs someone that did not like their new album, I feel fuckin awful. I know I wasn't an asshole about it, and I have a right to be critical. But as someone that grew up with their music (Hybrid theory and Meteora were huge in middle school) - I can't help but feel awful.\n\n**EDIT:**\n\nI apologize if I opened up a debate about criticism. This is a touchy subject given Chester just died. But to be clear, I'm only talking about myself on a personal level in my post.\n\nI didn't mean to make others feel guilty for not liking an album. It's perfectly okay to not like art and to even be critical of it. I think we all know the difference between being critical - and being an asshole. Attacking him and yelling he's a sell out on twitter - because he made music you didn't like - that is not valid criticism. That is malicious. That isn't the same as not liking an album, and being critical.\n\nI'm sorry if I pushed this conversation into another direction. I've been crying non stop, and I can't help but feel a lot of emotions. I personally feel guilt - but it's not rational. It's just a personal thing I'm feeling. I didn't mean for others to feel that.\n\nI also wanted to say that, we fans (regardless if you hated some of their work) - should be supporting each other and not taking out our emotions on each other. At the end of the day, we all loved a piece of who they are. We all loved what Chester could create. It doesn't matter if we all don't love the same things.\n\n*hugs*\n\nI love you guys \n\nI'm sorry.\n\n\n\n",

I have each on of their tracks. Even the demos. Linkin Park helped me get through some rough times. I remember feeling so connected with Crawling, One Step Closer etc. For two straight years I listened to only Linkin Park. Yes it was kiddish, but it helped me through so much. I cant believe that I am crying. \n\nLP got me into music. The guitar I use is a PRS, because Brad used it. \n\nWhat really made LP different? I am going to say Chester. He poured his heart into singing. The guy has been thorough so much. Every single lyric he sang had some sort of angst, and he conveyed it so well.\n\nHas anyone heard of 'Breaking the Habit\"? Chester couldnt sing that song for a year after it was released because it was so personal. \n\nHe was my Idol. I never got too see LP live, but I will be youtubing every concert I can find.\n\nRIP Chester. You helped me, and so many of us get through the tough times, and we hope you are in a better place.",

That blossomed into my adoration of all different genres of metal, which got me into playing musical instruments. Playing music gave me a greater respect for the talent that goes into ALL genres of music and really broadened my horizon for what I listen to.

I gotta write this.\n\nHybrid Theory on CD was mine the week it came out, and Linkin Park immediately became a foundational pillar of my musical world. I was 13 at the time. Over the years, I have never lost faith in them or hated them. The only album I haven't loved is The Hunting Party. I adore every other main album of theirs for various reasons.\n\nI fucking LOVE One More Light. The band was never, ever afraid of exploring and trying new sounds. Sell outs? Nah, they morphed their music as they grew as people, and appropriately so.\n\nQuick story: my father was arrested for some real shit when I was in high school, and my family's perfect little suburban Americana life was irrevocably upended. This was soon after Meteora came out, and in my deep depression of immediate post-father-arrest, I became severely attached to the song Breaking the Habit. I would play it on repeat for days and days on my speakers, with my bedroom's door shut and locked (the key to open it always available on the door frame, of course - house rules). My poor mother was worried sick about my intentions, obviously. Back then, I wasn't even considering harming myself, but in retrospect it's completely understandable why she thought so, especially with that song. But goddamnit it helped me cope, and that song is the single most important song in my entire life, and a complete demonstration of how music can heal.\n\nWriting this post has reduced me to tears, and they aren't manly tears, they are pure tears of sadness and pain. I'll be selfish here, realizing his band mates (family of choice) and wives and children hurt so much worse, but goddamnit I lost something so special and dear to me today.\n\nI love you, Chester, thank you. I love you, Linkin Park, thank you.\n\nIn case you ask, I'd rather not talk about pops' arrest, thanks.\n\nEdit: missing word",

    "body": "A little late to this, but it's imperative to remember that while Chester Bennington's suicide is tragic, he was also a survivor of repeated sexual abuse as a child from ages 7-13. He bravely battled depression, body dysmorphia, shame, substance abuse and suicidal thoughts for nearly 30 years; and chose to channel that trauma and anger into his art - something I could certainly relate to (and admire) in my early adolescence. It was rare for \"Hybrid Theory\" to leave my CD player when I was 14/15. I felt less alone when I listened to that album. I felt understood. I skated to it. Linkin Park - along with Blink 182, NIN, and Marilyn Manson were much more the sound/a phase of my youth than Sound Garden, or Nirvana.\n\nWhen I look at Chester's life, the life of a tormented artist - who's effort was often ridiculed by people (including myself in my mid-twenties) who don't make anything other than critiques and criticisms - similar to Van Gogh, and David Foster Wallace (who also took their own lives) I am reminded of when I attempted to hang myself, in treatment, when I was nearly 26 years old - and ripped the lighting fixture out of the ceiling. I am reminded of the letter I had written my mother that stated \"I swear to God I tried\", congruent with Van Gogh's last letter to his brother, Theo - in which he wrote \"The sadness will last forever\".\n\nI think about how absolutely (for lack of a better word) *fucked* my life felt after overdosing, getting kicked out of grad school, and finding myself over 40k in debt. Stripped of the only coping mechanism (oxycontin) I had that worked at staving off the torment of just trying to survive. But when I thought I hit bottom, it started hitting back - and I know, from experience (I've broken a lot of bones), that there is no bruise like the bruise that loneliness kicks into your spine. Shame has an uncanny ability to warp/destroy any healthy perspective of ourselves, and our ability to be loved. It's like a shattered mirror. I thought that there was something inherently wrong with me - that I was broken/damaged - and that perspective dictated my behavior.\n\nA common misconception about \"why\" people chose to take their own lives is that they are \"weak\" or \"troubled\". And that couldn't be further from the truth.\n\nTo quote David Foster Wallace on the subject:\n\n> The so-called \"psychotically depressed\" person who tries to kill his/herself doesn\u2019t do so out of quote \"hopelessness\" or any abstract conviction that life\u2019s assets and debits do not square. And surely not because death seems suddenly appealing. The person in whom Its invisible agony reaches a certain unendurable level will kill themselves the same way a trapped person will eventually jump from the window of a burning high-rise.\n\n> Make no mistake about people who leap from burning windows. Their terror of falling from a great height is still just as great as it would be for you or me standing speculatively at the same window just checking out the view; the fear of falling remains a constant. The variable here is the other terror, the fire\u2019s flames: when the flames get close enough, falling to death becomes the slightly less terrible of two terrors. It\u2019s not desiring the fall; it\u2019s terror of the flames. And yet nobody down on the sidewalk, looking up and yelling \"Don\u2019t!\" and \"Hang on!\", can understand the jump. Not really. You\u2019d have to have personally been trapped and felt flames to really understand a terror way beyond falling.\n\n\nHaving felt those flames - and making that choice to jump, I know (now - almost 7 years later) that it was definitively the wrong choice to make. I wasn't aware of any other option. I didn't know that if I asked for help - I wouldn't just learn how to fight those flames - people would meet me in them. I was terrified that if I was honest about how I felt, and what I thought about daily - that I'd end up in drooling in the corner of a padded room - pumped full of so many anti-psychotics that I wouldn't even respond to my own name. But what I was really afraid of was feeling the weight of everything. Of beauty, darkness, and trauma. I couldn't imagine, much less live in a world that wasn't curbed by something.\n\nThese days I'm not plagued, I still have intrusive thoughts, but I promise, it does get better. I got better because I got (and continue to get) the professional help I need(ed). I feel the weight of everything, in it's entirety, and it is more than enough. \n\nI am no longer sick, **I am infected with the tremendous excitement of living, because I believe that I have the strength to bear it. I believe that you do as well.**\n\nSo if you struggle with depression, substance abuse, and/or suicidal thoughts I want you to know you are not alone. I know that there is hope because I carry it with me. And I'm not going to yell up from the street asking you to hold on. I'll meet you in the flames every time they rise.\n\nAnd I know there is a chance that the worst day may still be coming, so let me say for the record \"I'm still going to be here, asking the world to dance - even if it keeps stepping on my holy feet\".\n\nFriend, if all we have to gain in staying is each other - My God that is plenty. My God, that is enough.\n\nThat is so, so much for the light to give.\n\nPS: Please consider giving a donation to https://www.rainn.org in Chester's Memory.",

I never understood music when I was younger, it just didn't appeal to me. But when I was 16 my best friend at the time gave me Hybrid Theory to try. I fell in love.  Listened to it nonstop for months.  Ended up buying Meteora when it came out and loved that too. Thanks to my love of Linkin Park I connected with a girl I met online, who I ended up dating for 3 and a half years and almost marrying. She introduced me to other bands like Coheed and Cambria and AC/DC, which inspired me to pick up a guitar.  She's long out of my life unfortunately,  but thanks to that guitar I became an amateur musician, which lead me to becoming friends with my 2 best friends who are my life. Almost everything I am now stems from being given Hybrid Theory.  \n\nSorry for the long post, I'm just really bummed out and needed to let loose. \n",

Wait until the commotion dies down and he flies back to wherever you two go to school. When life returns to normal for everyone else, it won't for him. Be there when all the commotion is over. Invite him to things often. He will bail on you. He will 400 times. Keep being there for him and giving him opportunities to feel normal again. Maybe on that 401st time, he'll be ready to try to be normal again. I had a friend who did this for me. I asked why she kept inviting me time and time again when I would flake everytime. She said, \"I just wanted you to know that you had options.\" It meant so very much to me. Everyone faded away when my husband dying was old news then someone who I wasn't actually that close to was the one who stayed in contact just to remind me that I had options when I was ready. Be as normal as you can with him. Don't talk to him about it. Just be his friend. If he wants to talk about it, he will. Be his passage back to normal.",

And surely not because death seems suddenly appealing. The person in whom *Its* invisible agony reaches a certain unendurable level will kill herself the same way a trapped person will eventually jump from the window of a burning high-rise. Make no mistake about the people who leap from burning windows. Their terror of falling from a great height is still just as great as it would be for you or me standing speculatively at the same window, i.e. the fear of falling remains a constant. The variable here is the other terror, the fire's flames: when the flames get close enough, falling to death becomes the slightly less terrible of two terrors. It's not desiring the fall; it's terror of the flames. And yet nobody down on the sidewalk, looking up and yelling 'Don't!' and 'Hang on!', can understand the jump. Not really. You'd have to have personally been trapped and felt flames to really understand a terror way beyond falling.\n\n-Infinite Jest by David Foster Wallace",

I was an EMT suffering from traumatic stress that hit me like a freight train after my relationship disintegrated - I ended up walking down the side of a county road, with a backpack full of whatever stuff of mine I could fit in it when I got kicked out of the house, praying I'd get hit by a truck. \n\nWhen that didn't happen, I checked into a motel and tried to strangle myself in the bathroom with the hairdryer cord. That didn't work. I think they design those rooms to make them suicide proof. \n\nMy dad ended up tracking me down and took me back to his place on the other side of the country. The first night back, I got in my jeep and planned to drive it into the river - but for some reason, I decided to call that hotline. After four or five minutes, the counselor suddenly said, \"I'm sorry - I have to move on, I need to go now.\" \n\nI begged her to stay just a little longer - I thought I was going to die and I wanted to just ... talk, to anyone. Not to convince me not to, not to get pity - just to talk, one last time. \n\nShe hung up.\n\nI'm sure they have helped many, many people. And I can't imagine the vicarious trauma they bear. \n\nBut - that time, the time *I* needed them, they were god damn fucking useless.\n\nIt made me so angry, and at the time, even more hopeless - I didn't think that was possible. The irony is, I didn't kill myself that night because I was in so much despair that I passed out in my jeep from crying so hard. So I guess they saved my life. I don't think it was supposed to go like that, though.\n\n\n",

LP was, and has remained a huge part of my life and the key factor in that is Chester's unbelievably good voice. A voice that was far and above better than anything in alt-rock/ metal at the time. I truly feel devastated, like I've lost part of my childhood. His poor family :(. Rest in peace man. You and Mike Shinoda changed the game forever.\n\n\nEdit: widened age range from 24-28 to 20-34. I in no way intended to upset anyone haha. My reason for picking that age range is because that is the one where Linkin Park could have literally been the first real music you were exposed to, as was the case for me :) \n\n\nEdit 2: Before one more person grills me about \"Breaking the Habit\" and schools me on standard song structure, I would like to point out that I was 11 years old at the time and had not been versed in such things. You missed my point entirely. The point was that I was such a huge fan that I was convinced no better music existed. I no longer feel that it is the most unique song ever made. I didn't know what I was talking about then because I was a small child, but what I knew was that I loved the band and that they had a significant impact on my music growth and development.

I wanted to call into work but didn't. My gf didn't sleep much that night and she found out thru eddie Vedder's instagram and she didn't tell me cause she knew how much he meant to me. I was a huge Soundgarden and Audioslave and Temple of the Dog fan and his music shaped my musical taste and was one of the reasons I started singing and writing songs. I toughed it out that day at work and when I got home I grabbed a 6 pack and had a smoke on my back porch when I read this thing my gf sent me on fb. It was about why some people don't realise why it hurts some people so much when you lose someone like a musician you may not have met but has had so much influence in your life. They're your teachers, your philosophers, your rocks that you think are always gonna be there. They were there for you when you were down and helped you thru hard times. Im just paraphrasing but It was really beautiful and when I read that post I just started crying by myself in my porch while my daughter and gf were inside the house. I was never really big into Linkin Park but I know they also had a large fan base of people that looked up to them the way I looked up to Cornell. These guys touched a lot of people with their music and it's just so damn tragic the way their flames burnt out. \nRIP. ",

When I was working at the place I worked, we were trained to stay on the phone as long as the person needed us to, and to try to keep them talking if things escalated. It didn't matter if they weren't saying anything, or if they didn't want to talk about how they were feeling and just wanted to talk about something else. If they just wanted to sit there and listen to us speak to them, or if they just wanted to sit in silence, knowing that someone else was on the other end with them, we stayed connected. That call didn't end until the person who called wanted it to end. There were many late nights when I was the only one in the office, and I took calls that lasted an hour or longer, and I was glad to do it if there was even the smallest chance I was helping that other person in some way. I really wish that you would've had that kind of support that you needed that night.\n\nEdit: Wow, thank you so much for the gold! I wasn't expecting that.

Probably fair to say they've been my favorite band of my adult life. I was never really depressed to the point of considering suicide, but I largely thank Linkin Park for that. So many of their songs served as a great outlet for anger and depression that it never became a problem for me, in my opinion. I'm usually a little sad hearing about musicians dying: Prince, Michael Jackson, David Bowie, Chris Cornell...but this one stings. This one stings a lot.\n\nExample. Eight years ago, my wife survived a very difficult year-long battle with cancer. when I say \"difficult year-long battle with cancer,\" I mean the kind that pushed her to ask me to just kill her - and meant it - several times. A couple years later, we were flying on a plane somewhere and she asked if she could listen in to whatever I was listening to on my phone, so of course I gave her one of the ear pieces. A few minutes later, Iridescent comes on. She had never heard it before, and after a minute or so, I realized that she was really paying attention to the lyrics because tears were streaming down her face. She has generally been a much happier person since that flight.\n\nYup, this sucks.",

I used Somewhere I Belong to motivate myself to meet new people and make new friends when I moved away for college. Despite being surrounded by more people than ever before, I felt lonely and had a terrible freshman year. I used that song to envision what a better place would look like in my mind, then made it a reality by getting to know people and socializing outside of a classroom or dorm setting. \n\nNowadays, all of my closest friends are people I met that sophomore year. Linkin Park, in essence, had a huge impact on my life. \n",

LP's music has definitely helped a lot of folks and in a way, helped their fans feel belonged. \n\nThe worst part of suicide is, after they're gone they'll never know how much they were truly loved by their friends and family. It's always difficult to tell someone has severe depression by just their appearances alone. You won't know til they actually tell you. \n\nWhat's worse is that some people don't take it seriously. So theres a chance the person they confide in wont take them seriously, thus brushing off their mental illness. Afterwards, feeling hopeless, in your head it would just be easier to put on a mask everyday and pretend life is great than have to go through that again. \n\nSorry for the rant, but i'd really like those who are suffering from depression, that suicide is not the option and to seek help. And most importantly there are people who do love and care for you.\n\nAs the fortune said from a fortune cookie I got awhile back, \"There's always a way out\"...",
