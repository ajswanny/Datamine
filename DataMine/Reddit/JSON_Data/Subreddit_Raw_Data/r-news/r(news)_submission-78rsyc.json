He had already been heavily into cocaine, sex and drugs and was being molested by another in Hollywood even the night before he says MJ showed him that medical book (while the two were preparing to travel on an impromptu getaway). \n\nWhat *is* disturbing and inappropriate is how the investigators turned a completely blind eye to Corey's actual accusations of being molested when he advised them it was **not MJ** but someone else. He writes in his book about being interrogated by investigators after the original MJ scandal broke:\n\n> **The audiotapes have long since been leaked to the press\u2014I clearly stated that Michael never touched me, never acted in any way inappropriate. What\u2019s incredible about them, however, is that I admitted that I had been molested; I even named my abuser. The sergeant peppering me with questions, Deborah Linden, breezed right past that. She didn\u2019t seem the least bit interested.**\n\nCorey also notes that after being drugged and molested by one man:\n\n> **I was shattered, disgusted, devastated. I needed some normalcy in my life. So, I called Michael Jackson. Michael Jackson\u2019s world, crazy as it sounds, had become my happy place.**\n\nCorey had a falling out with MJ on 9/11 amidst MJ and the family departing from NYC immediately after the attacks (based on a later dismissed rumor the day prior that Corey planned to write a book about MJ). He held some resentment toward MJ for years after that and regularly said things negatively about him in the media, sensationalizing at times and even writing a song about him. But he maintained nothing inappropriate had happened.",

I mean, it's quite an accusation and it can ruin peoples lives, it has ruined peoples lives and I'll even argue it ruined Michael Jacksons life.  \n\nAnyways, I really suggest checking [this post out.](https://np.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/3n3rio/did_michael_jackson_actually_molest_kids/cvknk28/)  It made me really rethink the accusations hurled at MJ and I think anyone that's willing to even suggest he was abusive to children, should at least read it extensively before making the accusation and furthering what has become part of this poor mans legacy.  And when I say extensively, I mean read the sources the guy lists.  It just seems like its all there and we should have seen it so much earlier and its fucking crippling to think MJ went to the grave with most of the world thinking he was the very thing he was trying to protect children from in the first place because of what had happened to him in his own childhood.",

She's plainly stating what he's up against, not in order to shame him, but to help lend gravity to what he's doing. Go watch just about any 60 minutes interview and you'll see her doing this all the time.\n\n> It's like if you were trying to say that you're jumping out of a plane and an interviewer says \"You're risking your life.\" they don't mean to say that you shouldn't do it, they mean to help direct the audiences understanding of the gravity of what you're doing. That's the role of the interviewer and this is how Barbara Walters has always done it.\n\nEDIT: for the record, since this is getting a lot of attention, I ardently support Corey, and survivors, and if I thought Barbara Walters was actually trying to put that blame on Corey I would have no problem throwing her to the wolves. It's just that, having watched a lot of Barbara over the years (and, I'm not saying she can't be an insufferable bitch, because she can be) I Just don't think that was her intent here. \n\nEDIT 2: I don't have time to look through more, but the first one I looked at had a pretty good example. if you watch her talk to MJ about [Princess Diana's death and his feelings about the paparazzi](https://youtu.be/QjEdS0aSgRw?t=298), it seems like she's being super insensitive by badgering about him why he shouldn't expect privacy. She makes a very clear statement that he shouldn't expect privacy because he benefits from notoriety, but within the context of hte video its obvious that she's not trying to be cruel, she's trying to lend gravity to context of hte discussion they're having. She's not giving her opinion, that's not her role. She knows that nobody cares about her opinion. She's trying to direct the context of the interview.\n\nedit 3: er, I said 60 minutes but I meant 20/20",

It was a rumour, but people didn't actually know he was. Are you really going to believe a single 13 year old audience member who comes out without any evidence straight away? No, you wouldn't. You'd try and investigate, as many friends of mine did, but if every other victim stays quiet, via either continuing to trust his promises of \"I'll make you famous\" or threats of \"I'll ruin your life\", then sadly you don't believe the victim and just ignore it. And that's how the rumours start, from a lighting grip saying \"I heard x is investigating Saville for being a paedo\". So when people say it was public knowledge, it wasn't. We heard rumours, but rumours without evidence. There's a difference between 'I heard' and 'I knew'.

    "body": "The user's name was /u/jonloovox.  Here's the comment in full.  I've copied/pasted in other threads as well, but he's the author:\n\nThe story is rather tragic. I do believe that had the internet existed in 1994 in it's current form, Jackson would still be alive today. Jackson was very much the victim of public perception. Yes, he was clearly an eccentric with many quirks, but the \"child molestation\" thing was hogwash. GQ published a non-bias article in 1994 entitled \"Was Michael Jackson Framed?\" that you can find all over the net. Here's one link: http://floacist.wordpress.com/2007/08/22/gq-article-was-michael-jackson-framed/ ... It's a pretty fascinating read that details exactly what happened during that first accusation. Most people haven't read it, though... because it's easier and more \"interesting\" (and at the time, \"funnier\") to imagine him as some kind of freak.\n\nAnyone unfamiliar with what actually happened there, I'd really recommend reading it. The TL;DR: version is pretty god damn fucked up. He befriended a young boy, his mother and step-father. The biological father wanted money to produce \"Robin Hood Men In Tights\" so he brainwashed his son with sodium Amytal in an attempt to extort money out of Jackson... knowing full-well he wouldn't want to go through a long career-tarnishing trial. There's taped conversations between the father and step-father where the father lays out his entire plan.\n\n\u201cAnd if I go through with this, I win big-time. There\u2019s no way I lose. I\u2019ve checked that inside out. I will get everything I want, and they will be destroyed forever. June will lose [custody of the son]\u2026and Michael\u2019s career will be over.\u201d\n\nIt's whack. Seriously... read it. FYI, the father ended up killing himself in 2009 only 5 months after Jackson died: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evan_Chandler\n\nMy point is, public perception in 1994 was so heavily dependent on shock media, magazine covers, radio, talk show monologues, etc. Had Reddit existed back then, we would have seen the smoking gun. People would be chatting over the details on a daily basis. It would have been very difficult for the public to remain that misinformed and warped by rumor and heresay.\n\nBut the perception stuck. And clearly it weighed heavily on Jackson... someone who had dedicated his life to helping children in need. He was clearly depressed. He turned to drugs. As we later found out, he needed to be medicated to even sleep. I can't imagine what that had to have been like..\n\nThat was the only time anyone ever accused Jackson of wrongdoing... until 11 years later in 2005, but this time it was CLEARLY bullshit and a clear attempt at extortion. Anyone following that trial was aware of how ridiculous the claims were. I'll summarize. It was right after the huge documentary \"Living with Michael Jackson\" that Martin Bashir did. Jackson was all over the news for the \"baby dangling\" incident. In the documentary, it showed that Jackson took in a young cancer patient, his mother and sister and was paying for the boy's treatment (last I heard, he's now cancer-free). He was close with the boy and the family. It made the news, because of the scene where Jackson says, \"What's wrong with sharing a bed with someone you love?\" in reference to the young boy. The public took it (or twisted it) to be a sexual thing... Jackson intended it as an innocent remark... hanging out late playing video games on a massive bed and someone passes out. Inappropriate? Maybe. Molestation? No. Anyways... the mother of the boy had been in and out of mental institutions and had attempted to con money from celebrities in the past (the reason for Jay Leno and George Lopez being at the trial). She also claimed her family had been \"sexually fondled\" by JC Penny security after her punk kids shoplifted... she settled out of court for $152k. So anyhow, the Bashir documentary was a shitshow, people like Gloria Allred were petitioning to have Jackson's kids taken away... and Jackson's handlers told him to distance himself from the young boy and the family... so he cut them off. It was only after that, that the woman and the boy accused Jackson of misconduct. The funny part was, they literally claimed the molestation started AFTER the documentary aired. As if Jackson hung out with the kid, let them live at Neverland, passed out playing videogames, filmed a documentary admitting that it was innocent... and then when the entire world started looking at the relationship with a magnifying glass and wanted to take away Jackson's kids (and apparently the family had already been interviewed by police)... THAT's when Jackson decided to start molesting the kid. Come on... Whole thing was a crock of shit. The woman also claimed they were held hostage at Neverland... to which they pulled up the creditcard receipts showing all the shopping sprees she was doing with Jackson's money during the \"kidnapping\". At one point they point out, \"How could you be kidnapped if you were shopping at Nordstroms, Tiffanys... here's a receipt for a body wax\". The woman snapped back , \"IT WASN'T A BODY WAX!!! IT WAS A LEG WAX!! HE'S LYING TO YOU!!!\" .... Total shitshow. Read up on it. It's was fucked. You can read most of this on wiki: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial_of_Michael_Jackson\n\nThat 2005 Trial doesn't happen without the 1993 situation. It was the same DA (Tom Sneddon) who tried to get Jackson in 1993 that was pushing for the 2005 thing. It was only mildly plausible, because of the 1993 thing. They tried to find other boys to step forward (out of the thousands who Jackson had been in contact with over the years) and nobody stepped forward. They had a former body guard (who had sold his story to National Enquirer and had previously been arrested for armed robbery) claim he saw Jackson blowing Macauley Culkin in a shower... they brought Culkin up there to respond and he's like, \"WUT?\" ... As one journalist put it:\n\n\"the trial featured perhaps the most compromised collection of prosecution witnesses ever assembled in an American criminal case...the chief drama of the trial quickly turned into a race to see if the DA could manage to put all of his witnesses on the stand without getting any of them removed from the courthouse in manacles.\"\"\n\nNobody following that trial was surprised by the outcome.\n\nIt's some sad stuff, man. Despite this, the perception stuck. People continued to hate him and paint him as a monster. People continued to take the rumors and tabloid gossip as truth... and I think ultimately it killed him.\n\nEdit: I should admit I'm slightly bias... my cousin spent a lot of time at Neverland hanging out with MJ when she was a kid and she said it was ALWAYS filled with children (mostly underprivileged kids, children with disabilities or sickness) and that Jackson was a fucking saint. She's still depressed about his death and doesn't like talking about it.\n\nEdit 2: Someone forwarded this to me. A short interview from 2003 with the author of that GQ article (Mary A Fischer) right after the second allegations broke: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIxU3cWkqW0 ... In the interview, she points out a detail I forgot. In both the 1993 and 2003 allegations, the parents' first instinct wasn't to go to police... but to lawyer up. In both instances, they went to the same lawyer (Larry Feldman) who specializes in civil litigation. Strange behavior if you actually think your kid has been abused.\n\nEdit 3: Regarding 2016 child porn allegations: That was a false story fabricated by the tabloid Radar Online.\n\nAlmost immediately after the \"report\" went viral, the police department who did the investigation, denied releasing any report.\n\nAll the porn that was found in MJ's possession was presented at the 2005 trial. Not only was there no child porn, but all of it was heterosexual adult porn.\n\nhttp://michaeljacksonallegations.com/books-magazines-and-internet-material-found-in-michael-jacksons-possession/\n\nThe prosecution spent days displaying the magazines that they had confiscated from Jackson\u2019s bedroom on a big screen. Observers wondered what point they were trying to make with the detailed, graphic presentation of this completely legal collection that only pointed to Jackson\u2019s sexual interest in women, other than perhaps trying to publicly humiliate him and prejudice the conservative jury against him in the absence of real, relevant evidence.\n\nOh, and the FBI investigated Michael for 15 years. Not one shred of evidence of child molestation or child porn was ever found.\n\nCan't believe that even years after his death - tabloids continue to fabricate stories about him. Just disgusting.\n",
