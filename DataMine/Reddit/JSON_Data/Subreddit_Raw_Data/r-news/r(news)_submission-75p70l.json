I can however be moved, and has been in the past, last in 1986 when Mexico took over as hosts instead of Colombia, who in 1983, 9 years after having been chosen as hosts, declared that they would not be able to host it, due to economical reasons. \n\nBut for Qatar to lose the host status of the 2022 World Cup would probably either require Qatar to go bankrupt, not being able to finish the vast majority of their preparations, them being embargoed by an institution like the UN and banned from international sports (like Yugoslavia was in the early 1990's), or perhaps all out war.\n\nHowever, the only even remotely realistic option of the above would probably be Qatar being unable to finish their preparations in time, building 11 stadiums from scratch, and greatly expanding the 12th, is a herculean task after all. On the other hand, if they fall too far behind schedule, they'd probably just whip their slaves building the stadiums a bit harder, hire more international leadership talent to oversee the construction, and outbid everyone on the international market for any required materials. \n\nThe allegations of bribery of FIFA officials, the extreme heat which will make the tournament near impossible to play, the horrible scheduling issues that a winter World Cup would create, Qatar's horrible human rights abuses will all be ignored (or encouraged) by FIFA. FIFA will only strong arm Qatar on the area of the sale of alcohol, so they can get their beer sponsor for the event.",

Paul Manafort learned of this plan after successfully implanting a truth serum into a pracrice ball. After a routine drill, Manafort, disguised as a tiny orange cone, abducted Howard and interrogated him, thus uncovering Mueller's plot. Manafort then used the same technology employed by the Mon-Stars of space Jam to drain team USA of their skills prior to last night's game. The result: a USA loss, and no Trump-Putin meeting.",

Physical attributes/talent are not a factor until after puberty.\n\nAt 18 your training should be finished and you should be ready to play 1st team football in a decent league if you want to become an alright player.

I can treat it as episodic content, perhaps missing some episodes and I don't care - can just relax.  If you're checking reviews, it looks like a lot of reviewers are critical of it because they see it as a poorly executed comedy.. but it actually isn't a comedy - it's just a show with occasional levity, and I suppose that makes them uncomfortable.  Perhaps they don't quite understand what was going on when Seth MacFarlane funded the reboot of COSMOS (which as an aside, is far worse than the original - but with Carl Sagan dead, that's forgivable).  He is apparently a space+science fan and so it makes sense that he's aiming more for that, rather than just using it as a backdrop for comedy.",

Behind track and field baseball is probably the second fastest growing sport amongst youths right now. It is growing in popularity so rapidly that is actually shocks me. I don't spend much time in youth sports and each time I see the popularity stats it blows me away that baseball is growing so fast.\n\nPopularity of soccer has been waning recently after many years of growth, and this World Cup loss is really a much bigger disaster for the sport than people are giving credit. With other sports gaining in popularity and soccer losing its primary advertisement to kids, this could really set the sport back for decades.",

My dad, a former member of a motorcycle gang, and devout hater of most things even remotely \"punk\" or \"alternative\", was waving a finger and shouting at Wayne.\n\n\nMy friends and I immediately rushed over to diffuse the situation however we could-- my dad sort of had a reputation for starting shit with dudes when drinking. When we got within earshot, we all watched horrified as my dad GRABBED Wayne Static's hand and yelled at him drunkenly: \n\n\n\"SIGN MY ARM BITCH!!\"\n\n\nWe were all (Wayne included) sort of stunned. My dad was teetering around, but continued slurring while forcing a marker into the singer's hand \"that shit was LOUD. You motherfuckers rocked. I'm gettin this tattooed tomorrow!\"\n\n\nWayne signed, but my dad sadly did not get the signature tattooed on him-- he DID however pass-the-hell out in the car with the engine running while waiting for us/for the show to end. All of my friends were worried he was dead from carbon monoxide poisoning or something, but that's just my dad for you-- class act all around.",
