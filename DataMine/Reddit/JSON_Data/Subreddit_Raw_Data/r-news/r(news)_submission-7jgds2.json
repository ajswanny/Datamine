Three Republican senators combined to kill the Obamacare repeal. Now, the party has to get all but two of its members behind any initiative it wants to pass.\n\nOne of the important features of the Jones-Moore campaign is that even though the Democrat was running in a heavily Republican state, he was not forced to take any stands that really differ from Democratic orthodoxy. He made no specific commitments to back any part of Trump\u2019s agenda. He is likely to be the 49th \u201cno\u201d vote on most Trump initiatives.\n\nAnd Jones will have this seat until Nov. 2020, so he will not face much immediate electoral pressure. He can, at least for a bit, be more liberal on issues than senators like West Virginia\u2019s Joe Manchin, who is up for election this coming November.\n",

Hell, maybe an app on your phone to display the voter ID that can be accepted at the ballot box.
