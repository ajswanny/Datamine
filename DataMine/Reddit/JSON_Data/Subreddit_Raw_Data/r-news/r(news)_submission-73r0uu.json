Any others, please donate to a charity (for this, Puerto Rico, Houston, Environmental etc. /hugs)\n\n\n1. Turn your body sideways so your ribs won't get crushed (and put your hands on your hips to point your elbows and make a diamond so you can breath and people will push /slide past you rather than crush your chest). If you can't rotate sideways, keep your arms a few inches from your chest (lock fingers) and make a diamond so you can make a diamond/space to breath easier than if your arms are away from your body pushing. Try not to push others, you want to keep a slow steady pace toward the exit.\n\n\n2. Look for alternate exits (kitchen, side rooms etc.). \n\n\n3. Most people will run straight toward the exits and create a jam. Consider going to a wall and moving along it until you reach the exit. Edit: Because most people will go toward an exit, this leaves the outside of the room easier to navigate. You can use the wall for navigation if it's dark/smoky and if people do push you near a wall, you can use the wall for support/push back to make a diamond easier than if you push off (another person). The wall also ensures a safe side / danger would come from only 180 degrees vs 360 if you were in the center of the room.\n\n\n4. If you fall, curl up into a fetal position (back towards sky) before trying to stand. Your legs are stronger than your arms and will help you get back up better than your arms.\n\n\n5. Remain calm, DO NOT PANIC. You need to keep a clear mind to make good decisions and to be aware of what's occurring.",

About 20 minutes pass and they tell us theres an active shooter on the strip, which is very close to the airport.\n\nAirport is still on lockdown, weve been parked again and are not allowed out of the aircraft.\n\nMy prayers go out to all people involved in this horrible situation, and to those waiting to hear from your loved ones.

I was pretty shocked to find out that some family friends had died at this event, and what was even worse was their injuries were totally treatable yet they passed away because of the chaos and struggle to get immediate medical attention.

My first thought was \"huh, that's gunfire\". I've seen it and heard it many times. Then a pause and my brain was saying \"nah, too many rounds, must be construction\". Then more gunfire.  Pause, more.  Pause.  More.  Pause.  More... for a good two minutes. \n\nAt that point I'm convinced it's a jackhammer.  I'm thinking \"crap, who's doing work this late. Well, off to get food\". \n\nElevators weren't working not two minutes after I heard the gunfire. Buttons didn't even light up. After about five minutes, I tried three stairway doors.  Keycard didn't work.  Now I'm thinking something is up. Tried the hallway phone and waited on hold for ten minutes. Went back to my room and heard the helicopters. Looked out at a road full of red and blue flashers. \n\nOh. Those were gunshots!  Turned on TV... yep. Wait, FROM the Mandalay...  \n\nAbout that time I heard a maintenance guy in the hallway telling his wife he's safe and on floor (mine) and that someone on 32 blew out their window and was spraying down into the concert crowd. He saw me and said to get back in my room. Confirmed hotel is in total lockdown. \n\nJust a few minutes ago, the cops swept through the floor. You could hear their radios. Must have been three. They stopped at my door, banged on it, announced it was the police, said they heard the TV and asked my name. I gave it, didn't open the door.  I heard one of the others say \"confirmed\" and they banged on the door across the hall, did the same, got their name and moved on. \n\nThat surprised me. It was a good hour after the gunfire. \n\nEven most of the cruisers had moved on by then. Copters are a few streets over.  \n\nI wonder if the NetApp Insight conference is on for this morning...",

    "body": "Some important things to know about machine guns or guns in general. I do not want to get into a gun talk or political discussion just stating some facts as most people don't know.\n\nMachine guns are both legal and illegal to own. Legislation called the [National Firearms Act of 1934](https://www.atf.gov/rules-and-regulations/national-firearms-act) made it illegal to own machine guns without a hefty fee of $200 (roughly $4000 in today's money, though the fee has no changed) and an extensive background check which currently lasts in excessive of a year on average. On top of that you are expected to maintain individual ownership of the item as well as prevent others from handling it outside of your supervision. This also applies to suppressors, short barreled shotguns/rifles, and destructive devices like grenades and firearms that shoot cartridges over the size of a 50 cal. The idea was during prohibition that the crime syndicates of that time are able to gain easy access to a lot of these items because they weren't regulated. By creating this super crazy fee that most people couldn't pay most of the crime syndicates wouldn't have as easy of access to these items now.  \n\nSo while they are technically obtainable and legal under the proper circumstances it is not reasonable that someone is able to go off just on a whim and get a machine gun just because they want one. If caught with one of these items that going through the proper process you'd be looking at a maximum of 10 years and a maximum of $250,000 fine\n\nAs of 1986 an amendment to the act (same source link as before, just scroll down) made it so machine guns could not longer be produced new unless under the purposes of LE or Military use. That means in the last 31 years the number of machine guns on the civilian market has just become smaller (if it breaks you're SOL) as well as small supply created a huge price increase. If the said gun was something an m16 or m4 you would be talking at the minimum of $10,000 though likely 2-4x that.  \n\nUnder those circumstances it's really unlikely that someone would have spent all that money and planned a year in advance to terrorize a small concert. The unfortunate part of these regulations is while they work really well most of the time they don't prevent  someone from making or modifying existing parts to go full auto. Even if it is highly illegal. Just like drugs if you know the recipe you can make it behind closed door without getting caught.  \n\nPersonally what it sounds like from one of the twitter videos is maybe a bumpfire stock. It really is hard to tell given I do not have anything more than minor minor experience with legit full auto. After looking up videos of \"runaway\" full autos, real full autos, and bumpfire it just seems like a more legit possibility. ~~that someone made their gun a runaway train of sorts. Typically, we recommend people don't file or polish their trigger parts because if you do it improperly it could accidently cause it to slip unintentionally and continue firing until the mag runs out. It is very difficult to control the aim of the muzzle and when it happens to people bad things tend to result. My coworker knew an elderly guy in the 80s whose pistol went full auto and he couldn't control it. Recoiled in a backwards rotation and shot himself in the head.~~  \n\nEdit: Couple of things I didn't think about to include. When you do go through process of getting one of these items it is now registered to you and the ATF/FBI knows you have it, knows where you have it, and ATF can visit you on a yearly basis to verify the location and accessibility of it. If an owner of one dies either there is a person it is willed to and the ATF will take possession of it until their registration and check occurs or if there is no willed person they just destroy it.\n\nAgain, I do not want to start a political side a side b thing I just want to state the facts that machine guns are not easily obtainable through legal means. Hope for the best in LE finding out what lead to his act.\n\n",

Also thank you for the gold you awesome strangers!!!\n\nEdit 4: Long line over here by Charleston but I know it will be worth the wait!\n\n\nEdit 5: Sorry for the long wait but sadly the line was too long but I got an appointment set up for the 21st.

Leave belongings behind, but take your cell phone if it is handy.\n\n***(Turn off the cell phone ringer)***\n\n * If moving, move quickly and try to stay concealed while you move.\n\n * Before you move know where you are going and look before you move.\n\nWait and listen for directions from law enforcement personnel.\n\n**Hide in a Safe Place**\n\nFind a hidden location and hide. If possible hide in a place that offers protection as well concealment.\nIf safe to do so, call the Sheriff\u2018s Office. Do not assume that someone else has reported the incident.\n\n*OTHER IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS*\n\n**If Outdoors When a Shooting Occurs**\n\n* Drop to the ground immediately, face down as flat as possible. If within 15-20 feet of a safe place or cover, duck and run to it.\n\n* Move or crawl away from gunfire, trying to utilize any obstructions between you and the gunfire. Remember that many objects of cover may conceal you from sight, but may not be bulletproof.\n\n* When you reach a place of relative safety, stay down and do not move. Do not peek or raise your head in an effort to see what may be happening.\n\n*Wait and listen for directions from law enforcement personnel.*\n\n**If Shooter is in Close Proximity**\n\n**DO NOT APPROACH THE SHOOTER** Your survival is the key component, so unless you are left with no choice you should avoid approaching the shooter. \n\n*AS A LAST RESORT TO TRY TO SAVE YOUR LIFE, FIGHT:*\n\n* Whether alone or with a group\n* Act with aggression\n* Improvise weapons\n* Commit to your actions\n\n***^/u/pagnoodle, ^who ^is ^a ^teacher ^and ^goes ^through ^active ^shooter ^drills ^every ^year ^in ^tons ^of ^different ^scenarios ^adds:***\n\n>If you see the shooter coming your way, or has entered your room find whatever you can and throw it at them continuously. Wallet, cell phone, keys, rocks, whatever. You don't have to aim to hurt them, just to distract. The natural human response is to duck when something comes your way, or at least to focus on it as a potential danger, thus taking your eyes off your other targets giving you a reasonable chance for you or someone else to get to the attacker and possibly subdue them. If you're in a room with a fire extinguisher, grab it. Shoot the contents at your attacker blinding them and inducing a coughing fit allowing you to get closer and strike them with the metal end of the fire extinguisher until they are unconscious or you've taken control of their weapon. \n\n---\n\n\n\n\n**When You Are in a Safe Place**\n\n#When public safety personnel arrives, you should:\n\n* Remain calm and follow instructions.\n\n* Raise hands and spread fingers.\n\n* Keep hands visible at all times.\n\n* Avoid making quick movements toward officers such as attempting to hold on to them for safety.\n\n* Avoid pointing, screaming and/or yelling.\n\n---\n\n[**^Here ^is ^a ^video ^by ^LA ^county ^sheriff ^outlining ^the ^main ^points**](https://youtu.be/DFQ-oxhdFjE?t=130) ^- ***^NSFW***\n\n---\n\nI will keep editing this if I find any relevant tips, please forward it to anyone in need.

Everything I saw was overlaid with repeats of the attack, I couldn't get rid of it. \n\nA big thing that helped me with the flashbacks was forcing myself to walk myself through the events mentally until I got to a safe spot. Saying \"Ok, so this happened. So I looked over here and saw this. I heard this next. I then went here, I ran over here, I heard this, I saw this, then I ran over here.\" I kept repeating that process for the entire event until I got home and knew I was safe. \n\nIt helps pull you out of it and forces you to remember that you made it to safety.

    "body": "When you bump fire a weapon you are using the recoil of the gun to make it fire rapidly. This process involves bracing the rifle with the non-trigger hand, releasing the grip on the firing hand (leaving the trigger finger in its normal position in front of the trigger), pushing the rifle forward in order to apply pressure on the trigger from the finger, and keeping the trigger finger stationary. (best description i could find from wiki)   The reason it is accelerating and decelerating is human error.  He is tightening and loosening his grip on the gun which varies how quickly the trigger is resetting allowing for the next shot to happen.  ",

I made $7.75/hour so I had concluded that in the event of a fire, I didn't make enough to be a hero. \n\n Then again, this may not be the case with smaller hotels everywhere, as this particular hotel sucked and they also didn't change the comforters in between guests, or even the sheets if they didn't \"look dirty\".

The carry just gives you the option to use lethal force if confronted.  Do not go after the bad guy.  Do not draw your weapon unless you are confronted.  The risk of drawing is people may mistake you for the shooter.  Another concealed carry person might mistake it as the shooter confronting them and they fire at you.  You might cause people to panic the wrong direction and some may end up going back to the actual shooter.  You might also be shot by police.  People might report your position and description to police causing them to spend resources finding you and causing them to believe there are multiple bad guys which might change their strategy.  In this case it may have really thrown police off due to the location of the actual shooter.  If you do find yourself confronted by the shooter and you can not get away, do shoot them.  There is a strong risk of you missing but the shooter will kill far more people so you must take it.  If you hit them and they go down, conceal your weapon again to avoid the issues listed above.  ",
