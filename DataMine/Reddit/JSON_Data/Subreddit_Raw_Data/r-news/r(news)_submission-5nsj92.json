Guy performed well and stayed there for years.\n\n* Area, area, area. If you experience things as ok in your area, it can still be screwed up in most of the country. In my area, I know there's a shortage of appropriately paying software developer jobs, and my highly talented trade worker brother-in-law was out of work for months because of issues in that field. There's segments of the country that are pretty hosed, particularly so for people on the lower rung of the experience ladder.\n\n* \"apply anyways even if you don't meet the experience requirements\" => am working now, but have applied for hundreds of jobs, I think I only got even an interview once for a job when I didn't meet the min-years, and it was largely an oversight : they wasted my time through part of the interview process before backing out and going back to the point of \"we want more logged experience\". All other interviews I had were for places where I met or nearly met the requirements. Ignoring job requirements may have been a thing in the past but it seems to not be a good strategy currently.\n\nEDIT: First gold! Thanks stranger! Also, for people asking, I'm NE coast, so this isn't job hell, and I have been working for a while.

    "body": "Yeah... This sucks. Before people shit on those who went to college but didn't study STEM or whatever, that's not even it. People could literally graduate high school with no experience and get a decent paying job 30 to 40 yrs ago. Now you have to have a degree or some sort of training (we love trades on reddit but there is a cost, time or otherwise, to learning those too) to even qualify for those same basic jobs, and there is zero guarantee you'll even get one. You've really got to be above average. \n\nAnd what was the message for college students? 1) go to college if you want a nice life and 2) \"Pick a major. As long as you have a degree people will hire you\". That's both true and not true. Lots of good jobs absolutely require a bachelor's degree, yet just because you have a bachelor's degree doesn't mean you'll get a good job. STEM and finance pay well. The rest is a crap shoot. But we still need people who study education and journalism and psychiatry and yes even philosophy and history. A free society ABSOLUTELY needs people well versed in those subjects. \n\nBut getting back, it might be easy to victim blame or say \"I got mine. Should have just did what I did\" which is of course narrow minded, egotistical, and a bit cruel. My wife and I have done well for ourselves, but we acknowledge daily how grateful we are and how lucky we are even though we did work hard and work smart. I'd rather there be more people who earned a decent wage even if they didn't work as hard as us or get as lucky. I'd like to see my friends who struggle, who aren't cut out for demanding professions at least be able to earn enough to live a good life and live a little and put some money back. \n\n\nBelieve me, if everyone found the successful path or had the good fortune to know how to be successful, there'd still a scarcity of resources so that that path would be overrun  with people wanting to have a good life, and wages would decline. Ask attorneys. \n\nI don't know all the answers, but we need wage growth all around this country. We need people who can earn a decent living and not be scared to lose everything. If that's universal basic income, or supplemental income, or whatever, then so be it. Also need to stop shitting on people beneath us. \"oh you deserve $15 for working a register at McDonald's? No way.\" shit needs to stop. Support people in their struggles. Believe me, many of the poor values come from poverty, not vice versa. ",

    "body": "Hello, 54 year here.  I'm either a part of the Boomer generation or Gen X. Or neither. It depends on which magazine you read.  I can offer you my perspective and experience since I think I was part of the transition from the \"Then\" to the \"Now\".     Boomer times: my newlywed mother and father moved to Los Angeles in the 1950's.  economy was growing like crazy. You couldn't walk down the street without being offered an aerospace job.  The guy down the street bought a house with just his meat cutter pay at small grocery store. His wife didn't work. Just him.  On my housing tract street I was at the tail end (young) age of most of those around me.  Teenagers in lousy cars who did indeed work summers jobs and part time jobs while in high school. \"Get yourself a summer job\". Easy as one two three. Out of high school they left home on their own with manual jobs or, If they were really ambitious and odd : college. Don't forget the \"MRS\" degree.  Unions help keep wages high. My cousin got a summer job at a mining plant back in the Midwest. $10 to start and all he did was push a broom. In 1970.   Still Living at home was \" the Mark of Shame!\".  \"Something's wrong with that Johnson boy. He's still living at home\".   Much of same when I was in high school.  Classmates that didn't care at school because they'd just get any job after graduation and still buy a house.  One guy was hired as a driver at UPS.  Home owner early 20's. He's thinking of retirement now.  I went to college. Two classes to start during summer.  $100.  No dorm, just commuted.  Parking was $20.  (Books were still insanely expensive. ). I worked during that time at a hardware store part time. I got one week paid vacation after a year.  Cost of college was still doable as long as lived at home and worked part time. No debt. But \nI went in a Boomer, came out a Gen X.  Sort of. Tuition kept climbing. Suddenly talk from others of taking loans.  Economic slow down.  After graduation I worked full time had trouble finding a \"real job\". The age of Permatemp was starting and fell right in the cycle. No benefits was the norm. Day off for a vacation or sick or even a holiday (prohibited from working holidays)? No pay. From one job to the other, hoping it would turn into a regular position. I moved out at 28 only because of marriage (two incomes).  I'm Ok now,  but technically I didn't have a \"real job \" until I was 38.\nThe young dudes around me? Student loans, permatemp trap.  \"Gen X\" the press said, \"unable to move out or find regular work\". This was a Very New Concept. A sign that things were Very Wrong with America, or most likely the Young People. May take? On all.this?         Unions were gone so no pressure for decent conditions.  The Boomer's boom was largely a result of the USA not having any competition in the world market.  Globalization.  Now its a race to the bottom.  Learn enough get a job so you can train your replacement from India at a fraction of pay. Automation now in manufacturing, or what's left of it.     My gosh I'm getting morose.  Better sign out. That's  enough from me.  I know your struggles, I'm not blind. And I have two millennials myself and see what's going on.  And I don't have anything to offer other than my experience. Thanks for listening. \n*edit: spelling",

    "body": "This is a predictable outcome.\n\nA huge amount of the explosive American economic growth has come from various companies turning everything into a commodity to drive down costs.\n\nAt roughly the same period, the idea of human resources was created and that is precisely what humans got turned in to - commodities to be forced cheaper.\n\nUnions were broken. This meant workers got less and less of a share of profits and were consistently required to give concessions as various states passed laws undercutting unions. Yes, I know they had problems, but they were the only think that kept employees at the bargaining table with power. \n\nGlobalization was enacted without any protections for local human workers. This means you were competing against literally slave labor in some markets. Information workers were somewhat insulated for a period of time, but turns out that too could be outsourced. This wasn't just a matter of using labor where the cost of living was lower, this also allowed regulatory arbitrage so companies could shop around for places without expensive worker protections and places where unions were forbidden. \n\nAutomation and machine learning continue to eat jobs. Basically the only way a human has a job is if it is cheaper than a computer/robot. Look at driving, fairly soon (not as soon as some think) the human will not be needed. Fast food establishments don't want a higher minimum wage and argue they'll just automate it. In other words, unless you are willing to be cheaper, work longer, and complain less than a computer you will be replaced. This drives down wages.\n\nMeanwhile real wealth is increasingly impossible for people to achieve. They will NEVER have enough money to play wall street, invest in startups, etc. Starting up a business is increasingly a losing strategy as the big guys get bigger and more all powerful. \n\nThere's some hope for people who exist at the fringes. Say, provide a luxury human experience at a premium price (craft beer, foodies, carefully made latte art, custom art, etc), but that won't be able to employ most people. \n\nIt's not a positive looking future if you rely on a salary/employment for income.

Edit: [Here' the Bureau of Labor Statistics data](https://www.bls.gov/lpc/prodybar.htm)\n\nBoomers had the advantage of the Post WW2 economy and new technologies really changing the game fast for almost every industry in the world economy. \n\nNow, though, those changes don't have that much of an impact on productivity. There just isn't the demand on the supply side to pay more for good talent. \n\nThe only way you, as a worker, can demand more money is if you have an extreme skill in wicked high demand. That usually means you're an engineer or a doctor. Hell, even engineer's can't make the sort of demands they used to be able to make (unless you engineer battery technology or AI).

You should be doing great with your high school education.\"* \n\nI said I've been working non-stop for 3 years in min wage service jobs, I have no kids and I can't even afford rent. I can't get a good job because I don't have a college degree or any technical training. Do you really think I'm the problem here? \n\nHe failed to mention that he had the Boys and Girls Club where he went every day after school and had a mentor that taught him woodworking and became a 2nd father to him. That gave him free technical training I would have to pay thousands for. That 2nd father / mentor then vouched for him right out of high school so he could get a job. That job out of school paid more (with inflation) than my three jobs. He also failed to mention that he bought the house from his uncle who sold it to him privately and let him pay it off without interest. He also failed to mention that he lived at home while saving for that house and his parents let him live their for free. As where I was paying them rent. \n\nI just wish boomers in general would take the time to look at how the world has changed. \n\n**Edit:** I've since went to and graduated from college. My post was past tense and college wasn't the instant destination for a high school kid back then. Factory work was a viable option as well back then.\n\n**Edit 2:** To the people replying to me about to say something negative like \"you should go to college or get training. This is your fault\" You're missing two key points. One: I must ask you. How are you failing to read that the entire post is written in past tense? So stop replying to me like I'm 21 still and living at home. It's clearly past tense.\n\nTwo is the entire point of my post is how my father graduated with only a high school degree and with a little bit of help got a great job. My point was that doesn't exist for my generation. What a high school drop out could do back in the day (sectary for example) you need an associates to do now.

During those days, even if you didn't have a degree you could be trained and at least be able to pull of a career that way. Things have changed now. The skills required to get an entry level position includes 2 years of experience out of college. \n\nFor instance, if anyone works in tech they know the insane amount of experience required just to get into a position. You graduated as a cs major well we need you to know all of the requirements that come with working with frameworks. Did you want to become a business analyst well you need 1-2 years worth of experience in tableau.\n\nThings have changed and that's why a lot of millennial who have jobs tend not to be loyal. The bar is set so high, that those who have an in have unlimited opportunities while everyone else basically scrapes by.\n\nEdit: am extremely happy that the people who have responded to this thread have been courteous and really made their case well. I have tried to respond to as many comments as I can just to have a good discussion/debate. Also there are a lot of jr/entry level in distress in this thread and to those I want to encourage you.

I poured 4 years of my life into a tech school (during which I had a chance to go to a competition that if I placed well in would have set me up for life but my spot got taken by a spoiled rich girl who's dad paid her way in. Said girl did alright and was offered multiple salaried job that literally would have set me up for life but her response was \"nah, I just did this for fun. I'm going to a different school next year for IT\") BUT ANYWAY I put everything I had into this school cause I knew that this was my only shot. My dad has a new family and cant help me with school and my mom dissapeared south with her boyfriend so college isn't an option right now. So I graduate at the top of my class with a personal letter of recommendation from my teacher for outstanding performance and I enter the \"real world\". It's been 3 and a half years since then and you know what I've been told by every single possible employer that I've contacted in the last 3 years, \"I'm sorry but we REQUIRE at least 2 years work experience, you should look into an internship though\". I now am working at a grocery store for 9 dollars an hour and have to decide every week whether I need my medication or food. I tried playing by the systems rules and you know what I found, it doesn't work. For a majority of us, it doesn't work. Just because it did for you doesn't mean it will for the rest of us. That girl is now spending a year abroad cause she decided IT was boring her and my hamster just died cause I didnt have the money to buy him food. Fuck your system.\n",

I just feel like it kind of sucks that these labor jobs aren't that hard actually to learn and so it's better for the company to just hire a new person and pay them way less then to actually have an employee that stays for life and builds a life from their pay from working and the time they put it.

    "body": "In the 1970s, women started entering the workforce in greater numbers and often at lower wages than men. That would undoubtedly trigger a twofold problem: more labor supply makes workers cheaper and female workers were offering their work for cheaper.\n\nNot blaming women, it just seems like that would have an enormous impact on the price of labor, especially unskilled labor. By the time labor participation started to drop in the early 2000s, many workers had already been displaced by outsourcing or automation (both of which would increase the GDP and reduce american labor, skewing the \"labor productivity\" stat to make it seem Americans had become more productive).\n\nFrom the Bureau of Labor Statistics: \"Labor productivity is a measure of economic performance that compares the amount of goods and services produced (output) with the number of hours worked to produce those goods and services.\"\n\nLP = GDP / Wage Hours. If you reduce wage hours (by replacing workers with outsourced jobs and automation), you're increasing labor productivity without increasing anyone's wages. No one suddenly became 72% more productive, equipment and capital were provided to make it so.",

Might take 1-2 years before they are proficient so the bottom line (i.e. Corporations only care about money now and not people) is all that matters.

And forget working for the same company for your whole professional life. Now instead of rewarding you for your loyalty and dedication to the company, they'll lay you off to hire somebody who has to do it for entry level pay. \n\n Technology has made things more efficient, so people are doing the work that it used to take 3-4 people to do. \n\nLook at Mad Men, for example. Think about all those secretaries and switch board operators, etc. Sure those weren't excellent jobs or whatever, but it's on TV right now. The four girls working the switch board? Once you set up your IP phone system, it's pretty much taken care of. \n\nEverybody having their own admin assistant? Yeah right. One person can answer calls for an entire building, and with what, six buttons transfer a call to where it's supposed to go? Email has more or less replaced the need for dedicated mail room workers. \n\nHell, I used to work for a \"pharmacy benefits manager\" (mail order pharmacy). They do automated prescription dispensing and then send it via UPS/USPS to your house. The building I was in filled 600,000 prescriptions a week. How many pharmacists would that take? And those jobs require what, 6 years of college, plus passing a licensing exam and maintaining your license with your state board of pharmacy.\n\nHell, I had a part time job at UPS once.

His dialogue of the slow (10-years+) unraveling of European society in the late 20's and 30's has many parallels to today.  \n\nShirer notes that in that time governments (the example he gave was the French government) became increasingly ineffective because of the extreme polarization between wings.  Right Wing thought the Left Wing were Communists only worthy of death, and the Left Wing thought the Right Wing were Fascists whom would quickly wipe out all opposition if given power.  The polarization made it so that there was never able to be a strong government that could last for even a year or two before collapsing and calling for new elections.  A side effect was that none of the \"great\" democracies were able to effectively counter aggression by the rising totalitarian powers of the time because no one could even agree on what a proper response *was*.\n\nNowadays you see Brexit / Remain, the US Election... increasingly likely polarizing votes in France and Italy, and polarized populations throughout the world's democracies that are vulnerable to outside influence (Russian influence in elections, if true).\n\nI'm not saying that history always repeats (though it often does rhyme), but it's extremely interesting to look at the parallels of the 30's (polarization, depression) with today (polarization, aftermath of the great recession) and to watch ourselves make many of the same decisions that were made 80 years ago.  I can only hope that this time it doesn't end in conflagration as it did then.\n\n\nEDIT:  I just thought of another parallel between that time and today.  In the 30's there was a paradigm shift in how people got their information.  People were able to follow the events of the day within minutes due to radio.  Today were are going through another information paradigm shift in people being able to access unfiltered information in real time through the internet and mobile devices/video.  I beleive we're still in a feeling out phase of this shift in information.\n\nEDIT2:  Obligatory thank you for popping my gold cherry kind stranger!\n\n",

    "body": "[Here's a link](http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,970634,00.html) to an excerpt of an article from Time magazine about GenXer's from July 16, 1990:\n\n>They have trouble making decisions. They would rather hike in the Himalayas than climb a corporate ladder. They have few heroes, no anthems, no style to call their own. They crave entertainment, but their attention span is as short as one zap of a TV dial. They hate yuppies, hippies and druggies. They postpone marriage because they dread divorce. They sneer at Range Rovers, Rolexes and red suspenders. What they hold dear are family life, local activism, national parks, penny loafers and mountain bikes. \n\nAnd here's the whole article that, I guess, was published online in 2001. \n\nhttp://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,155010,00.html\n\nInterestingly, this article was written before the term Gen X came to popularity so they just refer to us as \"the twentysomething generation.\"\n\n>What worries parents, teachers and employers is that the latest crop of adults wants to postpone growing up. At a time when they should be graduating, entering the work force and starting families of their own, the twentysomething crowd is balking at those rites of passage. A prime reason is their recognition that the American Dream is much tougher to achieve after years of housing-price inflation and stagnant wages. Householders under the age of 25 were the only group during the 1980s to suffer a drop in income, a decline of 10%. One result: fully 75% of young males 18 to 24 years old are still living at home, the largest proportion since the Great Depression.\n\nETA: Ha! I just spotted this in the article (which is pretty long, actually.) \n\n>Today's potential leaders seem unable to maintain their stature. They have a way of either self-destructing or being decimated in the press, which trumpets their faults and foibles. \"The media don't really give young people role models anymore,\" says Christina Chinn, 21, of Denver. **\"Now you get role models like Donald Trump and all of the moneymakers -- no one with real ideals.\"**\n\nWe had his number back then.\n",

The actual root cause is that community colleges (and state universities) have seen their public funding almost completely wiped out over the last 20-30 years. For example, at community colleges in Washington State (where I teach) state funds covered 90% of instructional costs in the 60s, 70s, and early 80s. By 2008, that had dropped to only 65% and by the end of the recession the state only funds 35% of our budget. \n\nSo what happens when state colleges aren't funded? They need to find ways to increase revenue. How do they do that? Lower entrance requirements to increase the student population and incremental increase in student costs. You will find some administrative/overhead bloat, but it is a symptom of the fact that public institutions are being forced to behave like for-profit entities to recruit and retain enough students to pay their bills and support their operations because the states are not funding them the way they were designed to be funded.\n\nHowever unfair this may be to students (passing along the costs), the only other option for community colleges is to cease to exist, which would create massive opportunity losses for the demographics that are most vulnerable in our communities. \n\nThe fact that you can still get associate's degrees, technical certifications, medical certifications, professional certifications, and some limited bachelor's degrees for tuition rates of only $4500/year at community colleges in Washington State (one of the more expensive states to live in in the US) despite that the institutions have lost over 50% of their public funding in the last three decades is a testament that the institutions really are trying to preserve their mission in the face of a lot of adversity.

    "body": "Baby boomers are easily the most entitled, spoiled, and selfish generation in American history. They had cheaper education, their minimum wage could be a livable wage, and many of them garnered significant wealth. \n\nBut, that wasn't enough. They wanted more. So, they cut taxes to historically low levels and gave themselves even more benefits (2006's Medicare Part D, for example) which have helped to explode the debt. They reaped all of the benefits of all the social programs that their parents left them while refusing to leave their kids (us) something as basic as universal healthcare that the rest of the civilized world enjoys. \n\nOh, but it gets better. They insist on cutting both social programs and education for the following generations because they refused to pay the appropriate amount of taxes to pay for all of their benefits. For all the debt they incurred through stupid wars, benefits for themselves, etc...we and the next couple of generations are likely going to pay for it with higher taxes across the board than they would've had to pay due to interest piling up. Sooner or later, debts will have to be paid back or at least more and more money will go towards the debt.  (By the way, without a suitable replacement, the estimated costs of repealing Obamacare are $350 billion and/or may accumulate to around $9 TRILLION over 10 years - \nHere's the budget resolution itself: http://www.budget.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/S.Con.Res.RepealResolution.pdf\n- Funny enough, the new Congress recently voted with language included to allow them to conceal the true costs from the public). \n\nThe thing about tax cuts: They aren't free and most of the tax cuts go to the already super wealthy who just stash it away without using it to better the economy. On top of significantly higher taxes, even more cuts to education and social programs will have to be made to make up for all of those years of lost revenue since they refuse to pay for what they spent.\n\nWe really need to reclaim the mantle of 'fiscal responsibility' (yeah, that mantra they like to beat over our heads as they fuck more shit up for us financially) from our parents.\n\nEdit: Words.\n\nEdit 2: All of this came out way more hostile than I intended.  Like many of you, I'm just beyond frustrated right now. I love my mom, really.\n\nEdit 3: Those of you who are butt-hurt by any of this don't seem to care about the voting patterns of the older generation. And, unlike many of my friends, I'm doing quite well financially, thanks.  I've been both lucky and educated enough to make good decisions. It's everyone who isn't that well off that I worry about...you should try it some time, but that requires empathy.\n\nEdit 4: Thanks for the gold.",

Even if you go to an in-state school (out-of-state is even harder) you have to go back home to vote a lot of the time. In my home state of PA if I went to Penn State I'd be 4 hours from home and we always vote during the week. For me to vote in an election I'd have to drive 8 hours in a day to vote, and I'd miss class. Early voting would certainly help with this, but I had never even heard of it until I went to college in Louisiana. It just really frustrates me that it can be so difficult to vote, and I know that this isn't a free pass for my age group to not vote, we absolutely need to be more proactive in utilizing our rights as citizens, but I also can't stand the 'millennials are so apathetic, they never vote' angle.",
