    "body": "Though it once represented American ideals and stood to promote freedom of communication, The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has strayed from its original mission and acts against both its own mission and the interests of the American people.\n\nFounded in in 1934, the FCC\u2019s mission was to \u201cmake available so far as possible, to all people of the United States\u2026 rapid, efficient, Nationwide, and world-wide wire and radio communication services *with adequate facilities at reasonable charges.*\u201d (Emphasis mine.)\n\nThis is a goal worthy of and necessary to any democracy - to ensure equal access to the best information and communication technologies available. Democracies live and die by the quality of accessible information and understanding of current issues: illiterate and ill-informed voters make illiterate and ill-informed decisions, often voting against public interests because they are ill-informed, allowing outside influences to slowly disintegrate the very freedoms inherent in a democracy. Ensuring fair access to accurate information is a critical part of ensuring the survival of a democracy.\n\nHowever, since the removal of several regulations in the 1980s to make it more \u201cmarket-oriented\u201d, the FCC has gradually, systematically, and dangerously veered away from its mission to ensure equal access to reliable information. It has deeply wounded American democracy in the process, and seeks to wound it mortally.\n\nThe FCC was originally bound by a number of regulations - among them, The Fairness Doctrine of 1949. The Fairness Doctrine required television broadcasters, radio stations, and cable providers to both inform the public about important issues, and to do so in an honest, equitable, and balanced way - to expose viewers to opposing viewpoints in a reasonable and truthful manner. The FCC\u2019s enforcement of the Fairness Doctrine is responsible for Americans\u2019 trust of broadcast and television news. Legally obligating broadcasting license holders to both present critical issues to Americans and to do so in a way that accurately reflected reality ensured that citizens could reasonably expect that they were getting an accurate representation of a given issue when they watched the news. Consumers had no need to seek multiple sources, since those multiple sources would essentially be hitting the same notes on the same issues. Consumers could trust that broadcast networks were accurate, reliable, honest sources of information.\n\nThe Doctrine\u2019s removal, and the FCC\u2019s subsequent lack of responsibility to uphold broadcast standards, has destroyed the quality broadcasts that built trust in those institutions.\n\nWhen the Fairness Doctrine was effectively eliminated in 1987, and officially eliminated from law in 2011, the FCC was no longer obligated to issue fines to broadcast networks who intentionally represented facts in untruthful or misleading ways. When the Doctrine was eliminated, the FCC was no longer expected to uphold the high standard of communication that had built the American public\u2019s confidence and trust in broadcast networks. \n\nThe FCC\u2019s failure to enforce communication standards since the 1980s has allowed market pressures to contaminate the quality of news broadcasts. Moreover, broadcast networks became incentivized to ensure that they had the largest audience possible, by any means necessary. As a result, broadcast news networks have become more partisan, more extreme, more reactionary, and focus on their own agendas rather than public interest. This is demonstrated by the razor-sharp partisan divides exhibited by viewership at each of the major broadcast news stations, and the fervor with which those news stations present issues in ways that support their own avaricious agendas rather than the best interests of the American people.\n\nThe FCC ceased to regulate broadcast media against market pressures, and in return, broadcast news has been corrupted by those market pressures.\n\nWithout FCC enforcement of the Fairness Doctrine, TV news networks are now allowed to present current events with whatever partisan or corporate slant they deem most self-serving. They are allowed to misrepresent fact using both misleading \u201cexperts\u201d on two sides of uncontroversial issues, and one-sided presentations of controversial issues. They are allowed to not report on momentous news regarding American democracy, and instead discuss sensationalist accounts of news for the sole purpose of securing larger crowds of viewers. They are allowed to lie to their viewers in all but letter, and all in the name of profit for the companies that own them.\n\nThe FCC stood passively by and allowed broadcast networks to be corrupted by greed.\n\nBut now, the FCC is ACTIVELY ENCOURAGING corporate interests to corrupt the internet.\n\nIn December 2017, the Chairman of the FCC will hold a vote to overturn the principle of net neutrality. Net neutrality requires that all information be treated equally by internet service providers. In other words, net neutrality prevents ISPs from charging different amounts of money based on the websites a customer visits, the same way that an electric company can\u2019t charge a different rate for the electricity to power a microwave than they charge to power a light bulb.\n\nNet neutrality prevents ISPs from charging extra fees to visit certain websites. It prevents ISPs from slowing a customer\u2019s internet connection because the customer is using the services of the ISP\u2019s competitor. Net neutrality prevents ISPs from charging content providers (such as YouTube, Netflix, The New York Times, and IGN) exorbitant fees to ensure that their content is viewable in the \u201cfast lane\u201d. It prevents ISPs from blocking websites based on the consumer\u2019s ability to pay.\n\nWithout net neutrality, ISPs could charge fees for any imaginable reason.\n\nSince net neutrality is the existing paradigm, it may be difficult to imagine a world where fees are ubiquitous to internet use. Under net neutrality, you pay your monthly subscription fee for internet service. You connect to the internet, and can access anything you find without the ISP charging additional fees based on what you access.\n\nWithout net neutrality, ISPs could charge an extra fee unless you used their brand of modem. They could charge more to access certain websites, or offer subscriptions to the services that they own, so that you don\u2019t have to pay additional fees whenever you wanted to access their service. They could squash their competition by forcing content providers to pay exorbitant fees to be offered to the ISP\u2019s customers, preventing the growth of non-ISP businesses into the ISP\u2019s markets. ISPs could write clauses into their service contracts that terminate your service if you visit certain websites, charging exorbitant fees to reinstate your service.\n\nWithout net neutrality, there is no oversight for what ISPs can and can\u2019t charge for. \n\nThe FCC is not only standing aside to let net neutrality be dissolved, but are actively encouraging its dissolution.\n\nIn December, the FCC will hold a vote to to take away our equal access to information, and give that power to the ISPs themselves. If the FCC gives ISPs control over what they provide and what they don\u2019t, they will lay the foundation for an America where ISPs control all access to information - holding it hostage until consumers pay whatever price they assign.\n\nIf that\u2019s a world where you want to live, sit by and do nothing. The FCC will happily assure you that they have your best interests at heart - as they allow ISPs to line their pockets by selling you your freedom.\n\nBut if you believe that ISPs have no business increasing their profit margins by taking away your freedoms, call your Senators and Congressmen. Remind them that American democracy relies on fair access to information - and without equal access to the internet, there can be no fair access to information.\n\nRemind your legislators the FCC is voting to let ISPs ransom freedoms from the people your legislators were elected to serve and represent.\n\nRemind your legislators that the FCC exists to protect Americans\u2019 access to information - not to sell it to the highest bidder.\n\nRemind your legislators to prevent the FCC from overturning net neutrality now - because you might not be able to tell them afterwards.\n\nMore info:\nThe Fairness Doctrine - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairness_Doctrine\n\nThe FCC's History and Mission - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Communications_Commission#Mission_and_strategy\n\nThe Best-Case Scenario If Net Neutrality Is Overturned - Portugal - http://www.businessinsider.com/net-neutrality-portugal-how-american-internet-could-look-fcc-2017-11\n\nWhat Happens When Net Neutrality Is Overturned - The Loss of Business and Consumer Protections, and Reliance on ISPs to Be Trustworthy - https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/what-happens-once-net-neutrality-rules-bite-the-dust/2017/11/22/d8a50bf2-cfe8-11e7-a87b-47f14b73162a_story.html?utm_term=.552e10266101\n\nReach out to your legislators:\nhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/contact\nhttp://gofccyourself.com\nhttps://www.senate.gov/general/contact_information/senators_cfm.cfm\nhttps://www.house.gov/representatives\n\nTwitter:\n@realDonaldTrump\n@AjitPaiFCC\n@MClyburnFCC\n@mikeofcc",

Period. End of story. ISPs are notoriously shady, but here are some reassurances Trump's FCC has given us**:\n\n**FTC Privacy Regulation, sec.177 aka Facebook, Reddit, etc. can't snoop on your privacy:**\n\n>Restoring FTC [Federal Trade Commission] jurisdiction over ISPs will enable the FTC to apply its extensive privacy and data security expertise to provide the uniform online privacy protections that consumers expect and deserve.651\n\n**Direct quote from Trump's FCC:  No throttling. FCC release, p.83**\n\n>Many of the largest ISPs (Comcast, AT&T, Verizon, Cox, Frontier, etc.) have committed in this proceeding not to block or throttle legal content.507 These commitments can be enforced by the FTC under Section 5, protecting consumers without imposing public-utility regulation on ISPs.508\n\n**b-but im an ISP I don't wanna be transparent I just wanna bait-and-switch my customers (FCC release p.82):**\n\n>The FTC\u2019s unfair-and-deceptive-practices authority \u201cprohibits companies from selling consumers one product or service but providing them something different,\u201d which makes voluntary commitments enforceable.502 The FTC also requires the \u201cdisclos[ur]e [of] material information if not disclosing it would mislead the consumer,\u201d so if an ISP \u201cfailed to disclose blocking, throttling, or other practices that would matter to a reasonable consumer, the FTC\u2019s deception authority would apply.\u201d503\n\n**Specifically good for new media ISPs cannot conspire. (FCC invokes Sherman Act Antitrust Laws, Section 144, p.85, FCC release)**\n\n>Section 1 of the Sherman Act bars contracts, combinations, or conspiracies in restraint of trade, making anticompetitive arrangements illegal. If ISPs reached agreements to unfairly block, throttle, or discriminate against Internet conduct or applications, these agreements would be per seillegal under the antitrust laws.518\n\n**UNLIMITED NETFLIX, and other video sources (Yes this includes porn) **\n\n>If an ISP that also sells video services degrades the speed or quality of competing \u201cOver the Top\u201d video services (such as Netflix),526 that conduct could be challenged as anticompetitive foreclosure.\n\n**Here's the big one.  Free Press was pushing hard to mess up the network's ability to regulate and wanted to censor it hard.  This won't happen under Trump's FCC (THANK GOD)**\n\n>We also conclude that the Commission should have been cautioned against reclassifying broadband Internet access service as a telecommunications service in 2015 because doing so involved \u201claying claim to extravagant statutory power over the national economy ...\"\n\n**And this is the big one.  Unlike Obama's net neutrality this new system would not only allow competitors to self regulate but if they *DO* misbehave the FTC would destroy them.**\n\n>176.We also reject AT&T\u2019s assertion that the Commission should conditionally forbear from all Title II regulations as a preventive measure to address the contingency that a future Commission might seek to reinstate the Title II Order.647 Although AT&T explains that \u201cconditional forbearance would provide an extra level of insurance against the contingency that a future, politically motivated Commission might try to reinstate a \u2018common carrier\u2019 classification [2015 Net Neutrality Regulations],\u201d648 we see no need to address the complicated question of prophylactic forbearance and find such extraordinary measures [are] unnecessary.\n\nTLDR\n\n*    Regulatory rollback throwback to 90's.\n\n*    FCC claims the 2015 Regulations gave the government \"extravagant statutory power over the national economy\". \n\n*    Regulatory oversight of the ISP industry shifts back to FTC (Federal Trade Commission) as it has been since the invention of the internet.\n\n*    FCC is enforcing against throttling, censorship, restriction, etc. by invoking consumer protection and anti-trust laws (via FTC).\n\n*    If ISPs collectively conspire to paywall a content-provider, they are subject to FTC anti-trust penetration.\n\n*    FCC has reduced its own jurisdiction, because they're typically geared toward stricter and narrower regulations (censoring profanity on the radio, cable, etc.) as opposed to regulating the entire internet service-provider industry.\n\n*    FCC repeatedly acknowledges that its new policy is deliberately business-friendly in hopes to expand the economy (internet plays a huge role obviously). Acknowledges that potential abuse of this friendliness will result in stricter policy.\n\n*    America has some of the shittiest internet in the world because our infrastructure is antiquated and fiber-optic trenching projects keep getting killed. Hopefully this provides the investment needed to fix that. Better infrastructure means faster speeds and cheaper service.\n\n*    [THIS IS A BIG ONE]  Remember all the Congressmen who wanted to sell out our personal information earlier this year? Allegedly this FCC repeal will block that, because of FTC consumer privacy protection regulations don't allow it.  Trump's admin is trying to fight for your privacy.",

Bob Mercer has certainly embraced the view that radiation could be good for human health - low level radiation.\n\n>Among other things, Mercer said the United States went in the wrong direction after the 1964 Civil Rights Act, and also insisted the only remaining racists in the United States were African-Americans\n\nhttp://www.npr.org/2017/05/26/530181660/robert-mercer-is-a-force-to-be-reckoned-with-in-finance-and-conservative-politic\n\nSteve Bannon on getting \"rootless white males\" \"radicalized\":\n\n>the power of what he called \u201crootless white males\u201d who spend all their time online.\n\n>And five years later when Bannon wound up at Breitbart, he resolved to try and attract those people over to Breitbart because he thought they could be radicalized in a kind of populist, nationalist way. And the way that Bannon did that, the bridge between the angry abusive gamers and Breitbart and Pepe was Milo Yiannopoulous, who Bannon discovered and hired to be Breitbart\u2019s tech editor.\n\nhttp://www.businessinsider.com/steve-bannon-white-gamers-seinfeld-joshua-green-donald-trump-devils-bargain-sarah-palin-world-warcraft-gamergate-2017-7\n\n>\"I realized Milo could connect with these kids right away,\" Bannon told Green. \"You can activate that army.

It reads: \u201cPeople are lazy. With television you just sit\u2014watch\u2014listen.

Bush in 1988, and waged a secret campaign on behalf of Big Tobacco to derail health care reform in 1993.\n\n>\"He was the premier guy in the business,\" says former Reagan campaign manager Ed Rollins. \"He was our Michelangelo.\"\n\n>Over the next decade, drawing on the tactics he honed working for Nixon, he helped elect two more conservative presidents, Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush. At the time, Reagan was beginning to exhibit what his son Ron now describes as early signs of Alzheimer\u2019s, and his age and acuity were becoming a central issue in the campaign.\n\n>But in 1993 Ailes inked a secret deal with tobacco giants Philip Morris and RJ Reynolds to go full-force after the Clinton administration on its central policy objective: health care reform.\n\n>Hillarycare was to have been funded, in part, by a $1-a-pack tax on cigarettes. To block the proposal, Big Tobacco paid Ailes to produce ads highlighting \u201creal people affected by taxes.\u201d\n\n>According to internal memos, Ailes also explored how Philip Morris could create a phony front group called the \u201cCoalition for Fair Funding of Health Care\u201d to deploy the same kind of \u201cindependent\u201d ads that produced Willie Horton. In a precursor to the modern Tea Party, Ailes conspired with the tobacco companies to unleash angry phone calls on Congress \u2013 cold-calling smokers and patching them through to the switchboards on Capitol Hill \u2013 and to gin up the appearance of a grassroots uprising, busing 17,000 tobacco employees to the White House for a mass demonstration. \u201cRJR has trained 200 people to call in to shows,\u201d a March 1993 memo revealed. \u201cA packet has gone to Limbaugh.

Only a few days before Trump\u2019s Inauguration and The Review\u2019s anniversary event, Thiel attended the pro-Trump and heavily alt-right-attended \u201cDeploraball,\u201d which had been in part organized by Jeff Giesea \u201997, a former Review editor-in-chief who once worked at Thiel Capital Management.\n\n>In Oct. 2016, shortly after Thiel donated $1.25 million to Trump, Thiel publicly apologized for passages in his 1995 book The Diversity Myth, such as claiming that some alleged date rapes were \u201cseductions that are later regretted,\u201d ... But three months later, during the after party of the 30-year anniversary event at Thiel\u2019s home, according to a former editor, Thiel stated that his apology was just for the media, and that \u201csometimes you have to tell them what they want to hear.\u201d\n\nhttps://stanfordpolitics.org/2017/11/27/peter-thiel-cover-story/\n\nAnother area where Republican voters get so easily played by billionaires using \"God, guns, gays\" and racism to get less regulation and avoid paying their taxes:\n\n>Exhibit 13: 10% fewer Republicans believed the wealthy weren't paying enough in taxes once a billionaire became their president. Democrats remain fairly consistent. http://www.people-press.org/2017/04/14/top-frustrations-with-tax-system-sense-that-corporations-wealthy-dont-pay-fair-share/\n\nhttps://np.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/787fdh/after_gold_star_widow_breaks_silence_trump/dornc4n/",

But I do have some questions regarding those reassurances:\n\n* What necessity exists for an ISP being able to block lawful traffic in a way that is not anti-competitive?\n\n* What happens when ISPs are behaving in a way that are intrinsically difficult to prove as being anti-competitive? For example, when they throttle VOIP traffic to a degraded but not strictly unusable level, which affects only their competitors, but  they make a thin case that they're doing so for the health of their network as a whole, what recourse is there?\n\n* What stops an ISP from offlining a server that hosts content that is critical of their business practices? ISPs are under no obligation to uphold the free press on their private networks, and such a move can't necessarily be construed as anti-competitive.\n\n* What stops ISPs from prioritizing the traffic of paying content subscribers above the traffic of content subscribers who haven't paid?\n\n* What is the wisdom of a \"regulatory rollback throwback to 90s\" when prior to 2015's Open Internet Order we were regulating broadband carriers under **2010** rules? Why is winding the clock back an additional 20 years wise, when our understanding of the internet and our understanding of the behavior of ISPs has evolved so much since then?\n\nAnd when you say:\n\n> Everyone here agrees that ISPs should not throttle/paywall/censor/restrict our content. Period. End of story.\n\n* If we all agree the behavior is not acceptable, why do you feel the investigative arm of the FTC is equipped to handle abuse in a timely manner as opposed to simply banning the behavior? Isn't funding and growing an department of the government to meet this new demand actually soliciting *more* hands on government control?\n\n* What is the wisdom in allowing them to throttle/paywall/censor/restrict our content, when the recourse becomes *potentially* sanctioning them after the fact? Why should we allow the merits of the issue to be discussed in closed court rooms by well funded teams of ISP lawyers years after the abuse is committed?\n\n* It's not widely reported, but American internet actually entered the top 10 in terms of average broadband speeds in Q1 2017, due in large part to ongoing devotion to our nation's infrastructure - this ongoing devotion which, for all intents and purposes, wasn't affected by the NN ruling, as we experienced a 22% YoY growth compared to Q1 2016. This period, as you know, was entirely during our existing NN regulations. I'm not sure I follow the that repealing NN will have an appreciable affect on infrastructure improvement. Could you help me understand this line of reasoning?\n\n* On \"the big one\" - Do you have a source for FTC's consumer privacy protection regulations that bring you such relief, so that we may read what that entails? As far as I'd understood, the FTC's privacy regulations basically involve making sure companies keep their promises - if they notify us that they're going to sell our information in their service contracts, what in the FTC regulations stops them?\n\nThank you for reading, I hope to better understand your point of view on this subject.",

Unfortunately, some of the most critical parts of the FCC regulations either were not being enforced or hadn't had enough time to take effect so we don't have a very good opportunity compare the two.\n\n>America has some of the shittiest internet in the world because our infrastructure is antiquated and fiber-optic trenching projects keep getting killed. Hopefully this provides the investment needed to fix that. Better infrastructure means faster speeds and cheaper service.\n\nHow is removing ISP's from Title II going to provide the investment needed to trench out new fiber projects?",

Then comcast refunds a portion or some other sneaky method.  \n\nThey may even pay for exclusive rights.  This is not necessarily fast lane but similar.  Imagine if walmart paid comcast a few billion for exclusive online retail rights!  Since comcast can block traffic now at will.  This would mean the only online store that you can use is walmart.comcast.  Amazon would be blocked.  This walmart will feel a need to worry about amazons lower prices then?  \n\nAnd before you say \"time to get a vpn\" please tell me what you think it is do for you?  They might even straight up block vpns.  A vpn might allow you to access amazon in this scenario but it will not make your youtube go any faster.  Again, they will quickly start blocking vpns.

Companies like Comcast have existing utility easement rights/agreements with entire cities, so they don't have to do any new work on this end. New ISP's have to get rights from the city to run lines around it, then from developers, subdivisions, HOA's, and even individual property owners to get them into the neighborhoods.",

Obviously,the larger company would have it in their interest to ensure their stuff gets top priority.

Someone might cry that the regulations prevent normal business operation- and on a \"traditional\" scale that would be true,interference would be unfair. But on these scales,the playing field is so warped it could hardly be considered the same thing. It's not bad to want to be successful and beat opponents,but it is bad when the current rules enable it, don't really provide opportunity for any real competition,and are ultimately at the expense of the general population(the economy being \"good\" based solely on the metric of money flow doesn't necessarily mean indeviduals are better off,though it helps as sometimes the investments might be marginaly favorable,as apposed to nobody being able to provide.

    "body": "tldr: The FCC is about to kill net neutrality. We\u2019re protesting nationwide on Dec 7th to stop them. Head over to http://www.verizonprotests.com/ for more info.\n\nAlso there is a March on DC at https://www.reddit.com/r/marchfornetneutrality\n\nWHAT\u2019S HAPPENING? The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) just announced its plan to slash net neutrality rules, allowing ISPs like Verizon to block apps, slow websites, and charge fees to control what you see & do online. They vote December 14th. People from across the political spectrum are outraged, so we\u2019re planning to protest at Verizon retail stores across the country on December 7, one week before the vote and at the peak of the busy Holiday shopping season. We'll demand that our members of Congress take action to stop Verizon's puppet FCC from killing net neutrality.\n\nWHAT\u2019S NET NEUTRALITY? Net neutrality is the basic principle that has made the Internet into what it is today. It prevents big Internet Service Providers (like Verizon) from charging extra fees, engaging in censorship, or controlling what we see and do on the web by throttling websites, apps, and online services.\n\nWHY VERIZON STORES? The new chairman of the FCC, Ajit Pai, is a former top lawyer for Verizon, and the company has been spending millions on lobbying and lawsuits to kill net neutrality so they can gauge us all for more money. By protesting at Verizon stores, we\u2019re shining light on the corruption and demanding that our local do something about it. Only Congress has the power to stop Verizon's puppet FCC, so at the protests we'll be calling and tweeting at legislators, and in cities where it's possible we'll march from Verizon stores to lawmakers offices.\n\nWHAT ARE OUR DEMANDS? Ajit Pai is clearly still working for Verizon, not the public. But he still has to answer to Congress. So we\u2019re calling on our lawmakers to do their job overseeing the FCC and speak out against Ajit Pai\u2019s plan to gut Title II net neutrality protections and give Verizon and other giant ISPs everything on their holiday wishlist. \n\nHOW CAN I JOIN? Click here http://www.verizonprotests.com/ and you\u2019ll find an interactive map where you can see if there is already a protest planned near you. If not, you can sign up to host one, and we\u2019ll send you materials to make it easy and help you recruit others in your area. These protests will be quick, fun, and 100% legal. If you can\u2019t attend a protest on December 7th, you can still help defend net neutrality by calling your lawmakers and spreading the word on social media. You can also sign up to host a meeting with your members of Congress, or volunteer for our texting team to help turn people out for these protests.\n\n",

Big corporations like Comcast and AT&T have established their monopolies simply by getting in the pockets of lawmakers to block other ISPs from taking hold or even really starting up at all. I know Google Fiber had a hell of a time in my area simply because they were getting blocked in local government via permits and other things.\n\nSome people would say that the free market thing to do would be to stay out of the companies' way so they self-regulate, but the internet is an interesting resource. Comcast and AT&T don't own the internet, therefore letting them control access to that resource doesn't make sense. It's like if there was only one river in a 100 mile radius and having a company that doesn't own the land containing the river put up a fence on it and charge toll to go through to go get your water.\n\nAdditionally, allowing an ISP to charge for specific packages is actually anti-free market simply because the internet is a place where you can address new markets or challenge existing ones (see Uber/Lyft vs taxi or Airbnb vs Hotel or any other webpage designed to make money). If ISPs limit access to the internet based on specific packages, you'll see the big corporations get bigger and a lack of market competitors who can't break through that wall.\n\nUnderstand that there are a lot of variations on Libertarianism that have a lot of opinions on what actually fulfills Libertarian ideals, and these are the sorts of discussions where gray areas form. I'm a libertarian and I'm in favor of Net Neutrality because I think it's important for a free market, even if it is accomplished by limiting an existing market in a different way. ",
