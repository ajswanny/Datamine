See bottom for list.**\n\nI am far from a Manson apologist, but the guy was pretty doomed for a life of crime, mayhem and violence since birth.\n\nI suggest listening to the series about him on Last Podcast On The Left. It really paints a three dimensional portrait of the guy. He was born to a 16 year old sex worker, spent his childhood in a brothel. After that, he was sent to live with an his abusive religious aunt and her sadistic uncle and was systematically abused. He was berated for being a \"sissy\" and forced to wear girls clothes to his first day of school. \n\nAfter being passed back to his mother, she was terribly neglectful, famously selling the young boy for a pitcher of beer. He had a lonely childhood and was surrounded by crime, so naturally he began to partake in criminal activity himself, landing him in a reform school at the age of nine. He spent the next few years in and out of these types of schools, homes, and often prisions, and they were NOT healthy environments.\n\nIt was at these reform schools where he was raped and beat by the fellow children while the adults in charge turned a blind eye and often encouraged it. \n\nWhen he tried to reconnect with his mother, she wanted nothing to do with him. Naturally, he started committing more serious crime such as rape, pimping, theft and fraud. This led him to spending most of his life in prison, effectively missing the free love hippie movement, and i'd speculate he was completely shocked when he was released from prison in '67 to see that the world was so much different than the 50's. \n\nManson was sick, and those poor people would not have been murdered if it wasn't for him. He was an insane dude who somehow had a following of loyalists who were taking way too many drugs, listening a little too intently to the White Album, and were way too susceptible to the toxic environment that Manson and others had created on that ranch out in the desert. \n\nManson's life was fascinating and tragic. He didn't stand a chance of being a normal person given the way he grew up, he could have tried to clean up his act, but his criminal tendencies seemed to ingrained into him as a person, so he doubled down on the evilness inside him. \n\nThings people don't usually know about Manson.\n\n- He was a short dude. 5'0'' if I am not mistaken.\n\n- He was a decent songwriter. He wrote a tune for the Beach Boys and was a \"friend\" of Dennis Wilson. [Here is one of my favorite Manson tunes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpx4ODP35VQ). \n\n- He was married at some point and [looked like a normal dude](https://brenfrie.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/manson28n-2-web.jpg). \n\n- His main objective out in the desert with his cult was to manufacture dune buggies and sell them.\n\nI wonder what could have been done to stop this man from co-opting the hippie commune movement and turning it into a dangerous cult. What do we do with people like Manson? I hope we have ways of helping children who are born into dangerous and criminal lives now. \n\nI don't mourn the loss of Manson. I mourn the loss of the person he could have been under different circumstances. I admire his music. He was a talented songwriter. He had a way with words. Look them up, they are quite good.\n\nWhat a wasted life. What a tragedy his darkness had a hand in the gruesome deaths of innocent people. \n\nRest in peace Sharon Tate and her unborn baby.\n\nRest in peace Abigail Folger. \n\nRest in peace Leno and Rosemary LaBianca. \n\nRest in peace Wojciech Frykowski.\n\nRest in peace Steven Parent.\n\nRest in peace Donald Shea.\n\nRest in peace Gary Hinman.\n\nMake no mistake, Manson was a monster, but it was the way we used to treat (and possibly continue to treat) the disenfranchised people on the fringes of society that had a major part in creating that monster.\n\nThe crazy motherfucker said it best:\n\n\"My father is the jailhouse. My father is your system... I am only what you made me. I am only a reflection of you\".\n\n\nI've been guided twice for this post, and I am grateful that what I wrote resonated with people,  but it would mean a great deal more if we could donate to some relevant organizations in lieu of reddit gold.\n\nSome relevant organizations to consider supporting:\n\nInternational Cultic Studies Association - A group that helps former cult members, helps family of ex-cult members, educates the public on the dangers of cults, and helps support professionals who are studying how cults operate in hopes of stopping them. [Donate here](https://donatenow.networkforgood.org/icsa) or use[ this Amazon link](https://smile.amazon.com/ch/04-2667828) to put a small amount of your order toward this organization.\n\n[Sex Workers Outreach Project-USA](http://www.new.swopusa.org/donations-2/) - Sex Workers Outreach Project-USA is a national grassroots social justice network dedicated to the fundamental human rights of sex workers and their communities, focusing on ending violence and stigma through education, community building, and advocacy. Manson preyed on vulnerable sex workers as a pimp, he was violent towards women as a result and manipulated and abused his cult followers using the same tactics he learned being a pimp.\n\nThe Brain & Behavior Research Foundation is committed to alleviating the suffering caused by mental illness by awarding grants that will lead to advances and breakthroughs in scientific research.\n\nPerhaps my favorite one: [FLY](http://flyprogram.org/donate/). FLY\u2019s mission is to prevent juvenile crime and incarceration through legal education, leadership training, and one-on-one mentoring. At FLY we believe ALL our children deserve a chance to become more than their past mistakes. \n\nManson and his follows did a number on the public perception of mostly benign drugs such as psychedelics and marijuana. MAPS is an organization that is working to legitimize the use of these medications. [Donate to help those who can benefit from these substances and NOT end up with a swastika carved in their forehead.](https://store.maps.org/np/clients/maps/donation.jsp?campaign=93)",

    "body": "While I agree with much of what you've said (particularly the part about him being a decent songwriter), I'm a Manson 'scholar,' and most of what you've written about his early childhood is wrong. Manson lied often about his early years, and what he said was taken as fact by many who've written about him without conducting independent research.\n\nIt's not been corroborated that his mother was a prostitute. That claim came straight from Charlie and no one else. She *was* young and unready/unwilling to be a mother to him, though. It's true that she shoplifted and committed robberies; she was likely influenced by her older brother, who was a petty criminal. Her arrest records reflect this, and she did have to serve time. (She did not sell him for a pitcher of beer; that's another of Charlie's fantasies.) So his grandmother, a devout Christian but by all accounts loving toward Charlie, raised him during his early years. He attended church with her. His cousin, a few years older and, I believe, still alive, remembers him as a boy. He was always incorrigible; something was just \"off.\" He lied often, from a very young age, and had a temper. His grandmother was so soft-spoken that she couldn't handle him when he did begin to get into trouble at a young age.\n\nHe temporarily appeared to have \"reformed\" as a young man and got married in his grandmother's church. There's a record of this and at least one photo. By the time he landed himself in prison again, his mother was out, had remarried, and had adopted a daughter with her new husband. Apparently, her reform was successful, according to her daughter. Manson's adopted half-sister remembers their mother taking her to Terminal Island to visit Charlie so she could meet him. According to her, the mother had successfully reformed and was a good mother to her. She remembers her crying in front of the TV upon discovering that Charlie was responsible for the Tate-LaBianca murders and expressing her pain and sympathy for their deaths.\n\nCharlie did have a rough life...but not exactly for the reasons you've listed from his early childhood. Of course, his mother's crimes likely affected him, but he wasn't neglected nor unloved. He seems to have been destined--a victim of his own personality--to have a troubled existence. ",

What a tremendous amount of pain that person must have been carrying.  Initially, it was not his choice to be subjected to that pain.

Then you've got people like Bonnie and Clyde who tack on some bizarre love story.  \n\nI'd say there are about 10 people tied for \"most famous\" - and this creep was definitely in that group.",

San Francisco in the middle sixties was a very special time and place to be a part of. Maybe it meant something. Maybe not, in the long run . . . but no explanation, no mix of words or music or memories can touch that sense of knowing that you were there and alive in that corner of time and the world. Whatever it meant. . . .\n\nHistory is hard to know, because of all the hired bullshit, but even without being sure of \u201chistory\u201d it seems entirely reasonable to think that every now and then the energy of a whole generation comes to a head in a long fine flash, for reasons that nobody really understands at the time\u2014and which never explain, in retrospect, what actually happened.\n\nMy central memory of that time seems to hang on one or five or maybe forty nights\u2014or very early mornings\u2014when I left the Fillmore half-crazy and, instead of going home, aimed the big 650 Lightning across the Bay Bridge at a hundred miles an hour wearing L. L. Bean shorts and a Butte sheepherder's jacket . . . booming through the Treasure Island tunnel at the lights of Oakland and Berkeley and Richmond, not quite sure which turn-off to take when I got to the other end (always stalling at the toll-gate, too twisted to find neutral while I fumbled for change) . . . but being absolutely certain that no matter which way I went I would come to a place where people were just as high and wild as I was: No doubt at all about that. . . .\n\nThere was madness in any direction, at any hour. If not across the Bay, then up the Golden Gate or down 101 to Los Altos or La Honda. . . . You could strike sparks anywhere. There was a fantastic universal sense that whatever we were doing was right, that we were winning. . . .\n\nAnd that, I think, was the handle\u2014that sense of inevitable victory over the forces of Old and Evil. Not in any mean or military sense; we didn\u2019t need that. Our energy would simply prevail. There was no point in fighting\u2014on our side or theirs. We had all the momentum; we were riding the crest of a high and beautiful wave. . . .\n\nSo now, less than five years later, you can go up on a steep hill in Las Vegas and look West, and with the right kind of eyes you can almost see the high-water mark\u2014that place where the wave finally broke and rolled back.\u201d\n\nThis was published in 71, meaning it was probably written in 68-69.",

Dee tries to recruit Mac and Charlie to help get Phoebe #1 to bang Frank, but they're too busy hanging out with Joey and talking about movies they want to film. Joey, however, is totally into the idea that Phoebe needs to get laid, and they decide to film a fake movie where Frank and Phoebe are the leads in order to spark an attraction. Frank thinks it's a porno and treats it like one.\n\nDennis would absolutely try to bang Rachel. Monica would get crazy jealous, but Dennis quite obviously doesn't want her. Dennis also hates that he's not the lead in Mac, Charlie, and Joey's fake movie, and wants to not only be the lead, but have Rachel be the love interest of the lead (instead of Phoebe, because it reminds him of his sister, and he's already referred to Phoebe as \"Bird #2\") because it might spark romance. He takes it way too seriously, and pulls some really cringe-y \"reading lines louder and with more emotion\" moments, in full costume, with makeup.\n\nChandler is the floater. He sees the each instance, buys in for maybe a minute or two, sees the insanity, and walks away from it. He is also incredibly annoyed that Monica's so concerned with Rachel getting attention while she isn't, even though she's married. He slowly puts everything together, and very sarcastically eggs on the frictions between them \"oh, you know what Joey, why don't you make Charlie the lead? I bet he'd be better than Frank, because you'd actually be able to fit him in the shot.\" *laugh track*, pan to Frank, visibly upset (maybe he locks eyes with Chandler, and there's an exchange of \"i know you know that i know\" with eyebrow raising, eye squinting, and head tilting)\n\nPhoebe also inexplicably wants Charlie, and confides this in Mac. Mac is grossed out and makes a joke about it to Rachel, who also inexplicably wants Charlie.\n\nhilarity ensues.",
