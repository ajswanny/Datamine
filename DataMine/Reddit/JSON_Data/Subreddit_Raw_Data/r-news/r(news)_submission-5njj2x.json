    "body": "Clarification here, CVS cut the retail price of the existing generic for Adrenaclick (known as Epinephrine).\n\nThis generic has been around for a while, but isn't an A/B rated generic so it's illegal for a pharmacy to dispense this if a prescription is written for EpiPen. We can dispense this if a prescription is written for Adrenaclick or Epinephrine.\n\n**Make sure your doctor writes a script for Adrenaclick or it is illegal for us to dispense this cheaper generic to you**\n\nEdit: The injection device of each product is what limits the A/B rating. Adrenaclick and EpiPen have different autoinjector systems. Yes the regulations are that strict. [Here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRgqwgCh4Fs) a video showing the difference between Adrenaclick, Epipen, and AuviQ (which has been recalled and discontinued).",

I'm alergic to nuts and one time i didn't have an epipen so my grandpa went to the fridge cut off the adrenal glands from the kidney of I think a pig. Anyway he cut it in half and told me to put it under my Lip Like tobacco and my airways opened up about 1 minute later. He drove me to the hospital I got steroid injections to treat the reaction, but the docter was dumbfounded on what my grandpa did. Turns when my grandpa first became a rancher pharmaceutical company's were still using animal organs to make hormones. He use to sell organs to these company's that's how he new what to do. So what I don't get is why this shit is so expensive yet I can get epi and nore epi from a fucking pig kidney. ",

    "body": "Another Edit: First thank you to whoever gave me gold! \n\nSecond, /u/Jahodac is right with pretty much everything he said here (https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/5njj2x/cvs_puts_out_generic_competitor_to_epipen_at_a/dcclw19/). Thank you for bringing all that up. \n\nThere is a manufacturer discount from Mylan as I mention below that can save up to $300 (https://www.activatethecard.com). It doesn't work if you don't have insurance and personally for me, it only took $100 off but perhaps it was going towards my huge ass deductible. Some redditors have said that as the EpiPen generic is not an A/B generic, its injector is different and perhaps more difficult to use, so it may be worthwhile to get your PCP to prescribe both medicines for you in order to decide what you want. As far as the generic goes, if you download the coupon from the link below, it says out of pocket you can save $300, and since its cash price is only $109, the coupon should make it free for literally everyone.\n\nAnd there are programs like the $4/$10 deal that Walmart and others do. I know CVS/Target uses ScriptSave, and for some maintenance meds it brings it down to $4.\n\nTl;dr: Read the links. \n\nEdit: I found this using the GoodRx app. This is one of the most versatile tools at the hands of patients, doctors, and pharmacy workers alike in keeping drug prices in check and it's FREE! I use it everyday I work whenever I see expensive drugs, and it helps like 80% of the time. It is NOT insurance, and the downside of using its discounts is that your payments won't go to your deductible, but if you're like me, and you'll never reach your deductible, you should give it a shot and compare it to how much insurance will pay. While it doesn't tell you how much your insurance will charge you, it does tell you generally the cheapest(Walmart, although I have heard from some coworkers that Walmart doesn't take GoodRx at all) and most expensive pharmacies (lol CVS most of the time) and provides its own discounts that sometimes beat insurance especially if you have a deductible. The Tips tab on GoodRx can help you find if there are manufacturer coupons you can sign up for. Manufacturer coupons only exist for brand name medications and typically only cover 30 or 90 day supplies, and the 90 day supply is almost always cheaper. GoodRx is accurate almost all the time in displaying coupons, but it isn't for the EpiPen, which just discontinued its full coverage program, instead replacing it with one that could \"potentially\" save you $300. Seriously, screw Mylan Pharmaceuticals. I'm deathly allergic to nuts and legumes so I have to have an epipen and I had to pay $535 out of pocket so this issue is personal to me. \n\nCVS Pharmacy Tech here!\n\nTo clarify you have to get a prescription for ADRENACLICK OR EPINEPHRINE in order for us to fill the medication.\n\n\nThere is also a patient assistance program that will allow you to receive Adrenaclick for free by the manufacturer Impax Laboratories. Here is the website (http://www.epinephrineautoinject.com) Present us the coupon at drop off with your prescription pretty please!",

Does this happen regularly?\n\nI get that with some generics the active ingredient is the same but the other stuff that controls delivery/absorbtion rate can be slightly different. But surely the cheapest option with the same amount of active ingredient should be the default and prescribed in 99% of cases? Only prescribing the more expensive option if it's demonstrably better for that particular patient or if they specifically ask for it?\n\nI always thought that a non-generic was only superior for only a very small set of drugs and for people with particularly niche circumstances and those prescriptions should only be happening very very rarely. Not often enough for posts like this to exist. In the case they do need the brand name, the patient should know they are getting the more expensive drug and given a reasonable explanation why by their doctor. These warnings should not be necessary at all. Something must be fucking rotten.\n\nA doctor has a duty of care to their patients and that should include not fucking them over financially, especially when costs are this high. The justification being that it's not good for your mental health or physical health if you keep having to shell hundreds of dollars every time you need an epipen. Some people might even go without because of the high prices and put themselves at serious risk. We're not talking about the generic 30p paracetamol vs the brand name one that costs a few dollars. This hundreds of dollars, for a lot of people this price difference (even with insurance with deductibles/excess) is enough to cause some *serious* hardship.\n\nEven if they default to the expensive and change it if you ask for it, not everyone is educated about this and it's still fucked up. I would even go as far to say that it was just straight up corruption as their must be some kind of kickback involved for a doctor to do that.\n\n",

Their lack of existence didn't demotivate the Millenia of technological advancement and art before their existence, and the nigh-on mythical individual inventor isn't helped by patents when the application fee is thousands of dollars.

I don't know about epipens specifically, but the average drug costs $1-3billion to bring to market. On top of that, less than 1 in a 100 drugs make it to market. And then the patent then typically expires after 10-20yrs. \n\nSo in that time the drug has to make back it's billions, and compensate for all the other 100+ drugs that made zero money at all. That's why medical tech/drugs are expensive, the actual production is usually trivial. \n\nFrom what I gather, Epipens are indeed overpriced though, even with that in mind.",

That means, you get a monopoly on it for 18 years or so, but after that, anyone can freely use the technology. The alternative would be companies hiding their knowledge as trade secrets. So the patent system may be worth fixing.\n\nHaving some way of rewarding content creators isn't bad either, copyright and its implications are just fucked up. Maybe restricting  it to commercial activity would be the best. Or just abolishing it, tbh.",

The movie you made a couple months appear on the screen. You freak out. Disney had directly copyed your movie and is now trying to make money from it. You run out of the theatre and check that OMG! critics are loving the new disney film. Disney's newest original movie is predicted ti make 2 billion dollars in the next month!\n\nand you can't do anything about it. copyrights don't exist, the government doesn't care who copys who. now disney is profiting off your idea and you wont see a penny of revenue. Disney used their big name to influence people to come to the movie. and now the movie is spreading across the nation like wildfire.\n\nthis is why copyrights exist. to protect the small artists. not the big ones.",

As much as I loved to help customers it ties me up just waiting on the phone when I could have helped other people in line and I know/understand that you guys hate waiting in line and try to get to everyone in an orderly fashion.\n\nEdit: I used to work in retail as a tech. I fully understand that part of my job is those kinds of calls. But I'm trying to advise you of what you can do to help me, my coworkers, and the customers in line. You ever stand in line at a pharmacy and had to wait a long time before we could help you, guess what I may have been on the phone with insurance/doctors because I have to fix something, that is part of my job, that could have been resolved at the doctors office but now I got 5 people in line just waiting, tapping their feet, getting angrier by the minute, then maybe at some point decide to leave because waiting was unbearable. I put myself in your shoes many times because I'm a customer myself in many places such as banks, pharmacies, grocery stores, etc. \n\nI was always courteous and happy to help with any issues, believe me. One such incident I remember was a doctor telling a patient they were going to get amoxicillin and whoever gave the patient the prescription had it down for ampicillin. The only reason I made the call was because I was having small talk with the patient at the register and told them if they have ampicillin before. The person got confused because they were adamant that the doctor was going to prescribe amoxicillin. The patient never looked at the prescription and it was a printed text prescription, so none of that messy doctor writing. Conversely, they could have just thought that it was probably brand name. But you know what, no problem, call doctors office, give phone to pharmacist to take order and fixed. All in all about 10-15 minutes while the other techs helped those in line and I'm on the phone and instead of helping those in line change to filling electronic orders or refills.\n\nI'm just trying to give a little perspective on retail pharmacy. I used to work at a 24 hr CVS in Irvine and let me tell you, there was never any downtime. 5-6 pharmacist and 3 techs typing, 3 techs filling, and 2-3 on register. ",

    "body": "The second part of your post isn't too mind-boggling, actually.  It goes back to the DAW rules and how your benefits are setup.  More and more companies are putting DAW penalties in place to get people onto generics and off of the brands.  \n\n\nBasically, if your doctor writes the Rx for the generic inhaler and you go and ask specifically for Ventolin, that is what we call 'DAW 2', which means the substitution to the brand drug was requested by the patient.  In these cases, a lot of companies are putting 'DAW Penalties' in place - essentially making you pay a ton of money for that brand, because in their eyes you're just being irrational and you should get the generic, so why should your company foot the bill and not you?  The penalties vary by company - some only charge an extra $10-20, while some (as in your case) will make you pay for the whole cost.\n\n\nSome companies are even putting in place penalties on DAW1 prescriptions.  DAW1 means the doctor wrote the prescription for Ventolin, and essentially said 'only give the brand Ventolin, no generic alternative.'   It sounds like you're not subject to this, but some companies will STILL charge you a penalty because now they think your doctor is being irrational and she should be prescribing the generic, so again, why should the company foot the bill?!\n\n\nAs an FYI, there are always exceptions to this.  If this ever happens to you, you may have to jump through some hoops, but if you and your doctor can communicate to your benefits provider that the generic does not work and the brand is needed, they will not/should not subject you to these penalties and you should be able to get your Rx for the standard copay amounts.",

Doctors get paid based on visit type and any interventions/procedures they do, not by what medicines the patient receives.\n\nUnless you're talking about like from a pharmaceutical company, which has been strictly regulated and is illegal. So if anyone's doing that, that's illegal.\n\nOr unless you're talking about a medicine that the doctor makes and prescribes, which is also illegal.\n\nETA: Certain drugs are a certain level of restriction, too, so some third party reviews the prescribing habits of each physician for drugs in certain classes, and if it's fishy, that gets shut down/something illegal is probably happening (\"pill mills\") and they get arrested/license revoked.\n\nWhat mainly determines generic vs. non-generic seems to be \"what is the most effective drug for this pt that will cost the PATIENT the least to receive.\" If it's generic, that's what they prescribe. If it's some fancy drug, then they get that prescribed.\n\n**ETA2:** I'm not saying that doctors don't receive money from pharmaceutical companies. Many do (although many practices straight-up ban it). But that's SEPARATE from their salary as physicians. They get $$ which then makes them more likely to prescribe brand name drugs. I have read PLENTY on it, had many lectures and classes on it, and deal with it very regularly. I know it's real and fairly common. :)",
