    "body": "My mother got the opportunity to interview him once. He was late due to traffic, so there was a group of about 100 school kids and media sprinkled in who waited for hours. He finally arrived about two hours after the start time for this interview. He delivered a speech, apologized profusely and stayed for HOURS to make it up to these kids. He introduced himself to every single person and talked to them and had a genuine conversation with them. He really took the time to make sure everyone who came to see him, got to see the real him. Its a story my mother always tells me, and it reaffirms the character of this man. \n\nEDIT 1: I'll talk to my mom and get the fully detailed story. Thats just the synopsis, will update soon!\n\nEDIT 2: Full story\n\nMy mother was interning at a local DC tv station and they booked Ali during the prime of his career for an interview. So they schedule an interview and he ends up being around two hours late. So everyone at this station is pretty pissed off that they're waiting hours for this guy to show up - thinking he was like every celebrity of the time and thinking that the world revolved around them. News gets out and a bunch of kids come out with things to autograph and all that, and a crowd forms around the station. So about two hours after the allotted time a large black limousine pulls up and a bunch of rather large black men get out followed by Ali. The men proceed to rush Ali telling him that he has to go and how they're late and they have no time. Ali turns to see the crowd of kids screaming \"Ali! Ali! Ali!\" and turns around to his entourage and says \"No, we can wait. I got some kids to see.\" He then proceeds to take an hour to meet, talk, and chat with every single kid there and made them feel like they were the only kid at the event. So after that hour rolls around he finally gets in to the station and my mother is going through the paperwork with him and he apologizes profusely and says that he'll stay as long as he needed to make up for the time. He does the interview, and meets the entire station and once again, makes sure that everyone in that station got to meet him and have a genuine conversation with them. My mother said he ended up staying something like 4 or 5 hours after everything was said and done. \n\n\nOverall a really humble and generous guy. \n",

    "body": "I lurk, but this was worth sharing.\n\nAli meant so much for so many, I have a story. Feel free to read on.\n\nI grew up a very poor minority,  a white boy named Muhammed in a little Italian town right outside NYC. I wasn't \"white\" since I wasn't European or Italian. I didn't get along with the black or latin kids since I was too \"white.\" There were no other Arabs around, and I was a rarity, I was an extremely fair skinned, black haired, brown eyed kid with a name that could not escape the identity people wanted to associate with it. \n\nAdults, kids and everybody else passed judgement on me, which of course is human nature, only I didn't have anybody who could share that pain, someone to cope with... I was alone. 9/11 went down and I was like an Island. I was cursed and chased and beat for something as much my fault as the weather. I was disrespected and emotionally wrecked for a name I didn't give myself in a town I didn't choose to be in. I was ashamed of myself, of my name, and so I struggled very much. \n\nThe first time I heard about \"Ali\" was in passing when two men in a local pizzeria argued he would never best Rocky Graziano in a match. It was sometime later that I heard his full name \"Muhammad Ali,\" my lonely young self could not resist finding out more. I found stories and clips, I watched movies in the library and found out everything there was to find out. I found a man who was revered as a Champion because of his boxing prowess. I learned that he was Cassius Clay. I learned that he also grew up rough. I learned about the hate and adversity he faced. I learned about his dedication and training. His ability to both fight for what he believed in and stood for, but also to recognize and accept people would always react differently to it, and that had to be accepted to keep moving forward. I learned that he not only took the name I was made to be so ashamed of, but that he was proud of it, and insisted people use it. I learned what it meant to me to live everyday like a champion, to fight back, to stick my chest out and work hard and earn respect, and to keep my head up when it was not given. \n\nA man I had never met, and will never meet helped me through an obscure, isolated part of my life. He inspired, supported, and willed me to take pride in who I was, all without ever uttering a word to me, and that, that is what made him a hero. That is the reason I will always be grateful for Ali. I sincerely hope he can Rest in Peace.\n\nEDIT: Formatting. Guys thanks for the warm comments, it means a lot. \n\n/u/Ooomar and the anonomyous users who gilded me thank you so much. You're awesome.\n\nEDIT 2: As /u/BeforeRedditWasCool pointed out, it may have been Rocky Marciano young me heard the men speaking about, not Rocky Graziano. This is likely due to the weight class differences. Although old Italian men are sometimes known to argue about silly things so not sure.",

Frazier always held a grudge with Ali (rightfully so after Ali called him Uncle Tom, among other nasty epithets, a few times in their history), and was almost gleefully watching him tremble at this event.   \n\nAli quietly announced to Frazier that he was still faster than him and was willing to prove it in front of all the guests.  He bet Frazier that right there, he could throw 30 punches in less time than Frazier could.  Frazier excitedly accepted the bet, sure that he'd finally get his come uppance.  He took off his suit jacket, asked someone to ready the stopwatch, stretched his arms, and prepared to begin.  He then threw his 30 punches in 5 seconds or so.  The crowd oohed and ahhed at the speed of this 60 year-old elite athlete.  \n\nThen it was Ali's turn. He slowly got up from his seat, with assistance.  An aide helped him take his jacket off.  He stood for a few seconds, hands hanging at his side, the crowd hushed, and Ali slowly looked up and mumbled, \"How long did that take?\"\n\nThe crowd erupted in laughter.  \n\nFor one last time, Ali had bested Frazier.

He could float, sting like a bee, dance in the ring, rap and rhyme like an Original MC, drops his hands and leap forward with a devastating left hook, rope a dope in The Jungle, thrill in Manilla, and continue shocking the world like he did in '65 after knocking out Liston. \n\nWas he the greatest boxer of all time? That's debatable. Most give it up to Sugar Ray Robinson. Ali definitely wasn't the strongest. The meanest, hardest, most powerful punches belonged to Tyson, Shavers, Lewis and Foreman. \n\nBut Muhammad Ali became something more than a gifted boxer, an Olympic Gold winner, a Heavyweight champion: he became a legend and an icon.",

Family friend excited told me it was Muhammad Ali and I decided I wanted an autograph that he was handing out. I tried to make it into the throng of reporters and people but could barely get through when all of the sudden Ali saw me struggling. He reached out, grabbed my hand and pulled me through the small crowd. Took a minute to ask me my name, a few things I don't remember, and if my caretaker wanted an autograph too. I did so many reports on him growing up because of that moment.

We dressed up as cartoon characters and entertained kids at birthday parties. One party in Philly hired 4 of us to dress up at Teletubbies for a young girls birthday (I don't remember the age.)\n\nWhen we arrived, the mother took us in through the back door to a room where we could put on the costumes. She said that she'd give us the rest of the money (usually half up front, half afterwards) and that there'd be time after the festivities for autographs. I assumed she meant for the kids to get the Teletubbies autographs, which was pretty standard for kids to ask.\n\nWhen I walked into the living room, dressed as whatever the red one was named, there sat Muhammad Ali. The party was for his granddaughter and he was genuinely enjoying watching the kids have fun. It took me a minute to remember what I was supposed to be doing and started entertaining the kids, fighting every urge to shirk the costume and meet him.\n\nAfter the party, we changed back into our street clothes and the mother of the birthday girl brought us into the kitchen (a small eat-in kitchen) and gave us a piece of cake, glass of milk, and an envelope with the rest of the money. Muhammad Ali came and sat down with us after a minute or two and he just chatted about normal, everyday things. It was so surreal to sit face-to-face with The Champ and talk about cars, the weather, and politics (Bush had just been elected.) I was only a teenager and he talked to me like I was his equal. As though he wasn't the most accomplished boxer in history and I wasn't some stupid kid still wet behind the ears.\n\nHe then autographed a few pictures he had in a drawer and we went on our way. He genuinely cared about the 4 of us and what we had to say and I will never forget how kind he was.",

As the story goes, Ali, decked out in a huge fur coat walking two beautiful women under his arms, finally gave in to the reporters and gave them a quick show. \n\nHe dropped his arms from the girls and handed off his fur coat to someone in his entourage then put his hands up, open palmed, on either side of his head. Then he told a reporter to try to land a punch on his hands. The reporter's swings missed wildly as Ali slipped them out of the way at the last second. \n\nThen Ali made the reporter put his hands up and told him not to let him hit them. The reporter put his hands up and Ali got into his stance, rocked back and then shot out a jab that slammed into the poor reporter's palm, causing him to bring it down and watch it turn pink as everyone around him laughed and cheered. Ali put on his coat, grabbed his gals, and the lot of them disappeared around the corner, leaving my grandfather with a stunned look on his face and a story to be told for decades to come. \n\n\n",

    "body": "Ali was a monster to Frazier. When Ali came out of jail Frazier lobbied endlessly for him to be allowed to box, let Ali stay in his house, gave him one of his cars, and gave him full use of his gym and boxing trainers. Ali thanked him by calling him both an uncle tom and a gorilla - on the one hand criticising him for not being black enough politically and on the other for being too black aesthetically.\n\nI'd also argue that Frazier bested Ali. Styles make fights and I'm not saying Frazier was better overall but in their 3 bouts I'd say Frazier comes out on top: \n\nHe was the clear winner of the first one when they were both at the absolute peak. Ali won the second but there's nothing in it - it's almost as close to a draw as you'll ever see. The third one absolutely is as close to a draw as you'll ever see and the most brutal match you will ever see. Going into the 15th round it does look a lot like someone might die and so Frazier's trainer throws the towel in but actually Ali was simultaneously asking his trainer to concede, you can hear him jelling \"cut my gloves off\" on the mic. Ali only wins in that Frazier's trainer acted faster. You see how they both react to the news in the fight: Ali immediately faints, Frazier's standing in the middle of the ring saying \"no way man, no way, I can still fight\".\n\nAlthough to be fair to Ali after that third fight he would not talk about anything except what a great boxer Frazier was and it's actually quite moving to see in the press conference the way Ali is obviously humbled and awed and in no way triumphant. That final time, and for the first time in his career, he was actually magnanimous in victory and that speaks very well of both of them.",

One time (I can't remember exactly when, but I think around the 70s) they met Ali in a hotel in NYC. He was either there for a fight or something else, I can't remember. I think it was a fight, but I'm not 100% sure.\n\nAnyway, they met Ali in the hotel lobby and shot the shit with him. My neighbor said that he was very warm and friendly. A down-to-earth kind of guy. He told my neighbor's son (<10 years of age) that he could punch him in the face as hard as he can. Instead his son hit him in the stomach. Ali picked him up and said \"Why didn't you do what I told you?\" The kid responded with, \"Because, I didn't want to hurt you.\" He gave the kid a big hug and was apparently very touched by the moment.\n\n\nNot a super interesting story, but I just wanted to add in another story that highlights his humbleness/greatness.

More musicians aren't dying: you just know more of the ones who are. Every year there will be a rapid increase in the number of famous people you recognize who die. This is because you know exponentially more young famous people then old ones (and a few other factors I'll explain below).\n\n>Think about how many actors and musicians whose name you recognize. Hundreds and hundreds of them, if not more than a thousand. Now, let's assume that the majority of those people are between the ages of 30 and 65 right now, with a bias towards the younger side. In 2015, you may have recognized the names of 10-20 celebrities who died, but in 2030 it will be more like 100. Every year after that it will grow and grow, until eventually you will have heard that nearly every single celebrity you knew at this age has died. Old people experience this now, but for us it will be far worse because 1. there are many more celebrities now than there were back then, 2. celebrity name recognition is higher due to the media and the Internet, and 3. we're becoming increasingly clued in on people's deaths because society is becoming more connected.\n\n>So, my point here is that the \"this year is so bad!\" mindset isn't exactly accurate. If anything, this is the least depressing year (for celebrity deaths) that you'll ever experience.",

He also has five or six of moments that a hundred years from now will still be considered pantheon moments in sports history: The free throw dunk, the shrug, the shot, the flu game...I could go on.\n\nThat doesn't even touch his impact on the sport itself. After Bird/Magic waned, he basically saved the NBA and brought back an entire wave of popularity.

People that didn't even like boxing would go see Ali just because of the dance. The man's footwork was hilarious. My mom hated boxing, but she would drop what she was doing to come see the power that Tyson was throwing in his 30 second fights. It's a skill that commands notice and respect. \n\n\n2) completely shit on your opponent and all of his training. These guys train harder than most and they know the opponent may have a little more speed or a little more power, but as long as you make a plan and execute that plan, you can connect. If you can connect and they lose any momentum, you can strike and YOU become the hunter. Ali doing stuff like this is so demoralizing to an opponent. He just showed him that all of his training and plans don't mean shit. Unless the ref is gonna let him tie Ali to a seat and beat him with a baseball bat, he can't win. Nothing he brought into the ring is good enough. He's going to lose as soon as Ali decides to try. He's going to lose. \n\n\n\n3) all of his future opponents are watching this. Everyone is watching this. He is embarrassing this man. His arms are out and down and this guy still can't get a shot? Ali is literally winning a boxing match without boxing. Ali is winning future fights before he even steps in the ring. So you watch him piss on this guy that is giving his all just to TOUCH Ali and then your gonna sit at the press conference when your time comes and listen to him make fun of you. And all of the reporters ARE GOING TO AGREE THAT YOU'RE GONNA DIE. Then when the press are done because Ali says he's hungry or has a movie to get to, he's gonna stand up, look at you and probably do that little dance. A billion flashes will go off as everyone laughs. \n\n\n\nAli did these things to fuck with his opponents now and in the future. He won fights before he had to swing.",

During a tour of Australia in the early thirties, England had to come up with a new bowling method know as Bodyline just to counter-act Bradman's seemingly miraculous run-taking. As you can imagine the Bodyline doesn't sound pleasant because it wasn't. The basic premise was to bowl a ball at the body of the batsman to cause him to deflect the ball towards a fielder.

You're one of the best. 60+ has only been achieved by a tiny handful, six people, including Bradman himself.\n\nIn cricket, scoring 100 runs in an innings is a huge achievement. A good player will have 20/30+ in their career. You get a standing ovation from the crowd, your name is put on the ground's honours board, you need to be a stand out player to achieve it.\n\nSo on average, every time Don Bradman got out in the top level of cricket, he scored 99.94 runs since he was out the previous time. \n\nIf we don't factor dismissals into this calculation, Bradman scored 87.45 runs every time he batted (using the formula of runs / innings batted). That's 12.55 runs away from scoring a century, which is one of the biggest achievements in the game of cricket or even in sport in general.\n\nI hope that kind of expressed how big of a feat it was.
