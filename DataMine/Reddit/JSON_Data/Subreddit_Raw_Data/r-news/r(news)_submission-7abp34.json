The police outed him as being gay too. Because he used the pics to try to pick up a male college freshman. The young man committed suicide.\n\n\n\nThese laws are extremely broad and over inclusive.    \n\n\n**Edit**: \n\nThis was from a presentation given by [Detective James F. McLaughlin](http://www.ottawacountysheriff.org/documents/mclaughlin.pdf) of the Keene Police Dept. It was part of a PowerPoint presentation on cybercrimes that he gave at my law school. He talked about cases that tested the limits of the law and used this \"John Doe\" as an example. As he was 16 years old, and not charged as an adult, the defendant's name was protected pre-trial ([More info here](https://communications-media.lawyers.com/privacy-law/identity-protection-in-court-cases.html)).  My guess is the family's embarrassment or shame precluded voluntarily releasing the identity posthumously. I don't know why this stuck with me over the years. Maybe it was seeing his face and thinking, \"that easily could have been me.\" \n\n\n**Lucy Carillo** was the prosecutor who worked with this case. [She resigned later for other reasons](http://www.unionleader.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20120617/NEWS06/706179924/-1/news). As a thought experiment, I said \"if a video is just a collection of fast moving images, why don't you charge 2000+ counts of images for possession of one video?\"  I was actually joking with her.

Is it because we think they have not been rehabilitated? *Then let's make sure we rehabilitate them before giving them their freedom back.* Is it because we don't believe it is possible for them to be rehabilitated? *Then we shouldn't release them yet.* Is it because their prison times and fines were not sufficient punishment? *Then raise those times and fines.*\n\nAt best, the sex offender registry is a band-aid on a broken arm of a prison system. It is not helping and only serving as a distraction from real improvements.\n\nThere's a reason there are constantly problems around these laws. As other commenters have pointed out, taking a picture of yourself can classify you as a child sex offender. It's stupid. Despite what we have been taught, maybe these types of laws are a bad idea. To me, this is border line thought-crime territory. How can taking a picture, possessing a picture, or sharing a picture be a crime--regardless of what is in the picture? Obviously actual abuse should be a crime--and it is. But making pictures illegal is just a lazy way to avoid having to investigate real crimes. You can have pictures and videos of murders, terrorism, rape, animal abuse, etc. all day long. Those are perfectly legal. The inconsistency is very telling.\n\nIf you want to stop child abuse, then put your resources into fighting child abuse. Not tracking down people who downloaded a picture.\n",

If you take a nude selfie at the age of 17, you might not be able to find a job, housing, etc. \n\nAnd what's more, if you can't find a place to live because of the laws preventing sexual offenders from living within proximity to a million things, you get sent to jail for failing to register a residence. \n\nSo adding it to the passport next is idiotic, unless we plan on putting in the whole host of crimes people commit.

They were kicked out of their homes and no other foster home would take them because they were \"sex offenders\" so they got shuttled to this group home.

    "body": "Statutory rape is one of a very small number of what are called strict liability crimes in the United States (NOTE: Criminal statutes are state matters not federal matters, so this differs by state.  There are many states where statutory rape is NOT a strict liability crime and your friend would have been able to use this evidence to assert his lack of knowledge.  I am speaking about those states where it is strict liability).  \n\nA strict liability crime is one where we drop the normal legal requirements to prove mens rea, or state of mind.  This is generally because these crimes are such where we have deemed that either it would be impossible for you not to know, or we don't care if you didn't know, or the societal burden in proving you knew is not worth the costs.  Because of this \"I didn't know he/she was underage\" is not a legal defense whereas it ordinarily probably would be.  \n\nAs you might imagine, strict liability is very rare and only applied when explicitly called for in statute.  Speed limits are the most common strict liability crime.  If you are driving 55 in a 25, we don't care if you knew or not, you're guilty.  Drunk driving is a less common but emerging one.  In some states, if the blood alcohol limit is .08 the state has to prove not only that your BAC was above .08 at the time, but that you had reasonable basis to know you were over the legal limit.  Other states cut out that step and say if your BAC is .09 that's enough.  \n\nDrug possession is another one, with regards to quantities being strict liability.  As you probably know, drug crimes are of different severity and carry different sentences based on the amount in your possession.  In many jurisdictions once the prosecutors have proven you knowingly carried meth with the intent to sell, we don't care about whether you knew it was 50 kilograms, or if you thought it was only 20.\n\nYou can probably see the rationale for all of these, even if you don't necessarily agree.  Speed limits are to save the court time on trivial offenses, drug quantities make it easier to target organized groups that use drug runners, the drunk driving one just follows logically, etc.  The statutory rape one is rather more controversial, and was originally only applied to instances where the victim was below the age of ten, for reasons which should immediately seem obvious.  Whether or not statutoty rape should be strict liability in all cases, is another issue.\n\nThat being said, there is legal precedent on your friend's side which has been adopted nationwide in United States v. Kantor, which creates a \"good faith\" defense against crimes in which the victim intentionally tricked the defendants into a factual mistake thinking that no crime was being committed.  Unless your friend's case was more than 20 years ago, I'm surprised he was still found guilty if he had all that evidence you said.  Unfortunately access to competent public defenders is sorely lacking, and our courts don't always operate in practice the way we say they do in theory.",

    "body": "Now ~~imagine~~ consider being an 18 year-old guy with a 16 year-old girlfriend, and you decide to fool around with her. Then her parents get mad and file charges. Then you get snatched up, forced into a registry, marked as a gross pervert by the government. You've got a picture of yourself on the registry, your current home address, but no way to defend your charges. You're forced to go to group counseling and pay a fee each time you go. One time, 10 years later, you can't pay the fee, so you can't attend. That violates your probation. You get put in jail for 2 years for violating probation, then come out worse than you went in. Nobody will hire you because you're a registered sex offender and a con.\n\nThis is literally what happened to my buddy.\n\nEdit: consider vs. imagine. thanks /u/pupomin",

A friend grabs a friend's phone, finds the nudes and sends it around; a guy sends nudes he got to his friends under the pretense of keeping it a secrett, but it spreads and so on. In the case of minors, shit like that is distribution of child porn and can end up wider.\n\nEdit:\n\n> It's part of society at this point due to smartphones and the internet. \n\nHeck, this type of stuff goes back to the early 00s. I remember some guy sending nudes to girls on MSN Messenger and they printed the images out and plastered it across school.

It's inherent in any imperfect decision-system that there are Type-I (false positive) and Type-II (false negative) results.\n\nWhat we do is stack it towards making false negative results (acquitting the guilty) rather than false positives (convicting the innocent). But it irks me when people say \"should we let people be wrongfully convicted\". It's like \"should we let people crash cars\".\n\nSee also [N Guilty Men](http://www2.law.ucla.edu/volokh/guilty.htm)",

    "body": "This is following what Australia has done, ensured that sex offenders can't travel to large areas of Asia where child prostitution/exploitation is common. It's actually prevented a lot of travel and saved many children from, at least some, exploitation. \n\nNote: Australia is not marking passports, but actively preventing the travel of those with child sex offenses and this is a collaboration with Asian governments/border agencies - particularly Thailand and Vietnam.\n\nLegislation found here: http://www.loc.gov/law/foreign-news/article/australia-legislation-preventing-child-sex-offenders-from-traveling-overseas-enacted/\n\nIt's a new piece of legislation and I do not know of any studies regarding it's impact/effectiveness as of yet. I hope it yields positive results. If you reduce demand of sex tourism then you hopefully reduce supply. \n",

    "body": "Why?  I presume you want to protect children?  So two options for you:\n\n1) Someone is interested in kids, so they decide to go to see a therapist about it.  They haven't harmed a child but they have downloaded CP.  The therapist reports them to the police.  The police arrest them, jail them, and five years later they are released and put on an open register.  With job skills five years old, an unexplained hole on the resume, and a guaranteed failed criminal background check wherever they apply, they can't get work.  Because of the registry they can't find housing.  They are now unemployed, living on the street, and untreated - they have nothing to lose. \n\nvs.\n\n2)  Someone is interested in kids and they are either identified by the state, or go to a therapist on their own.  Either way they are not punished but rather they are helped.  Their therapy is paid for by the state, for as long as they need.  If they have a job working with kids, the state pays their salary until they can find a new job (which the state again asists them with).  Five year later they have five years of therapy under their belts, they have a job, a house, everything in the world to lose.\n\nWhich one of these people is more likely to snatch a kid who happens to cross their path?",

I was falling into psychosis at the time due to being Schizoaffective. When the officer came to my house I couldn't utter any words. I just kept opening the door, staring at him for a minute, then closing it several times. Finally he said \"[my last name] (between 15-19 yrs old I frequently was taken to the psych ward by the police, so a lot of the officers know me and my address), we're not going to play these games today, and he tackled me into my own home. I was so confused. I just went limp with my mom screaming in the background, \"STOP! He's mentally ill! He needs help!\".\n\nHe took me to jail and charged me with Battery on a LEO, Resistance W/ Violence, Obstruction of an Officer's Communication Device and a couple other minor things, even though I didn't even fight back. He literally dragged me from the foyer of my mother's home down the concrete driveway with me being shirtless while I lied motionless on the floor consumed with shock and utter confusion. \n\nI spent the next 31 days in 24 hour lockdown solitary confinement at the county jail, hallucinating severely and entrencehed in delusion. Such as believing I was trapped in purgatory, my body melting into a puddle with my cell consumed with flames thinking I'm leaving purgatory and descending to hell. I remained in psychosis for 3 months after my release where I experienced the Messiah Complex and God Complex. I wrote a Bible. I was so out of it.\n\nI'd like to say I've recovered rather well from everything. But I wish police knew what could happen if you press false charges on a person. I was in jail so long because they wouldn't let me out until my attorney did everything required to present an Insanity Plea to the prosecution. My attorney said that once she presented the Insanity Plea the State Attorney dropped the case and it was no filed. I have no criminal record today thankfully, but I still have a mugshot posted online that doesn't look so good.",

Stuff like that is disturbingly common. A guy in, I wanna say Maine, got murdered because he was on the registry for assaulting a minor. He was 18 or 19 and it was his, like, 16 year old girlfriend. \n\nThere are myriad problems with the registry. Too many to go into here. But the vagueness of it is one of the biggest factors. Or, in some cases, its selective specificity: it'll name the age of the victim but not the age of the person who committed the crime. So the registry will say \"so and so had sex with a fifteen year old\" but won't clarify that this occurred when the perpetrator was 18, it will then stay that way forever. So if someone looks up the offender when he's in his mid-30s it still says it. ",
