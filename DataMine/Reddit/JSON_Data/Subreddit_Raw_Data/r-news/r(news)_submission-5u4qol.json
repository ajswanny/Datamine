I am not just referring to elected officials, but **All moderate Republicans, especially voters**. All politics is local, and those politicians ultimately vote in line with their constituents. Gone are the days when officials could be trusted on their principles, now they respond most to explicit mandates thanks to the introduction of the verb *primaried*. I would like to point out we are already seeing some backlash in the form of [angry town hall rebukes of Republican congressmen](http://www.washingtonpost.com/video/politics/angry-utahns-pack-chaffetzs-home-state-town-hall/2017/02/10/8ca75d8e-ef80-11e6-a100-fdaaf400369a_video.html) and [Marco Rubio's recent rebuking of McConnell's invokation of Rule XIX to silence Warren](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=5XycsE4FICg). We can debate how Rubio was personally motivated to enhance his profile, but I would argue it should still be praised.\n\nWe have all heard the same tired lines about how we need to reach across the aisle, or get out of our silos and all of that talk is self-serving bullshit unless we are willing to do something uncomfortable and praise our adversaries when they do the right thing. We need moderate Republicans to be couragous not because they are heroes or are the moral arbiters here; they are not. I could say until I am blue in the face that Republicans chose political expediency over human rights, national stability, cultural civility and just plain common decency, and be correct. And it would change *nothing*. It just feels good to go one a monologue, which I am dangerously close to committing myself right now, but it changes nothing. As an educator, basic behavior management dictates that positive praise for good actions is highly effective in improving behavior in problematic students. I do not see how this is any different. After all, we are all the heroes of our story, so let's appeal to moderate republican's hero perspective, and call them to action.\n\n",

    "body": "This is the basis for the term Fake News, which quickly changed definition to just badly written or biased journalism, when in reality, it was a VERY large concerted effort on Russia's part to destabilize, usually by creating stories that were ultra nationalist and pro-america, but helped deepen the divide we currently live in between the left and right. And it wasn't just targeted at us. \n\nSeriously, If you have the time, this investigative article about Russia's Troll Army is pretty amazing to read. If you don't have the time, make it. It's one to the most interesting articles I've read. \n\nhttps://mobile.nytimes.com/2015/06/07/magazine/the-agency.html\n\nStarts to make you wonder about the \"alt-right's\" online presence and how many of their outspoken, faceless voices are who they say they are and are from where they say they're from. (see note below)\n\nI had thought it was pretty crazy and dangerous that the Trump administration and others in the gov't were watering down the term for something that's been having devastating effects on our country, in order to use it to \"erode trust\" (get it?) in our media and polarize the people. Then it all started to make a lot more sense in my head when I considered all the rumors back during the election about the Trump teams ties to Russia.  This sort of almost confirms it for me. \n\nSo much of what we've seen in the last month is straight out of Putin's playbook, most notable being the creation of a government issue reality and claiming that the media is the opposition party. \n\nThen again, you'd think that there would be a better term than just Fake News, but I guess State Sponsored Trolling doesn't really have an air of urgency to it.\n\nEither way, today is going to be very very interesting. \n\nNOTE: \nI don't want this to come across as pointing fingers at the right. I'm a lefty, but i'm an American first. \n\nI used the alt-right community as an example because they have one of the loudest online voices, but it's not a one sided thing. \n\nThey're almost definitely playing us off one another. Both sides are receiving disinformation, both sides have digital agent provocateurs stirring things up online, so don't think that you're immune. and remember that when you start arguing left v right. Or more importantly, change your arguments into discussions.\n\nIf Russians are trying to divide us, Russians are our enemy. The dude that you're fighting with online about whether its a muslim ban or a travel ban, is an American. He's your brother. \n\nThe chick that's telling you why it's her body, her choice. She's your sister. Try to remember that. And if you agree. Spread that message. We just need to change the tone. We all want the same thing. \n\nDisagreeing is democracy and Compromise is the goddamned American Way. \n\n",

Because, you know, I'd be banned for doing this there.\n\nHere is the federal statute Conway violated:\n\n>5 C.F.R. 2635.702:  \u201c**An employee shall not use his public office** for his own private gain, **for the endorsement of any product, service or enterprise**  ...  including nonprofit organizations of which the employee is an officer or member.\u201d  \n\nConway is a federal employee. Conway endorsed a product.\n\nMichelle was not a federal employee.\n\nBut wait, my sweet trumpet. You saw someone say in that thread that federal courts ruled that FLOTUS was a federal employee!? They ruled it about HRC no less! These bastard liberals and their bias, how could they forget!?\n\nWell actually, we can read:\n\n>We, therefore, read the phrase \"full-time officer or employee of the government\" in FACA to apply to Mrs. Clinton. **In doing so, we express no view as to her status under any other statute.**\n\nWhich means the precedent would have no binding as applied here, to a wholly different federal statute than the one at question in the case being parroted there. They in fact make that holding wonderfully explicit.\n\nhttp://m.openjurist.org/997/f2d/898/association-v-clinton\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________\n\nFor funsies, from /r/Shit_Gibbon:\n\n>Michele was a legitimate government official. The office of the first lady is a part of the executive branch. She was bound by 100% of the same rules that Conway is.\n\n>http://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/23/us/court-rules-that-first-lady-is-de-facto-federal-official.html\n\nRead as: \"I was incapable of reading a relatively brief case so just googled it and this was the first result.\n\n>[In response to \"Michelle wasn't a government employee\"]\n\n>She had a staff* paid for by the government. She had policy initiatives and everything. That's about as legitimate as it gets.\n\nYo dog, I heard you think Malia and Sasha Obama were federal employees because they had white house staff, so we put shit legal analysis in your shit legal analysis so you can shitpost while you shitpost as legitimately as it gets.\n\n>Michelle was able to get laws passed for kids lunchs, she might as well have been a politician.\n\nCan someone make a school house rock vid on how anyone including a literal shit gibbon can write and send legislation to a rep and have them introduce it on the floor? *Fucking legislation, how does that work?*\n\n>This is how the \"Drive By Media\" works. They sensationalize a non story like Kelly Anne Conway's public pitch for Ivanka's clothing line. Then, when WE (the based Pedes) catch on to the utter hypocrisy, because their own do the same shady shit but worse\n\n\"I have literally no idea what federal statute people are discussing, but these shit-libs are on some hypocrisy. Catch me outside, how bow dat.\" Edit: Also, lol \"based Pedes\"??? Smells a lil...podesta pizza-ish in here ( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0). Sure you guys wanna go with that one?\n\n>When we say \"You say (insert here: Conway, for example) was wrong, but look at (insert here: (Michelle Obama, for example) did the same thing!\" Are we saying both Michelle and Conway were wrong, or are we saying both of them were okay and proving the lefts hypocrisy?\n\nI don't think any of us have any idea what the fuck your saying, because the ethics violation is predicated on a legally defined status that one of those people don't have.\n\n>It's easily explainable - She's black, and in modern America, that's a free pass to do anything without criticism or responsibility for your actions.\n\nPreach dude (+9 btw).\n\n>Pretty sure as FLOTUS she is not beholden to the same ethics rules as a senior staff member to the POTUS.\n\nDamn, actual truth, in *my* /r/shit_gibbon?\n\n>They will spin this as \"Subway promotes healthy eating so her doing this was in the best interests of the children\", but don't buy it.\n\nNutritional menu options for children? lib-cuck spin jared was a pedo PIZZA PODESTA EMAILED ABOUT PIZZA\n\n>Don't forget how many free Subs Sasha and Malia probably got in compensation. How is that not the same as Ivanka receiving profits from the companies she owns? If Michelle can promote Subway and her daughters can profit by getting free subs why shouldn't Kellyanne be able to promote Ivanka stuff so that she can profit money????\n\n\"Don't forget about this thing I have no proof of that I just literally invented happening. How are these hypoethtical obummer sammiches that probably happened not leterally same? Why can federal employee not commit ethics violation because probable obummer sammiches???????\" (+10 what in the fuck lol?)\n\n>They're excusing her because she wasn't a federal employee- which isn't true. The office of First Lady is officially part of the executive branch AND a federal court ruled in '93 that FLOTUS is a govt official. Here's a failing NY Times article on it: http://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/23/us/court-rules-that-first-lady-is-de-facto-federal-official.html\n\n\"It's not fake news when its the first google result and I refuse to read the actual case cited. Still failing tho.\"\n\nIma just end on this one because it has a weird kinda projection vibe to it:\n\n>REEEEEEEEEE AUTISTIC SCREECHING\n\n>dems you are P A T H E T I C lol\n\n[Goodnight shit gibbons](http://i1.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/117/982/1297836486170.jpg).

In other words, agencies will use the raw data to spy on foreign individuals across the globe and American citizens in the United States.>      \n    \nThe NYT ran a similar article, but didn't include this information.      \nAs a matter of fact, I've tried to corroborate www.wsws.org take on the whole thing, but there is *very* little information about it on the internet.      \nIt's almost like even mainstream media didn't want to tip off the incoming administration.      Nothing from loudmouths like Fox or washington post.      \n\nIt also may be why Congress has been dragging their feet to do cabinet appointments, as once those appointments are in, Congress has to rely on them to do the *right* thing.      \nNew CIA director Pompeo blocked Flynns assistant from getting clearance for classified information.      \n**there is no plausible deniability if they've been survailing them this whole time**.     \n\nIf you ask me, this is all signs that it's about to *really* hit the fan.       \nand geez, it's about time. cuz, like he's been in office like 3 years already, right.

Ryan has a political history of masking his ambition behind a facade of \"answering the call to serve\" meaning he has consistently ascended the ranks of the party by waiting patiently until he appears to be the only qualified choice to fill a leadership role. This happened at the committee level (ways and means) and when he became speaker. If the Trump campaign is seriously implicated in working with or complying with Russian interference in the election or after trump took office, Vice President Pence most certainly will be implicated too. At that stage, Ryan succeeds them to become president. Ryan most certainly was not involved, and he's staying out of the fight so his potential rise to the presidency won't be questioned, just as he had in the past.  Chaffetz takes his orders from the speaker; if Ryan wanted the house to investigate Chaffetz would.  Ryan is sitting back, letting the senate do the work to discover if there's fire where the smoke is coming from. If allegations are true, and there is solid grounds for impeachment, Ryan will move.",

He wrote that as a legislator in the Pennsylvania Assembly. The Assembly were trying to tax lands owned by the Penn family to raise money for defence of the state during the French and Indian War, but the governor kept vetoing the bills because he owed his job to the Penns.\n\nThe Penn family finally came to the idea of offering the money to help pay for defence spending, but only on the condition that the legislature would concede that they did not have the power to tax the family's land. Franklin's statement was meant to say that if the legislature was willing to give up their power to tax in exchange for purchasing a little temporary safety from the Penns, they (the legislature) deserved neither their power nor their safety.\n\nIt's not at all a quote about individual liberty against the whims of an Orwellian government, and given how negative people felt about taxation in the 1750s, Franklin being willing to tax them to provide for the common defence is pretty much the opposite of the modern spin on the phrase. The common man definitely would've considered being taxed giving up liberty in exchange for security, as borne out by events like the Whiskey Rebellion.",

There's a reason he took Crimea but not Donetsk and Lugansk Oblasts when he had the chance in 2014. Possessing Crimea has strategic value to Russia, as that's where its Black Sea fleet is based. The strategic value of mainland Ukraine is as a buffer between Russia and Western Europe, and that's best achieved by destabilizing the current government until Russia can do as you said and reinstall a puppet government like it had with Yanukovich before the Euromaidan movement.\n\nI don't claim to be an expert on Eastern European realpolitik, but I did live in Ukraine at the end of 2013 and through 2014, and these are the conclusions I've drawn from that experience.
