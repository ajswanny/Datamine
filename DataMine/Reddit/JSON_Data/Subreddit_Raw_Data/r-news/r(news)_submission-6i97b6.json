    "body": "This man's family has my deepest sympathies. \n\nEvery time I hear something like this, or literally anything about North Korea and anybody from any country other than NK, I wonder why anybody still allows non-essential travel there for any reason. The DPRK is not one of those polite South American dictatorships where they kidnap you in the night and you are \"disappeared.\" In the North, they grab you in broad daylight in front of everyone, and depending on what you did and your importance to the government, they can and will use **anti-aircraft cannons** to execute you, burn the scraps with *flamethrowers*, and let the wind sweep your ashes away. (Yes, this actually happened recently).\n\nShit, man, you see literal zombies wandering the countryside there and then realize those are living humans who ran out of crystal meth that they were eating instead of food, and are just waiting to die. \n\nA few years ago, I met with a career adviser and he told me some time back he got the chance to go to North Korea. He said it was a very socially cold place at best, and that at one point an older man walked up to him and gave him a look of deepest and purest loathing, like he wanted to kill him just for existing. He was glad when he wasn't there anymore and he never went back. \n\nEvery time I see a story about the North's unceasing brutality towards human life, I think about how loads of people just insist on visiting there for literally any reason, and I just don't get it. I don't give half a shit what Dennis Rodman says, that guy knows fuck-all about what the Kim family and the military have done to innocent people, and yet here Rodman (and probably others) come up and say, \"They're not so bad, we got to know them real well. Obama needs to call Jong-un and work things out.\"\n\nOnly reason Jong-un ever said that was so he could crow far and wide about how he got the American Bastard President at his beck and call. \n\nI really hope this story spreads like a goddamn rash. People have to stop giving support (and potential hostages) to North Korea, or anything other than disgust and a fervent demand for massive reform. The North already gets a huge shit-ton of illegal money to fund itself (their Club 39 is a government agency that creates and sells tons of narcotics, which they have \"officials\" then sell like junior drug lords and the scientists who make them take the recipes home to replace their vanishing actual food; they can defraud insurance companies of tens of millions of dollars; and many other acts), so people have to make the conscious decision not to support them. \n\nI know North Korea has done any number of things that prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that they are outrageously stupid (their invasion tunnel under the DMZ; claiming a literal \"unicorn cave\" was found; the Kumgangsan Tourist Region being a shit-you-not Evil Disneyland where they shoot people for breaking rules; kidnapping a film director to force him and his wife to make a Godzilla rip-off), but then you read about shit like this and realize they are very, very serious when it comes to hurting people. \n\nPeople like this man.\n\nI keep hearing about how the North is marching straight off a cliff, how control within the country is faltering because the Kim in charge isn't half the man his father was and how the military can't pull a coup and install itself as a direct junta, because they know they'll actually be getting a worse deal, about how people are secretly getting glimpses at the outside world through bootlegs and whatnot, but now this cartel has a nuke arsenal and their human rights violations aren't letting up and their end seems that much harder to visualize.\n\nProbably my comment will be removed, but I really needed to say this. The family still has my condolences, and I hope more people take caution to heart after reading of their plight.",

Some American soldiers gave them leftovers from a meal they had when they saw my dad and his family.

She's made some really stupid and ignorant statements, we all agree on that.

Arguing against her or worse, hurling abuse, will almost certainly only serve to entrench her opinions. The only way she is going to change her mind is with some wake-up call that random internet strangers cannot and should not provide. The best argument against this is radio silence.

North Korea has had since the end of the Cold War millions of people die in famines, and has virtually no advanced domestic economy to speak of.\n\nWhenever North Korea falls I have no idea if the South Koreans are really willing to reunify or not, but the costs of reunification are going to be enormous.",

The politicians themselves kick competitors out of power by alleging each other as \"sympathizer of communism.\" Former president of SK, the one who received a Nobel Peace Prize for coordinating a historical meeting with Kim Jong Il also was found to have paid a hefty bribe to the regime. So, one could say NK has always been an element of the operation of SK government. \nI do want to see NK regime fall apart in my life time since I know for a fact that my distant relatives are in NK.

I could only imagine what that situation would be like, so it wouldn't be entirely too far fetched that he tried to hang himself, was semi successful due to negligence by his guards, then found unconscious. this also explains the utter lack of other physical damage (which sure could have healed with time). Regardless, NK is at fault for outright lying that he contracted botulism then never woke up after a sleeping pill. That is gross negligence in itself, but I think it's a more believable story (by any rational thinker) than the fact that NK didn't understand what would happen if they beat and murdered a detained US citizen.",

Basically depending on the size of the lens there is a minimum size of an object that you can differentiate from another one. This is called the Rayleigh Criterion. The relation is D\\*sin(theta)=1.22\\*lambda where D=diameter of lens, theta=angle between two objects, lambda=wavelength of incoming light\n\nLet's assume perfect conditions: No atmosphere, 300km altitude, purple color and you only need to see a few distinct objects on the 42.7mm ball (so lets go with 10mm target size). \n\nAt 300km distance 10mm is 3.33x10^(-8) radians. To distinguish that you would need a lens of diameter ~14 meters on the satellite. Hubble for reference is 2.4 meters. \n\nSo no, it is very unlikely that satellites have been launched with lenses that large. Drones or other relatively close cameras on the other hand might be able to. ",

US doctors are saying scans revealed loss of brain mass consistent with asphyxiation and no evidence of botulism. He was completely unresponsive to all stimuli but was wakeful (sorry I don't remember the exact terminology but it's basically a persistent vegetative state). The father has said that his son was brutalized while in NK custody, but I've not researched into it to verify that claim (I doubt there's anyway to actually verify it, tbh). At this point, we don't know what happened to him, only the results. \n\nIMHO it appears that the guy passed away while in NK hands, under unknown circumstances, and out of fear of having an American dead in their hands they revived him. NK kept him in that state for unknown amount of time before releasing him to the US on humanitarian grounds. \n\n",
