The damage done by these entities is farther reaching and far more subtle than any bomb or army. Yet these groups remain almost entirely untouchable. A fine that doesn't even equal the profits made by the crime is not a punishment.\n\nBy making this kind of treatment unaffordable to most of the population (the same thing that has been happening to diabetics for decades) you  are indirectly systematically killing off a population. To me that sounds an awful lot like a for - profit genocide in which the survivors are indentured servants to medical debt. \n\nAgain this may sound a bit harsh but I worked in a retail pharmacy for a few years and saw this happen every day. This shit makes me sick.

There's no monetary incentive to find inexpensive cures.  Patent laws should be changed such that if a treatment is more expensive and doesn't drastically improve the patient's quality of life, then it should either have no patent protection or a very short patent period.  Additionally we should calculate the actuarial present value of the most expensive treatments projected for the next 10 years.  If a new treatment provides a better quality of life and saves $$, then it should get a portion of the savings and normal patent protection.  These rewards would easily be in the billions of dollars range.  It would align society's desires (cheaper and better treatment options) with corporate interests (profit).

Here, the FDA is only able to look at efficacy and then the pricing is some real Wild West stuff with insurers. Ugh. \n\nEDIT 2: Obviously there is a lot of controversy about the marketing > R&D statement above. I got it from an academic presentation at a grand rounds and I will try to compare the sources of the information. I suppose regardless the amount spent on marketing would surprise people.  I appreciate the thoughtful comments from people defending the spending, also. These companies fund a lot of research and I would be in trouble without them so I am not trying to pull out a pitchfork, but unfortunately the profit motive always creates conflict. We pay much more for a lot of cancer drugs in the US than they do in Europe, for example. I think there is also a bit of willful ignorance to say these scandals only involve small generic pharma companies. We have seen misconduct by major companies in trials for avastin, pradaxa etc. I am sure there are many examples people can conjure. ",

    "body": "No, more money is not spent in advertising drugs than making them. \n\nI do have some numbers, though keep in mind that there are a large number of ways to slice and dice the numbers, so it is pretty easy to show them in other ways.\n\nI'll be using Pfizer in 2012 as the example here, which had one of the largest advertising budgets of 2012.  They spent $622 million on direct to consumer advertising (TV, radio, magazine ads).  This is the thing that most jumps to mind when people hear \"Marketing\".  There are estimates that drug companies spend ~7x marketing to physicians as they do to consumers (training sessions, reps to try to inform the physicians about the new stuff, etc).  So combined marketing to consumers and physicians is ~$5 billion.  \n\nNow, how much did Pfizer spend on R&D in 2012? Their R&D budget was $7.9 billion.  That means that their marketing budget was ~60% as large as their R&D budget.  \n\n[source](http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2013/05/23/another_look_at_marketing_vs_rd_in_pharma).\n\nPart of the reason why some numbers make marketing look larger is because many numbers come from the \"Sales, General, & Accounting\" line in budgets, which does include marketing, but also includes stuff like legal fees and rent. [Some discussion on this](http://www.fiercepharma.com/regulatory/does-pharma-spend-more-on-marketing-than-r-d-a-numbers-check).\n\n\n Aadvertising\" (which is generally interpreted as direct to consumer TV/Radio/Newspaper/Magazine ads) is a very small fraction of their costs.\n",

I watched a video about it and one of the victims said his school had a specialised unit for treating Hemeophilliacs. All of the children got HIV since they all recieved the tainted blood products.

And you know these days, modern pharmaceuticals, cancer drugs can cost $100,000 or more, rare disease drugs can cost half a million dollars.\n\nHis feeling was that he could charge anything, because to save your life you would pay anything, and he wanted your entire net worth. He felt justified in extorting everything you had worked your entire life for in exchange for a pill that cost $1 to manufacture, because he owned it and controlled who got it.\n\nThese pharmaceutical, insurance, banking, oil, energy, financial, etc. companies have been riding the gravy train for decades, and they have come to feel that the obscene profits and executive compensation they have been receiving are an entitlement that can't be removed. Well, when their profits come at the expense of people's lives, then the entitlements have to end. They were lucky enough to live in a Gilded Age where profits were unlimited, and they got rich beyond their dreams. Now they will have to satisfy themselves with their fat bank accounts and tell stories to their grandchildren of the days when they were able to allow people to suffer and die to increase their profits by a mere 1%.",

Because we have this senseless lovechild of the socialist/capitalist systems, prices in healthcare are completely arbitrary even though it's theoretically a capitalist system.

He also didn't say that they'll own the water. Now please don't take this comment as defending this horrible excuse of a company. I'm not very knowledgeable about Nestl\u00e9's malicious practices, so this is strictly speaking to the video's content, but doesn't he make a point with water being a very precious resource and that in an ideal world it'd be good to ensure it's not being wasted and that's it is equally distributed? Forgetting the fact they want to charge money for it for now. The basic premise makes sense to me - filling a pool with water shouldn't be a human right when there are thirsting children in Africa, so I guess I could agree there, although I most definitely wouldn't be for monopolizing water in the hands of Nestl\u00e9.",

You may think you want opiates for the euphoria, but you really just want to be able to take them.  This is an odd concept.  Nora Volkow gave a very interesting talk a couple years ago where she showed evidence that drug addicts (granted it was for methamphetamines) actually get their dopamine release upon receipt of acquiring the drug, not upon ingestion or effect.  \n\nSo where you think Tramadol is great because the euphoria is down, it is really just hitting the u-opioid receptor just the same and your brain is happy because you are getting opiates.  It doesn't need the euphoria anymore.  \n\nI don't really have some wonder alternative to be honest.  If this ends up working for you, then that really is awesome!

While I don't need it as often as I used to, I'm just grateful to find something that works for me.\n\nGood luck in your recovery!",

If you make a new insulin that lasts considerably longer then you should be able to patent it and profit from your invention.  If the difference isn't significant then don't buy it and get the old stuff.  The main thing with insulin vs regular drugs is its much easier to get a patent for it since its a huge complex chemical where lots of potential changes can be made vs drugs which are much simpler.  As long as there is a generic company making the cheap stuff then thats really all you need until the expensive stuff goes off patent (if you really desire the expensive stuff) ",

In the legal sense of free speech, its recognized that a lot of harm can come from just words and sometimes the public good outweighs the legal right. \n\nIf people want to split hairs on legal parts then technically this company followed the law. They could sell it for a different price under a different brand name and refuse contracts that they don't like the price on. \n\nPersonally I don't agree with looking at it that way. But thats where you get when you start pointing to a harmful action and saying \"yeha but thats legal\". \n\nThese are peripheral points to the parent comment and comment you replied to. Theres a reason we don't do public hangings of board of directors based on potential cause of harm, and we prosecute people who have shown to cause actual harm. \n\nEven if I agree with the gut reaction of how immoral what they did is, when you start saying we need to prosecute them as basically war criminals you open up a whole new set of legal/moral questions and his point about people who effectively change issues through propaganda are open to discussions on how they should be treated by the law, even if what they did was legal, but morally corrupt. \n\nTheres no easy answer here. Governments simply don't have the capital through revenues to create and distribute drugs the way pharmaceutical companies do. These companies exist because of incredibly high profit margins so legislating them to lose their profits runs the risk of them just getting out of certain fields of drug development. \n\nIts not an equivalency. But you know seeing these things is a good time for reflection. We all get mad at seeing an article like this. But you, me, everyone else in the 1st world get a bit morally righteous but turn a blind eye to other companies doing actual harm when they provide goods and services to us. \n\nCould just be the severity? I dont know. The idea of someone dying not being able to get reasonably priced medicine gets people mad. Especially when almost everyone has had a friend or family member who needed these types of drugs.  Walmart / Apple / GAP / etc using child labor in horrible conditions and we all pretend that doesn't happen. Point is if theres some serious idea of moral outrage. Maybe people shouldn't just be a part of the transient when its a news article on pharmaceuticals.

I agree with most of what you have said and I've read similar if not the same research.  \n\nI don't know if I'm just a special one off case or what, but Tramadol is working great for me and in occasional tiny doses at that. Several months ago I was taking my opiate of choice every two hours - dosing on the clock every two hours all day every day. A lot has changed since then, but currently I am taking one 50mg Tramadol pill in the morning, and a 2nd before bed. Starting tomorrow those pills get cut in half and I'll only have two more days of Tramadol use - a total of seven days on it.  \n\nLong term use of Tramadol leads to some major problems. It is indeed very addicting - something I absolutely wanted to avoid. Same with the higher doses, I'm not using it to feel good I'm using it because my opiate of choice also hit the Mu reception as well as acting as a SSRI. Tramadol basically does the same but without the euphoria. I like to think I'm taking a small enough dose that I still suffer WD a bit, but it's giving me a gradual stepping stone down.  \n\nThere are quite a few other stories online about Tianeptine addicts using Tramadol to quit. I'm not alone here. Maybe it isn't effective for other opiates, but in this case it seems to be the most effective substance to help us out. \n\nMost importantly is having the willpower and mindframe to not only quit, but to stay away as well.

We'll have the New Confederate States of America that will look much like it did during the Civil War, except Texas, which will be its own sovereign nation unto itself. Then there will be the Midwest and rust belt which will take a Native American name like Sequoyah or Iriquois. Then there will be the Rocky states, and I can't think of a name for them.

You do have a somewhat special situation and your awareness of the addiction potential (and what addiction actually is) is also somewhat special.  Most people just don't know the first thing about addiction, or believe that they couldn't possibly be addicted because that is reserved from illicit drugs, not drugs prescribed by their doctor.  It is unfortunate, but very common.  \n\nI didn't mean to insinuate that what you are doing is wrong in any way. If it works, it works.  I just wanted to point out that this is not exactly a common case and that tramadol isn't a great replacement drug for all opiate addicts.  \n\nCongrats on finding your way out of the opiate cycle and best of luck to you in maintaining your new life without opiates.

If you need anyone to talk to during the final process of getting off the medicine I'm here!

The ER must treat an emergency, but they don't have to give out vials of insulin otherwise.\n\n2.  If you are lucky enough to have some $$, then go to Wal-Mart and buy Novolin insulin that is dated in terms of the formula, but will still keep you alive.  I believe Wal-Mart will sell a vial of it for $25.\n\n3.  Beg your doctor for a free sample of insulin.   If you're lucky, they'll have one to give you.\n\n4.  After the recession in 2008-2009, there were some T1s in the US who would go to a store or bank, demand money (aka robbery), then wait for the police so they could get insulin in jail.",

When he made his pilgrimage to Mecca, he threw around so much gold that he fucked up whole economies.\n\n> Musa made his pilgrimage between 1324\u20131325.[17][18] His procession reportedly included 60,000 men, including 12,000 slaves who each carried 4 lb (1.8 kg) of gold bars and heralds dressed in silks who bore gold staffs, organized horses, and handled bags. Musa provided all necessities for the procession, feeding the entire company of men and animals. Those animals included 80 camels which each carried 50\u2013300 lb (23\u2013136 kg) of gold dust.\n\n>Musa gave the gold to the poor he met along his route. Musa not only gave to the cities he passed on the way to Mecca, including Cairo and Medina, but also traded gold for souvenirs. It was reported that he built a mosque every Friday.\n\n>Musa's journey was documented by several eyewitnesses along his route, who were in awe of his wealth and extensive procession, and records exist in a variety of sources, including journals, oral accounts, and histories. Musa is known to have visited the Mamluk sultan of Egypt, Al-Nasir Muhammad, in July 1324.[20]\n\n>But Musa's generous actions inadvertently devastated the economy of the regions through which he passed. In the cities of Cairo, Medina, and Mecca, the sudden influx of gold devalued the metal for the next decade. Prices on goods and wares greatly inflated. To rectify the gold market, on his way back from Mecca, Musa borrowed all the gold he could carry from money-lenders in Cairo, at high interest. This is the only time recorded in history that one man directly controlled the price of gold in the Mediterranean.",

    "body": "> Most emergencies end up being a race between companies to see who gets there first. \n\nFake news. Ambulances companies don't race each other to calls. That hasn't been a thing since the 1970s. Even in that era the companies that pulled that stuff ended up getting washed out or [bought up.](https://www.amr.net/about/affiliates) When a 911 call comes in, the closest ambulance is usually dispatched. In fact this is [the law](https://malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartI/TitleXVI/Chapter111C/Section1) in many places. There is a *theoretical situation* where if there was an *extremely high acuity call* two ~~ambulances~~ emergency vehicles could be dispatched to the same location to insure the quickest response. In addition, it's sometimes nice to have two ambulances worth of Paramedics (e.g. 4 dudes) versus your standard 2 when you've got a patient suffering a cardiac arrest, for example. Every ambulance has to write reports, and those reports are watched through a process called Quality Assurance and Quality Improvement. \n\nPrivate ambulance services are held to the same standard, if not higher, then municipal services. Private ambulances are licensed at the state level as services, and all of their employees are also licensed at the state level. Many are nationally certified and registered. In New England, many municipal services run at the bare minimum level (called ~~EMT Basic~~ Basic Life Support - EMT) while private services run at the maximum level (Advanced Life Support, Paramedic.) Of course it's not like that everywhere, but that is common in many places in the US including Massachusetts. \n\nSo before I get to this next part... I am a former firefighter. I have a lot of friends on many fire departments, both career and volunteer. This is an insiders perspective based on my experience, and no disrespect is meant to anyone on the fire side! When they're needed, [they're needed.](http://www.necn.com/news/new-england/2-Buildings-Collapse-During-Massive-Fire-in-Portsmouth-NH-418837014.html)\n\nA lot of the fire department is the gold standard brouhaha is just the IAFF (Fire Department Union) trying to make private EMS look bad because they see private companies as anti-union (although the biggest private in the USA, AMR, [is union](http://uemsw.org/)) and they see private EMS providers as [scabs.](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=scab) The FD union set up a good deal for most firefighters, and ~~most~~ cities don't make a dime on their FD. The fire department has been trying to \"put themselves out of business\" with fire *prevention* for years. It's starting to work. Now that things don't catch fire as much anymore, firefighters are being called out less and less frequently. Lower call volume means less budget and staffing. This threatens their retirement, \"pensions,\" medical benefits and over all -- their jobs. If the firefighters also work the ambulance, it increases their call volume and protects their jobs. That is what a lot of this is about. This is also why a lot of ~~big~~ cities will automatically dispatch a fire engine to a medical call for something like Chest Pain. Police also use this tactic, and a cruiser responds to most 911 calls these days *in a lot of communities.*\n\nThere will always be shitty private companies that primarily do shitty transfers, ~~[of shitty patients,](http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/04/27/article-2613851-1D64F83300000578-371_634x878.jpg)~~ out of shitty nursing homes, run by shitty nurses -- in shitty trucks with shitty medics... but that is a poor representation of private EMS, and they're performing a necessary function. I know **a lot** firefighters who hate EMS and just want to do firefighting who are quite shitty when on rescue calls. These guys are my friends.\n\nSource: Former Boston Metropolitan Area Municipal FF/P, *and* Private Paramedic, current ER Physician and (private) EMS Medical Director\n\n> My own city recently had a big jurisdiction legal battle over which areas of the city \"belong\" to private enterprise.\n\n\nI don't know anything about your city. My thought is perhaps that there were communities that signed contracts with private companies *because they were providing a better service* (e.g. faster response, higher level of care, more units available) then the city department. My thought is perhaps the city is saying \"well we're the city department, so we get \"first dibs\" on all 911 calls\" and the private department is saying \"but the citizens *prefer us.*\" Boston EMS will \"triage\" 911 calls. They will utilize their resources based on acuity.  If you call in with a non-serious sounding complaint, they will send their ambulances to the serious sounding calls first. You could be waiting a while for that 25 year old male with back pain ride while they go out for a 70 year old women in respiratory distress. When you think about it, this makes sense. If you call a private company, they'll *probably* come right away. This is purely conjecture, but demonstrates my point.\n\nI saw a battle like that happen here... and to be honest, I tend to side with the privates. People should have a choice in the service they use, and a government funded and enforced monopoly on emergency services doesn't leave much room for choice.\n\n**EDIT:** Cleaned up the post a little.",

    "body": "Well....do keep in mind that what you see on the news is what the major media companies want to show you.    They simply aren't going to show you all the people being screwed over by healthcare in the US since most of their advertisements are from pharmaceutical companies.\n\nBut your concern is quite valid, though perhaps for different reasons than you think.  The real issue is that young people, and people who otherwise have not been sick, fool themselves into thinking that the health care issues aren't their problems.  They'll be just fine.   It's only when they end up with cancer, need surgery, have a chronic illness, etc. that they then realize the lies they believed to be truth.\n\nI think people in the US are waking up (in a most unpleasant manner) to these facts though.   I know several people who have to pay around $1200 a month to keep their family covered with health insurance, then have to pay 5K out of pocket before it even pays for anything.   \n\nThe thing about the US, historically, is that people seem pretty docile about issues like this until suddenly they most decidedly are not.",
