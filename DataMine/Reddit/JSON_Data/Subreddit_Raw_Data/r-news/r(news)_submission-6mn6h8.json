The thing of value and the contribution is incriminating evidence against Hillary Clinton. The email also lays out (as a bonus!) that the Russian Government is acting to help Mr. Trump win the election, and Trump Jr. knew about that, and knew that he was meeting with Russian government officials to solicit this information (illegal!). Lastly, Kushner and Manafort are CC'ed on these emails and there's no possible way Donald Trump himself didn't know about this situation. That's *at least* 3 people, with strong implications of Trump himself as the 4th, who, at the very least, *attempted to* collude with Russia to win the election.\n\nSo.....yeah.....there's your collusion.\n\n**EDIT:** Apparently additional context is needed here. For those wondering, It is a crime to solicit or accept anything of value from a foreign national in a campaign. The 4th email from Trump Jr. clearly shows they were going into the meeting with the intent (key word) of getting the information (the thing of value) from a foreign national, and the email also lays out pretty clear that Trump Jr. solicited the information. \n\n**EDIT2:** For those of you trying to say \"nothing of value was expected to be discussed or discussed!\", and are trying to deflect to the myth that they were discussing Russian adoption bullshit and that going into the meeting that's what was expected, let me refer you to the actual emails, please pay attention to the subject of the emails and also the content:\n\n> From: Rob Goldstone\n\n>Sent: June 06, 2016 12:40 PM\n\n>To: Donald Trump Jr.\n\n>Subject: Re: Russia - Clinton - private and confidential\n\n>Hi Don\n\n>Let me know when you are free to talk with Emin by phone about this Hillary info - you had mentioned early this \n\n>week so wanted to try to schedule a time and day Best to you and family Rob Goldstone\n\n\nand \n\n> From: Donald Trump Jr.\n\n>Sent: Wednesday, June 08, 2016 12:00 PM\n\n>To: Jared Kushner, Paul Manafort\n\n>Subject: FW: Russia - Clinton - private and confidential\n\n>Meeting got moved to 4 tomorrow at my offices.\n\n>Best,\n\n>Don\n",

It's a fuckload.\n\nI'm so sick and tired of being told \"Trump ['s team] did this or that\" as if it matters, because it incredibly clearly does not.

I wasn't a fan of Obamacare when it first came out but it would be stupid to root for it to fail. That wouldn't help out the country at all.

    "body": "> I think Trump (Sr.) made a deal to give them sanction relief, and that's what will get his head on a pike. \n\nMaybe.  Russia had several goals:\n\n1.  Sow chaos in American democratic processes, to get us focused internally instead of watching what was going on in international areas of focus.\n\n2.  Weaken the US influence in the world by diminishing our standing.  Making our electoral process appear fraudulent furthers this goal.\n\n3.  Prevent Hillary from getting elected, because she would make life difficult for Russia and not let them get away with things on the International stage.\n\n4.  Get someone elected who would be willing to lift the sanctions imposed for their invasions of Ukraine and Crimea.\n\nWorking with Trump lets them achieve all of these goals.  Goal #1 and #3 have been achieved.  Trump is actively working on goal #2 through his sheer ignorance and disdain for everyone that isn't him.  Goal #4 may or may not have been achieved.  Trump wants to lift the sanctions but he can't just do it on his own while the heat is on.  That's why he wants Russiagate to go away.  If he can get our attention focused elsewhere (war with North Korea, maybe) then he can lift the sanctions while we are distracted.\n\nKeep in mind that these were a \"wish list\" of Russian goals.  They've already had far more success than they expected, and if Trump becomes too much trouble or too uncooperative then they can suddenly decide to release incriminating information on him (not the Steele Dossier, but more likely transcripts and secret recordings of the deals that they made) and bring him down.  Then we'll spend god knows how long digging through that mess.\n\nJust bear in mind that there is no good ending here.  Trump staying in power means massive losses of American political goodwill and capital, and possibly the destruction of our standing in the world.  Him spending the rest of his life in prison for treason might be justice, but the damage to our political system will have been truly severe.",

Under that light, colluding with Russia would be plausibly excusable (morally speaking- not legally, lol). \n\nAs long as he's perceived to be battling against some perceived threat, he can continue to cut taxes to the rich, while ignoring the working class. He's perceived to be occupied by fighting \"illegal immigration\" or\"mainstream media\" or \"terrorists\" or \"the liberal elite\", or any number of other groups. By distracting people with news, he continues his agenda.\n\nInsulting and belittling Trump supporters won't help us.

The repeated meetings with Manafort, Flynn, Kushner, and now Don Jr. (all meeting they lied about repeatedly) all point to a pretty obvious case of quid-pro-quo.\n\nAnd if you see what's coming out of Russian media lately (which is all controlled by the Kremlin), the Russian gov't is getting increasingly frustrated with the Trump admin. Which all tells me that they thought that having this quid-pro-quo with Trump and his admin would mean quick lifting of sanctions, but that the stupidity of Trump and his team is making that nearly impossible (I mean, imagine if they announced plans to lift sanctions *now*, it would scream of collusion).\n\nBasically, Russia thought helping Trump was in their best interest, they did so, but only after gaining tacit agreement from Trump campaign that they would be willing to lift sanctions, only the campaign/transition team/administration is so inept that all this info has leaked out to the press and into the open (also, FBI being on their heels) means they can't comply with their part of bargain. Now Russians are getting uppity, Trump's admin is seeing the walls close in, and that's why, I think, we're seeing such erratic behaviour from everyone there.\n\nThey say, \"sometimes it's not the crime, it's the cover-up\", well I think in this case it's both.",
