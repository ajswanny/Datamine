This is 1871.\n\nThe Vatican obtained to teach the Catholicism in school in 1929. No one ever even thought to teach what's in the Bible as fact in schools ffs.

That number in 2013 was down to 43%! Meanwhile, Democrats went up from 64% to 67% (both parties are the same am I right?). There are some differences by race (only 50% of black protestants, who are mostly democrats, believed in evolution), but that is much better than only 27% of white evangelicals that believe in evolution. Additionally, black people do not throw their weight behind politicians who promise to ban evolution or teach creationism on any national scale.     \n      \n*Edit: I pointed out the race thing to remind people this is an issue of religiosity, as much as political affiliation, but since the Republicans are the party of the religious it manifests itself in bad policy exclusively on the right.",

    "body": "Few people know how carbon dating works. It's complex AF and variable AF and the materials can be as contaminated AF.\n\nBesides, it can't be used on dinosaur fossils. They're not from the dinosaurs, and carbon dating can't go back nearly that far.\n\nDinosaur 'fossils' (let's drop the formal definition  of fossil and go with the colloquial one) are not dinosaur bones. Instead, they are the collection of minerals *in the shape of that bone* that accumulated where the dinosaur decomposed. There is no organic tissue in a dinosaur fossil bone - it's all rock and mineral. See https://www.amnh.org/dinosaurs/dinosaur-bones/\n\n\nThere is genuine reason to question the evidence of dinosaurs. When the first few were discovered, they were about as credible as crop circles. What the hell are these giant bone-shaped rocks doing inside normal-looking rocks? We've never seen a creature anything like that, and it's big enough that someone could have made it by hand if they really, really wanted to and found a way to settle the minerals quickly (small, intricate skeletons would be harder to do right).\n\nBut when the next few were found and we started figuring out how they were formed, the evidence became convincing. \n\nOh, and most fossils of the cool dinosaurs in museums are not even the real fossils. They are castings of the fossils. The fossils that were actually dug out of the ground are almost always in storage shelves under the museum. So, the museums only show a (man-made) casting of a (natural) casting of a dinosaur bone. Man-made castings require 2 separate phases (because we use molds), so overall that's 3 orders of separation from the original dinosaur.\n\nI really wish museums explained this better, and had a few of the real fossils of the more common dinosaurs on display so visitors could get a better understanding of the things we dig out of the ground.",

It does sound like, as I thought, it's really down to where in America you're talking about.

The biggest offenders are the ones who deny the existence of dinosaurs (or evolution) and the shape of the Earth. The basis for 90% of their arguments is \"This is hard to wrap your mind around, so it's probably not true\" but they don't actually do anything to disprove any of the evidence. They also make very large assumptions to start then twist everything to fit their beliefs from there, cherry picking when to trust science and when not to. I'm also surprised at how many people there are out there that don't understand that even if you somehow disproved evolution or that the Earth is a sphere, you still have to provide irrefutable proof of your alternative claim, as well as prove the existence of a \"conspiracy\".

    "body": "The amazing thing, to me, is that IIRC we have calendars that started more than 6000 years ago. The Chinese calendar goes back before the supposed flood of Noah (and presumably Noah's descendents went to China, found the calendar, filled in the gaps, and decided to keep using it and pretend that nothing unusual happened)\n\nThat's good evidence of a continuous line of human history going back before the universe was supposedly created. Stonehenge is older than that, lots of ancient sites are older than that\nUnfortunately, the written/carved/built/etc record starts to taper off around 4000 years ago, and gets fairly light about 6000 years ago. Or viewed from the other direction, about 4000-6000 years ago humans started making things that would last longer and be more noticable. We didn't have much evidence of the first American civilization  (which dates back to 6000-3500 BC, and it doesn't quite fit the definition of a civilization that we normally use) until the late 1990's. When I was in school, the oldest American civilization we knew of before then was the Olmec, dating back to 1600 BC.  And the oldest known civilization with lots of good solid evidence and writing is from 3500BC, which matches pretty well to the Bible narrative. But of course it would, as they're from the same area and the Bible is a collection of old stories that were passed along in that civilization. Then some guy came along and called himself Jesus and threw everything into disorder.\n\n\nAs a historical achievement, the old testament is very impressive - it's a set of stories that had passed around for hundreds (maybe thousands) of years before the Bible was put together. It's all inaccurate, but that doesn't change the impressiveness that humans were able to preserve stories for so long. Jesus (if he existed) was going around and preaching the old testament - many of the same stories that are available in churches today. It's very impressive to keep a tradition running that long, especially an odd one that is really irrelevant to us.",

Evangelics are hardcore descendants of European \"Puritans\" and are generally associated with the passionately religious in America. \n\nLong Eli5 Answer: \n\nCatholics believe the Pope and the bureaucratic religious structure called the Papacy is a group empowered by god to run the religion/world. This is called a Theocracy - a religious government. Back in the 1516 on Halloween a philosophy nerd named Martin Luther wrote a pamphlet called now \"The 95 theses.\" In this he claims  bible did not support the Pope/Papacy that was running the Medieval world. Lots of German princes who were paying Taxes to the pope, or felt his arguments had a moral decided to agree with him. Then 50 years later German had 30 years of brutal warfare where every power in Europe faught quite bitterly over this religious divide. (See Thirty Years War)\n\nSkip ahead abit, some weirdos in England were all about banning Plays, Music, Dancing, and Drinking. They were called Puritans and they were the stuffy moralizing Christians you sometimes see today. They felt Europe was far to scandelous and moved to America, which they treated as some sacred unspoiled land to create a new true christian nation. They believed in this idea called Manifest Destiny. This refered to the idea that it was the destiny of the Colonists (Americans) to take over all this new land, from sea to sea. so they kicked out the heathen Natives and started to expand into the west. Lots of people who were religiously motivated moved out west, believing it to be a country to be tamed and turned into \"God's Land.\" There's a bunch of stuff in the bible about God rewarding the faithful with a wonderful land - they took this to be America. These guys eventually turn into Evangelicals of today. Despite their rejection of sin, to the point of banning dancing, they somehow believed in dumb stuff like magic, and witches and speaking in tongues. In effect (And in my opinion) they went so far into the deep end of regecting all the bullshit European catholics were into that they created a whole brand new wave of bullshit. They also lacked a centralized system of theological thought so it was just loners reading the bible then telling other people what it said with no real oversight. Same way those grass roots movements of today get infected with a bunch of psychos because they have no authority to govern what is canon (Accepted thought). ",

    "body": "Wall of text alert: \n\nThere are hundreds of variations of this, but essentially we had two tanks, both filled with 50 long wing and 50 short wing fruit flies. That's a genetic thing, dominant is long wing, recessive is short wing (I think? Someone correct me if it's the opposite). Both tanks were fed the same dish of liquid sugar every so often (we had to switch off feeding duty every few days) . One tank was the control, and we let it progress naturally over 10 weeks i believe. The other tank had a sticky paper at the top to act as an artificial predator - only the long wing flies could fly up that high and potentially get stuck and die. We recorded results over 6 generations of flies in those 2 weeks, and by the end the control tank was about 2/3 long wing 1/3 short wing, but the other was almost 75% short wing. This shows that in a controlled ecosystem, the long wing flies are more likely to survive. When a predator is introduced that favors long wing flies, less of them reproduce. That's called natural selection. This causes more short wing flies to reproduce with that recessive gene over time, and across 6 generations we calculated it was a statistically improbable difference that there was no change (the p-value was so close to 0 we couldn't calculate one). This is again just one variation of this test, as it has been done time and time again especially in academic settings so students can watch evolution happen right in front of them. Evolution is, again, defined as genetic variation within a population across generations. This is a provable concept, and we did it in an undergrad science lab - nothing fancy or elitist about it. People often confuse this with the concept of abiogenesis, the idea that life arose from the constant reconfiguration of nonliving matter - basically amino acids came together and rearranged themselves an infinite number of times until it clicked and we have life. Abiogenesis is the direct opposite theory of creationism, while evolution exists outside of that debate. Evolution happens every time a family has children - certain traits are favored and others disappear. \n\nSauce: Environmental Studies masters degree",
