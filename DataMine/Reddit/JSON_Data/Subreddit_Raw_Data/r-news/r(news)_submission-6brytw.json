It happened before with the appointing of Neil Gorsuch. It could take years to conclude, since it will be very thorough. People argue that the investigation and proceeding process along with it will be the punishment.\n\nThis is an absolute mess and it needs to be cleared up, if he is guilty then he needs to be brought to justice, if he is innocent then the people need to know to clear his name. I think the best way to get people on the right to support this is if people on the left agree not to use the investigation itself as evidence of guilt.\n\nAlthough I wouldn't put much hope in this being resolved civilly. When Hillary's emails were under investigation it was the exact same thing. Hillary fans were outraged by how political the investigatiom seemed and said it hurt Hillary's campaign. Even when it was finished and the FBI reccomended no charges, the right was still outraged by this. Even if Trump is found completely innocent of dealings with Russia I doubt the left will be satisfied.\n\nI'm not worried about our politicians as much as I am worried about the average person. Everyone is at each other's throat and having differing political positions is seen as some deep moral transgression. We can't even agree that a neutral party should investigate potential wrong doing with our president. It's very sad and scary, and I have no idea what to do about it.",

But I'm saying that if it is getting that abstract, and that coded, that we are doing away with the racial problem one way or the other. You follow me \u2014 because obviously sitting around saying, \"We want to cut this,\" is much more abstract than even the busing thing, and a hell of a lot more abstract than \"n----r, n----r.\"\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_strategy\n\n>Ailes repackaged Richard Nixon for television in 1968, papered over Ronald Reagan\u2019s budding Alzheimer\u2019s in 1984, shamelessly stoked racial fears to elect George H.W. Bush in 1988, and waged a secret campaign on behalf of Big Tobacco to derail health care reform in 1993. \"He was the premier guy in the business,\" says former Reagan campaign manager Ed Rollins. \"He was our Michelangelo.\"\n>\n>Over the next decade, drawing on the tactics he honed working for Nixon, he helped elect two more conservative presidents, Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush. At the time, Reagan was beginning to exhibit what his son Ron now describes as early signs of Alzheimer\u2019s, and his age and acuity were becoming a central issue in the campaign.\n>\n>In 1974, his notoriety from the Nixon campaign won him a job at Television News Incorporated, a new right-wing TV network that had launched under a deliberately misleading motto that Ailes would one day adopt as his own: \"fair and balanced.\" The project of archconservative brewing magnate Joseph Coors, the news service was designed to inject a far-right slant into local news broadcasts by providing news clips that stations could use without credit \u2013 and for a fraction of the true costs of production. Once the affiliates got hooked on the discounted clips, its president explained, TVN would \"gradually, subtly, slowly\" inject \"our philosophy in the news.\u201d The network was, in the words of a news director who quit in protest, a \"propaganda machine.\"\n>\n>But in 1993 \u2013 the year after he claimed he had retired from corporate consulting \u2013 Ailes inked a secret deal with tobacco giants Philip Morris and RJ Reynolds to go full-force after the Clinton administration on its central policy objective: health care reform.\n>\n>Hillarycare was to have been funded, in part, by a $1-a-pack tax on cigarettes. To block the proposal, Big Tobacco paid Ailes to produce ads highlighting \u201creal people affected by taxes.\u201d\n>\n>According to internal memos, Ailes also explored how Philip Morris could create a phony front group called the \u201cCoalition for Fair Funding of Health Care\u201d to deploy the same kind of \u201cindependent\u201d ads that produced Willie Horton. In a precursor to the modern Tea Party, Ailes conspired with the tobacco companies to unleash angry phone calls on Congress \u2013 cold-calling smokers and patching them through to the switchboards on Capitol Hill \u2013 and to gin up the appearance of a grassroots uprising, busing 17,000 tobacco employees to the White House for a mass demonstration. \u201cRJR has trained 200 people to call in to shows,\u201d a March 1993 memo revealed. \u201cA packet has gone to Limbaugh. We need to brief Ailes.\"\n\nhttp://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/how-roger-ailes-built-the-fox-news-fear-factory-20110525\n\n>A memo entitled \u201cA Plan for Putting the GOP on TV News,\u201d buried in the the Nixon library details a plan between Ailes and the White House to bring pro-administration stories to television networks around the country. It reads: \u201cPeople are lazy. With television you just sit\u2014watch\u2014listen. The thinking is done for you.\u201d\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/blogpost/post/richard-nixon-and-roger-ailes-1970s-plan-to-put-the-gop-on-tv/2011/07/01/AG1W7XtH_blog.html\n\nFox News' billionaire owner is Australian media mogul Rupert Murdoch, who has a media empire there [biased to Australia's wealthy/conservative political party](http://cf.broadsheet.ie/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/MurdochpapersOz.jpg), and an even larger empire in the UK, including Sky TV (UK's largest) and all of his News Corp tabloids, which did all of the same fearmongering tactics with Brexit: https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jun/24/mail-sun-uk-brexit-newspapers\n\nBillionaire Robert Mercer, who backs Breitbart: http://www.npr.org/2017/05/26/530181660/robert-mercer-is-a-force-to-be-reckoned-with-in-finance-and-conservative-politic\n\n>Among other things, Mercer said the United States went in the wrong direction after the 1964 Civil Rights Act, and also insisted the only remaining racists in the United States were African-Americans, according to Magerman. Among the theories that Robinson has propounded and that Bob Mercer has accepted is that climate change is not happening. It's not for real, and if it is happening, it's going to be good for the planet. That's one of his theories, and the other theory that I found particularly worrisome was they believe that nuclear war is really not such a big deal. And they've actually argued that outside of the immediate blast zone in Japan during World War II - outside of Hiroshima and Nagasaki - that the radiation was actually good for the Japanese. So they see a kind of a silver lining in nuclear war and nuclear accidents.\n\nJohn Oliver summarizing another, Sinclair Broadcast Group: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvtNyOzGogc\n\nAnother billionaire, but with Reddit: http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/09/22/palmer-luckey-the-facebook-billionaire-secretly-funding-trump-s-meme-machine.html\n\n>\u201cWe conquered Reddit and drive narrative on social media, conquered the [mainstream media], now it\u2019s time to get our most delicious memes in front of Americans whether they like it or not,\u201d a representative for the group wrote in an introductory post on Reddit.\n>\n>\u201cI\u2019ve got plenty of money,\u201d Luckey added. \u201cMoney is not my issue.

For example **all** Atlantic flights inbound to the **USA** were instead diverted to Canada and most flights ended up on the East coast which is the poorest and most isolated part of the country. But all 250 planes and 45,000 people were diverted and the USA was completely shielded from these atlantic origin flights:\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Yellow_Ribbon\n\nThis was a **very big deal** because Canada also closed its airspace because of the immediate threat, but instead of forcing these US bound flights to fly to the USA and create a potential danger for America, Canadians instead coordinated a big effort diverting and landing all these planes and providing humanitarian aid to the suspended passengers.\n\nThat day was frightening for me because my uncle is a pilot and it was the first time I saw my dad cry because we didn't know his schedule and were worried. My airport is very small and there were so many planes that they [parked them on the runways](https://i.cbc.ca/1.3223833.1473529798!/fileImage/httpImage/image.png_gen/derivatives/original_300/halifax-9-11-airport.png). It's known as \"the day the planes stayed still\".\n\nOur airports were all like little villages for an entire week, and it was up to the locals to help take care of the US bound passengers. [Most notably is probably Gander](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXbxoy4Mges), a small isolated town that landed so many planes that it doubled or tripled the towns population.\n\nThe threat of further attacks against the Americans was so severe and urgent that at one point a plane was escorted to land in Canada by both Canadian and American fighter jets, and the plane was then evacuated at gunpoint by the RCMP in Canada:\n\n> One of the intercepted flights was Korean Air Flight 85 destined for John F. Kennedy International Airport with a stopover in Anchorage, Alaska, that was believed to have been hijacked. Concerns about the plane being crashed into Anchorage led several buildings in the city to be evacuated. Several buildings were also evacuated in Whitehorse as a precaution.[10] The flight ended up running low on fuel, and according to a public affairs official at the airport, there was also a communication problem with the air crew.[11] When it landed at the airport, witnesses reported that the RCMP ordered the crew out of the plane at gunpoint.[9] The entire incident was a misunderstanding caused by a malfunctioning transponder.",

As such, he has the right to appoint a special prosecutor...someone outside of the Executive Branch chain of command. So Rosenstein did that. \n\nGoing to nitpick a little bit here. Andrew McCabe is currently the acting Director of the FBI. Rosenstein assumed no new authority over the FBI than he had before. It's just that Rosenstein is the Deputy Attorney General. As such, he has always held the power to appoint a special prosecutor (As has the Attorney General). Special Prosecutors do not come from the FBI, they are produced by the Attorney General's office. Traditionally, they can only be fired by the Attorney General, as well. It was the promise of the AGs of Nixon to Congress not to fire Archibald Cox that caused them to have to resign as AG when Nixon ultimately asked them to anyways in the Saturday Night Massacre.\n\nIn theory, there is nothing legally stopping Trump from firing Rosenstein, just as Nixon did, and ~~nothing stopping Sessions from firing Meuller directly, as well, to the best of my knowledge (Which may be wrong, but please provide a source if I am!)~~ Sessions can't do this, since he recused himself from the Russian Investigation in his AG confirmation hearings.",

    "body": "Although less detailed, I can add a military perspective to this, too. I was still in elementary school at the time, but my school was on the air force base in Cold Lake, Alberta, which is (was? I'm out of date) one of the larger air force bases in Canada at the time. The base we talked into lockdown, the military police officer who was supposed to come teach us DARE (and was also the teacher's husband) didn't make it, and every kid in my class had at least one parent that could now be called on to act. Both of my parents were majors at the time. There were jets ready and waiting for the order to fly if that was deemed necessary and even when that didn't end up happening, the base was on alert for basically the rest of my time living there. So, in addition to the awesomeness of some of our local citizens in hosting civilians that were grounded and stranded by this, Canadians in the military were also directly affected by the knowledge that an attack on the US meant something for them, too, in the near future. Although or air force was not immediately called to do anything big on 9/11 itself, considering that both of my parents served terms in Afghanistan in the following years, that was definitely true.
