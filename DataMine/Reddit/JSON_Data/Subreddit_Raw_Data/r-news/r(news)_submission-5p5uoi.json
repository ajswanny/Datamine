It's more a blanket changing of administrations type deal. Basically, they treat the WhiteHouse.gov site more like a blog than like a website. Which is strange, but whatever.\n\nMost of the content that was produced during Obama's administration was moved to ObamaWhiteHouse.gov. You can find all of the LGBT and climate change sections still there.\n\nPeople are acting like Trump selectively removed certain pages that didn't match his policy--from my understanding, that's not the case. Trump didn't decide to remove a, b, and c, but not x, y, and z. His administration is going to be responsible for completely repopulating the site with all information they feel is relevant, from square one. The site is almost totally barren in *every* way right now, not just when it comes to LGBT and climate change. This strikes me very much as more an administrative fuck up than an intentional removal of certain pages and keywords. If you look at WhiteHouse.gov, it's not just those sections missing. It's almost *everything* that Obama's administration put up. And that's all over at Obama's WhiteHouse.gov page now.\n\nI'm not sure this will get seen, but people should research things like this a little more before jumping to conclusions. Snopes has a pretty extensive article up already, I recommend it if you're concerned. I linked it at the top of my post. I don't love the specific content of the pages that Trump *has* posted, but just keep in mind that omitted content doesn't mean it's been completely purged from Trump's policy. It just means their interns haven't gotten to re-writing that page for Trump's WhiteHouse.gov yet.",

This is a bit of sensationalism. \n\nEdit: Check out this [Snope's Article](http://www.snopes.com/white-house-web-site-trump-changes/)\n\nEdit2: Everyone, please put down the pitchforks. **I am concerned about Trump's stance on climate change** just like many of you. *However* I also rely on honest, impartial news sources that deliver the news without sensationalism.  \n\nThe *only* point I am making, is that the title of this article is designed to play on people's expectations of Trump in order to get page views. That is bad journalism. A more appropriate title of this article would be something like \"Trumps' WhiteHouse.gov does not include any information about climate change.\"\n\nEdit3: let me elaborate on what likely happened. Think of building a website as drawing a picture. Obama has his picture done with all the details he wants to include, all the things that are important to him. For the past 8 years it's been hanging on the nation's fridge for everyone to see. \n\nWell over the past few months trump has been working on his own. However, it's not like he took an eraser to Obama's, taking away the stuff he didn't like and then drawing his over it. It's more like he got out a totally new piece of paper and started drawing. He's including all the stuff that is important to him, just as Obama included what was important to him. \n\nThen at noon today we, the nation, hung Trumps drawing on the fridge instead of Obama's. \n\nEdit4: thank you for the gold, random reddittors.

The study employed objective questions, such as whether Hosni Mubarak was still in power in Egypt.[78][79][80]\n>\n>    67% of Fox viewers believed that the \"U.S. has found clear evidence in Iraq that Saddam Hussein was working closely with the al Qaeda terrorist organization\" (compared with 56% for CBS, 49% for NBC, 48% for CNN, 45% for ABC, 16% for NPR/PBS).\n>\n>    The belief that \"The U.S. has found Weapons of Mass Destruction in Iraq\" was held by 33% of Fox viewers and only 23% of CBS viewers, 19% for ABC, 20% for NBC, 20% for CNN and 11% for NPR/PBS.\n>\n>    35% of Fox viewers believed that \"the majority of people [in the world] favor the U.S. having gone to war\" with Iraq (compared with 28% for CBS, 27% for ABC, 24% for CNN, 20% for NBC, 5% for NPR/PBS).\n\n>Daily memos\n>\n>Photocopied memos from John Moody instructed the network's on-air anchors and reporters to use positive language when discussing pro-life viewpoints, the Iraq War, and tax cuts, as well as requesting that the Abu Ghraib prisoner abuse scandal be put in context with the other violence in the area.[84] Such memos were reproduced for the film Outfoxed, which included Moody quotes such as, \"The soldiers [seen on Fox in Iraq] in the foreground should be identified as 'sharpshooters,' not 'snipers,' which carries a negative connotation.\"\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News_Channel_controversies#Internal_memos_and_e-mail\n\nFox News' co-founder worked on these strategies for decades, **including on the (infamously racist) Republican \"Southern Strategy\" and with Nixon**: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_strategy#Evolution_.281970s_and_1980s.29 (Atwater's quote in this Wikipedia article about their race-baiting plans/blueprint is incredibly damning/brilliant)\n\nExamples of the biased charts and graphics Fox News uses on its shows: http://mediamatters.org/research/2012/10/01/a-history-of-dishonest-fox-charts/190225\n\nFox News' tactics on Reddit itself: http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/09/22/palmer-luckey-the-facebook-billionaire-secretly-funding-trump-s-meme-machine.html\n\nEven Superman warned about these tactics in a PSA: http://www.snopes.com/superman-1950-poster-diversity/",

He rejects scientific evidence of global warming or any contribution to it by burning fossil fuels.\n\n>Murray supported Trump and says Trump can bring back coal jobs if he takes several steps: end the emissions regulations, withdraw from the U.N. climate change agreement \u2014 which Murray says \"basically is an attempt by developing countries to get American money\" \u2014 and end subsidies for windmills, solar panels and other forms of renewable energy.\n\n\n>Bob Murray is president and CEO of Murray Energy, in St. Clairsville, Ohio. Though he is a strenuous advocate for measures to bolster the coal industry, he says he cautioned Donald Trump to \"temper his statements about bringing the miners back to work.\"\nMurray Energy Corp.\nMurray took the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to court to block clean air regulations and won a stay. He says that Trump should name a Supreme Court justice who will block presidential excesses and should fire Justice Department lawyers whom he describes as criminals. And that's not all.\n\n>\"He needs to eliminate one-half of the employees in the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. He needs to cut the staff drastically in the Department of Interior. He needs to eliminate the Department of Energy altogether,\" Murray says.\n\n>He thinks much of this can be done in a matter of two or three months. And if that happens, Murray says he can have a couple of thousand people back at work by spring at his now idle mines.\n\n>But even Murray, the crusader against the so-called war on coal, concedes this: So many coal-fired plants have shut down that the promise of more coal mining jobs will be hard to keep.\n\n>\"I've told Mr. Trump to caution and temper his statements about bringing the miners back to work,\" Murray says.",

During the economic collapse it wasn't poor people that lost the most money, it was the wealthy. And of the average citizens that were indirectly bailed out via their foreclosures, they tended to be citizens who were at least middle class and owned houses. \n\nBut the statistic you provided shows the states which consume the most federal tax dollars compared to the amount they contribute. This is obviously a totally different argument. The states that have a lot of poor people will obviously be the ones that need the most assistance, but those poor people are the Americans least likely to own houses. They usually rent. \n\nTo add to the inaccuracy of your post, it should be pointed out that the poorest Americans strongly lean Democrat. So the people that are dragging down the averages of even \"Republican\" states tend to be poor Democrats. \n\nhttp://assets.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/legacy/517-24.gif\n\n",

For example [Afghanistan](http://web.archive.org/web/20090430015954/http://www.whitehouse.gov/issues/foreign_policy/) got a mention, even though it was basically \"we're not focusing on Afghanistan anymore\".

It's unlikely that we sterilize the entire planet.\n\nEdit: I'm not saying that this is OK, or that our current course is OK, or anything like that. I'm just pointing out that life as a whole is like a clingy girlfriend. \n\nThere's life in the bottoms of the oceans. There's life [floating around in the high areas of the troposhpere](http://www.nature.com/news/high-flying-bacteria-spark-interest-in-possible-climate-effects-1.12310). There's life in frozen, salty AF Antarctic lakes. Life exists [.75 miles under the ocean crust](http://www.livescience.com/29857-microbes-discovered-in-earths-crust.html). We find extremophiles [in the freezing cold](http://www.oneworldoneocean.com/blog/entry/psychrophiles-microbes-that-like-it-cold), scorching heat, and some bacteria can survive [intense radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deinococcus_radiodurans). \n\nThere's animals and plants all over the world that are teaching us things that we were never expecting, like [gecko-skin adhesives](https://geckskin.umass.edu/) and passive cooling systems such as those being used by termites are seeing some application in buildings like [this one](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastgate_Centre,_Harare). Plants are still stunning us with their structures and forms, allowing us to mimic them to develop new tech including [waterproofing coatings](http://www.treehugger.com/clean-technology/plant-eggbeater-shaped-hairs-inspires-new-waterproof-coating.html). Of course this has nothing to say of the smorgasbord of novel chemical compounds, proteins, etc. discovered in plants, animals, and the rest of all the life on Earth every day. \n\nWhat I was trying to say was that due to life's incredible diversity we probably wouldn't be able to exterminate it, not by nuking, and by probably very little short of [glassing](https://www.halopedia.org/Glassing) the planet (and even that might not be enough). I'm not saying this was an acceptable outcome in the slightest-we still have too much to learn from the life around us to say nothing of the moral and ethical implications of killing the majority of life on the planet, of course overlooking the fact that we as the human race suffer greatly from causing a mass extinction event, whether it is instant or the slow (to human timescales) extinction that we see here.\n\nTL;DR: It makes little moral, ethical, (long-term) economic, intellectual, or any sort of other sense to be OK with this sort of course. My comment meant to simply mention the incredible adaptability of life (in general, not some specific species or environmental status quo).\n",

That could mean a difference of $100 to $500 more on your monthly mortgage payment. In about 2012, 2013? Obama had it reduced to .85%. Mortgage companies saw a huge influx of loans as people refinanced to take advantage of lowering their monthly mortgage payment. He had just rolled out another reduction and Trump halted it for no reason other than Obama had done it. It has no affect on the market, your home's equity, or HUD, it's just insurance for them and would have meant more money every month in the homebuyer's pocket.

Such a policy can be set out expressly in a law (de jure) or observed only in practice (de facto). The term applies generally to cities that do not use municipal funds or resources to enforce national immigration laws, and usually forbid police or municipal employees to inquire about a person's immigration status. The designation has no precise legal meaning.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanctuary_city\n\nICE is Immigrations and Customs Enforcement.\n\nBeyond the larger immigration arguments, most cities that adopt it have the position that in order to prevent crime in the city and abuse of the undocumented, undocumented immigrants must not fear police. Under normal circumstances, a undocumented person who witnesses a murder would risk deportation to come forward, or someone who's in a abusive situation might choose to remain rather than risk deportation. Some folks are lured here under the promise of a better life and then sold into sex slavery, punishing them for coming forward can allow these criminal gangs to continue because they won't risk deportation.\n",
