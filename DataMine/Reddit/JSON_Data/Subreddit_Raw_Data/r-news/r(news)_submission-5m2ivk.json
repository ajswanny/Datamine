We don't want to lock the post, so please help us out by following our comment rules:\n\n* **No private/personal information.** Information like that can only be posted in the comments once it has been made public by law enforcement or through major news outlets.\n\n* **Do not engage in calls for violence.** If you make threats, wish death, or allude to acts of violence, we will ban you.\n\n* Please keep your comments civil. While this is certainly an outrageous story that has obvious racial components, **racism will not be tolerated.** This goes both ways (aka black on white, white on black).\n\n* Make sure to give other users warning about any graphic video you may choose to post by tagging it nsfw.\n\nLastly, **please report any rule-violating comments.** There are a lot of comments and we can't possibly review every single one of them.\n\nThanks!",

    "body": "I don't think any of this constitutes PII since I'm not identifying any of the people involved and only referencing deceased folks. \n\nThese appear to be former members and/or affiliates  of a renegade Gangster Disciple set in Chicago called PBG (named after their friend Pooh Bear, who was murdered when he was 15), also known as Pappy Gang (the set earned a new nickname after their other friend, Young Pappy, was finally killed on the third attempt to assassinate him, at age 19). You can hear them mention PBG and Pappy Gang in the video they streamed. \n\nI'm pretty sure they made the victim yell \"Fuck Munchie\" at one point near the end. That's one of the dead gang members of an enemy gang (Loyalty Over Cash IIRC.. Munchie was killed at age 19, I think, and was rumored to have killed or ordered the hit on Pooh Bear. Pappy, in turn, claimed to have had a part in killing Munchie before he was himself killed. And so the cycle continues..)\n\n(One of the accused in the video is an aspiring drill rapper who I won't name due to fear of misidentification and out of respect for the rules.)\n\n**Nothing can ever explain or excuse what they did to this poor young man.**\n\nBeating him, making him drink toilet water, cutting him with a knife, slapping him, repeatedly saying they'd kill him, etc, all while forcing him to repeatedly denounce Trump and carrying on with racist screeds. \n\nIt's interesting to note that at least some of the people in this video deal with violence and death _constantly_, and have done so from an early age. When people say there is a _cultural_ problem of violence and a moral vacuum in some inner cities, this is what they are talking about. \n\nThe casual way they engage in their evil and violence is shocking enough. But the laughter, all along assuming that anyone who saw the video would be impressed (their own gang) or terrorized (their enemies) is just unbearable to witness. .\n\nJust so sad to see this happening in our nation. \n\nThey held this poor fellow for 24-48 hours, and it's reported one of them was his classmate. How terrifying for him, and such betrayal from someone he thought he knew. He is reportedly mentally ill as well Just tears in my eyes. \n\nThis is never going to stop until we realize that _most_ people, of all races, colors and creeds, just want to live their lives and get along. \n\n*Endlessly dividing us through identity politics and dehumanizing \"the enemy\" doesn't solve anything. Please, please stop it.*\n\n**THE WAGES OF IDENTITY POLITICS IS HATE.**\n\n----\n\nEdit: \n\nI should be really clear about this in this post (as I've explained elsewhere). I don't know what life was like for the four perpetrators featured in the video. Given what I know about PBG and at least one of the individuals, I do feel confident saying that they were probably surrounded by violence and violent role models for a long time now.\n\nBut they are adults. They have free will. They are responsible for their decisions and the evil they commit. \n\nMy point is that the _cultural_ problems aren't going to go away on their own. There are thousands of other children and teens in our nation who, tonight, will walk the streets selling drugs, watching the shadows for enemies, desperately thinking about whether there is any hope or future for them at all. \n\nReductive \"solutions\" like \"gun control\", \"get tough on crime\", etc, aren't likely to fix a problem whose root is at least partially cultural and economic. \n\nAnd things like \"blame institutional racism\" actually make the situation far, far, worse, IMO. \n\nWe need to be willing to stare into the face of evil and find out why it manifests in this way, sometimes just a few blocks away from relatively \"normal\" areas.

Or what if they girl basically lured him in making him think she was interested would he try to make sure she doesn't get into trouble. I worked with high functioning mentally disabled kids, they all want to be liked or loved. If they consider you are friend they will try to make sure you are safe. They don't understand what has mentally occurred because they just want to be liked or loved. \n\nUghh this breaks my heart. Sick ppl ughh",

In China, they found a way to blame all their troubles on the intellectuals and the landowners, so those people were executed while the citizens watched and cheered like they would a sporting event.\n\nTo allow continual attribution of the problems faced by african americans to a monolithic and domineering \"white system\" is just begging for this kind of mentality to sprout. And it's far more common than people are willing to admit. Racism hasn't gone away, but the institutions and systems that make up our country are about as fair as any society has ever been.
