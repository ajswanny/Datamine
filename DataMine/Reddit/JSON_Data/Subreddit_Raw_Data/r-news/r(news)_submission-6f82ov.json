I see a bunch of people saying 'how are the UK police supposed to take out an armed suspect/terrorist/junkie etc who is wielding a gun, if they only have batons?'\n\nThe thing you have to realise in the UK, these armed suspects are not armed the way you might expect in other countries. While knife crime is a problem, I've never once walked down any street in the UK and been worried that a guy might be carrying a gun. It just isn't a thing here. Of course there are circumstances where a criminal somehow gets access to a firearm, but the likelihood of that goes way, way, way down if the police aren't carrying guns in the first place.\n\nEveryone in the UK is wary. We know there are occasions (like this one) where police\u200b carrying a gun might have helped save a few lives. But on balance every police officer carrying a gun every day would mean far higher gun deaths. There is logic to it. They didn't just all watch the end of The Last Samurai and decide that honorable death was better than upgrading police fire power.\n\nIt's easy to calculate how many incidents a year would be been aided by police carrying a gun. But it's very difficult to fully see out the hypothetical of how many problems or needless deaths would occur in the future by giving every police officer a gun.\n\nEDIT: Words. But also wow, thanks all, I appreciate the support for these humble opinions and the interesting discussion it's generated on both sides of the debate.",

    "body": "For those wondering, our police don't routinely carry guns principally because of the principle that police in the UK 'police by consent'. That is, the power of the police stems from the public and not the state; they are members of the community and police through cooperation with the public. There are a number of historical reasons for this but it primarily arose because of the fear that the police could then be used to suppress protest or to support an oppressive government.\n\nPolice officers are allowed to use 'reasonable force' in executing an arrest, therefore the use of firearms can be ordered by an officer of rank Inspector or higher. For example, while gun crime is relatively rare in the UK, the use of firearms in a situation when a gun crime is reported is obviously appropriate.\n\nArmed officers are routinely posted at key areas including airports, train stations and government buildings such as parliament so don't be surprised if you see this if you visit the UK. In addition, armed response teams can deployed, such as those seen in the response to the attacks on Saturday.",

He was given the number 11 in the small team responsible for protecting members of the\u00a0Royal Family. On 20 March 1974 the princess and her husband Captain\u00a0Mark Phillips\u00a0were returning to\u00a0Buckingham Palace\u00a0from a royal engagement. Their car was stopped in the Mall by another vehicle driven into its path.[3]\u00a0The car was driven by Ian Ball, who was later declared to be mentally ill; Ball jumped out of his vehicle and tried to force the Princess from her car. He shot the royal chauffeur, Alex Callender, and a passing journalist, Brian McConnell, who tried to assist. Inspector Beaton was shot three times, including serious wounds in the chest and abdomen, and a gunshot wound to his hand, sustained when he tried to block Ball's weapon with his own body, after his own gun had jammed. Beaton also sustained injuries to his pelvis while trying to disarm Ball.[4][5]\u00a0For his bravery Beaton was awarded the\u00a0George Cross",

Search twitter for \"london\" provided a few tweets about an incident at london bridge, it was only by about 2230 that I realised it was an attack, and spent the next 1-2 hours worrying if the attackers were still on the loose.\n\nIt's crazy to think it was over (although that might not have been known to anyone at the time, hindsight is wonderful), before anyone outside the area knew it was happening. It makes me think that if the information came a lot faster from the police (such as when they've shot someone), the general terror these attacks create might not be so big. I mean the response (and the response time) is outstanding from the emergency services, but maybe now it's time to work on speeding up the flow of [accurate] information.",

Ball then directed Anne to get out of the car, to which she replied: \"Not bloody likely!\", and reportedly briefly considered hitting Ball. Eventually, she exited the other side of the limousine as had her lady-in-waiting, Rowena Brassey. A passing pedestrian, a former boxer named Ron Russell, punched Ball in the back of the head and then led Anne away from the scene. At that point, Police Constable Michael Hills happened upon the situation; he too was shot by Ball, but not before he called for police backup. Detective Constable Peter Edmonds, who had been nearby, answered and gave chase, finally arresting Ball.\n\nSo it sounds like saving her was a group effort, to say the least!",

The priority should be dealing with the emergent threat, not what to put in the press release.\n\n2. It was over so quickly that any information released would not be known by most people in the vicinity until after the situation was controlled.\n\n3.
