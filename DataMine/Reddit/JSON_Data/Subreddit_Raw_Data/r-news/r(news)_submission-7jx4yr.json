If the goal is to contact a senator, send a letter to the editor to a few of the 5-10 biggest newspapers in your state. If you're trying to contact a representative, send it to any newspapers within your district. In either case, make sure to mention the legislator you're trying to reach by name, preferably in the title. You should also look up the submission requirements for any newspapers you'd like to try to get to publish your letter.\n\nWhy the letter to the editor? Legislators are more likely to be influenced by a letter if they have reason to believe it could influence the opinions of their constituents, whose support they'll need to be re-elected.\n\nFrom what I can tell from having worked in a senator's office for a summer, they almost never will read a letter or an email you send them directly. A staffer will do that, and if enough letters on a given subject come in, that staffer will draft a form letter response to send back to constituents.\n\nBut, in the office in which I worked, any letter to the editor that mentioned my senator by name and appeared in one of the 5-10 biggest newspapers in the state was included in a document that he read first thing every morning. I was often tasked with organizing and printing off copies of the document. I printed off the documents in the basement, where interns from a number of other senate offices were doing essentially the same thing that I did. So I know that practice was not exclusive to our office.\n\n**TL;DR:**\n\nCall your legislators, because that's the easiest and least time-intensive tactic available.  Send them emails and letters at well.  Those tactics are useful. \n\nBut if you have the time, you should consider writing a letter to the editor and trying to get it published in a newspaper. That's far more effective. Legislators want to get re-elected, so they care what their constituents are reading about them.",

That's because our culture has adopted it as so but out culture has also lived without it once. I think because how engrained it is in our society gives power for us to be abused by it. By saying give it up for a week to not allow a select few control our culture doesn't discount how people's wellbeing relies on it. Wouldn't that be a good opportunity to evaluate our values and see how current actions are contributing to that or not? If you loose your source of income because you and others made a stand, does that hurt your values? If you keep Internet and show private interest you are able to be conditioned by them and give them more money, does that hurt you values? If you really value having a job or your current way of life the same then you need to do the actions that correspond with that. But if something is going on that makes you think society at its core is fucking up then there's probably going to be some unpleasant actions to be taken to even just address it. I am being dramatic now and going off of limited knowledge/experiences but I believe that the issues against net neutrality are similar to that of social movements/civil rights. The nature of those movements really question how our everyday contributes to the system we disagree with and from ones I've seen, they had to deal with a lot of lifestyle shakeup to achieve their results.",

In addition,  most content today is hosted geographically redundant with Content Delivery Networks,  general cloud computing,  etc. Bottom line is that it will be unpredictable,  but most likely I would only notice if interacting only with data hosted in the US.
