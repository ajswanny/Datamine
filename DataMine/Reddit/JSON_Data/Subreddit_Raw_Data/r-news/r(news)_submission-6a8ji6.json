CNN learned of the subpoenas hours before President Donald Trump fired FBI director James Comey.\nThe subpoenas represent the first sign of a significant escalation of activity in the FBI's broader investigation begun last July into possible ties between Trump campaign associates and Russia.\nThe subpoenas issued in recent weeks by the US Attorney's Office in Alexandria, Virginia, were received by associates who worked with Flynn on contracts after he was forced out as director of the Defense Intelligence Agency in 2014, according to the people familiar with the investigation.",

According to the Succession Act of 1947, the Speaker of the House is in line to become President after the Vice President\u2014true.  However, there are strong arguments that the Succession Act is unconstitutional.  It all hinges on the definition of the word \"officer.\"  In the Constitution, \"Officer\" is a term of art that most plausibly should be interpreted as an \"Officer of the United States,\" which in and of itself is a specific term with a very specific meaning.  What's pertinent is that the Speaker of the House is not, under this definition, an Officer of the United States.  \n\nIf it ever came down to it, and the Speaker was actually going to become President, it's almost guaranteed that the opposing party would file suit in the SCOTUS, and there's a strong case to be made that the SCOTUS should strike that language from the Act.  \n\nFor a more detailed background, see [this](http://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1959&context=fss_papers) article in the *Stanford Law Review*.  \n\nEDIT: Someone made a good point below that whether the opposing party would file suit is more a function of whether it'd be politically expedient.  I.e. maybe they'd prefer the Speaker to be the President over the officer next in line.  I agree with this.  \n\nEDIT2: Someone else made a good point that other parties aside from the opposing political party might have standing to challenge the Succession Act.  Sounds like a plausible scenario.  ",

First, ranked choice voting for primaries in the state. Then, ranked choice voting for national primaries.\n\nThis is something that I think can snowball quite easily, because it's obviously a good idea. As soon as one state does it, then it will get lots of press coverage talking about what it is and why they did it. Then, when the rest of country realizes what it is, they'll all push for it as well.\n\nMake the changes that you can on the local level. If they're good changes, they'll gain traction and start a movement. I think the Green Party is the worst in this case. They only ever campaign for the presidency, which is basically impossible for them to win. They should take all of their funds and use them to campaign for Green Party mayors, governors, senators, and congressmen, and then, only once they have multiple Green Party officials at all levels of government, only then should they spend the money trying to run for president. In the US, there are over 7,300 Upper and Lower House state seats. They don't have a single one. Why even waste your time trying for the highest seat of all, when you can't even get 1/7000th of the state seats? I'd love to see them do better, but you need to start small to make changes.",
