This money goes to the [International Rescue Committe](https://www.rescue.org/what-we-do)\n\n[Charity Navigator gives them a score of 91.16/100](https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.summary&orgid=3898). Good pick Mr. Penn.\n\nEdit: Read /u/aleij's and /u/Acoconutting's comments below. They give a great perspective on what to look for in a charity and how the ratio of funds spent on projects should not be used on its own. I removed the reference to this metric leaving only the Charity Navigator score which is a more comprehensive measure of the quality of the charity.",

    "body": "Former nonprofit employee and department manager here! Always do your homework before donating, however, the outcome measure of money spent on admin versus programs is overall detrimental to the performance of a nonprofit. There's a move within the field to find new outcome measures that more closely reflect a non-profit's effectiveness, since money spent on programs does not necessarily capture that. For example, a non profit may be giving 92 cents on every dollar to a program, but that program could be giving away t-shirts or doing something else fairly useless for all we know. Also, that metric tends to make smaller nonprofits look bad and larger ones better, due to the effects of scaling up. It also discourages non profits from investing in their own people. Yes, no one at a nonprofit should be making an exorbitant salary, but if you can't pay competent, talented people a decent salary you are going to lose them to the private sector. And a nonprofit needs good people to be effective. \n\nAnyway, thanks for listening. Please continue donating to nonprofits; just keep in mind to use more than just the \"percent of money spent on programs\" metric to choose. Really look at them to see if they are fulfilling their nonprofit mission and making an actual difference in the lives of the people they serve. The BBB Charity review (give.org) has a good site that reviews 20 different metrics to recommend a nonprofit. \n\nOkay getting off the soapbox now. ",

    "body": "To Trump supporters, people with brown skin and names like \"Kal\" aren't real Americans.\n\nIt's pure racism.\n\nAnd I'm tired of being told that we can't call racism out and pretend it's \"economic anxiety\". Trump supporters represent the old backwards America that accepts racism and sees brown Muslim people as not belonging in America. We should openly call this out and resist it.\n\nSeeing Reddit turn so hard against Trump and become pro-refugee and pro-diversity gives me a lot of hope that they will be defeated. The next 4 years Reddit and Tumblr must work together to destroy Trump among millennials then we will come out and vote in a Democrat landslide. We all have to work on this, upvote as many anti-Trump posts as possible, shame and call out the Trumpets and make it uncool to associate with anything Trump related. \n\nIt's up to us to defeat this fascist government and bring back progressive social justice and tolerance for all. \n\nEdit: Trumpets are sending me hateful PMs calling me the n-word. How typical. ",

You could see it clearly on the town hall Bernie Sanders did with Trump voters in Wisconsin. 9/10 of them did not want to see anyone persecuted for their race or religion but they felt Hillary was the embodiment of the establishment and that the law would prevent anything this extreme from happening. Most racists probably support Trump but not all Trump voters are racist and that is why you are seeing such a large chunk of the online community and public in general turn against this.

The government *needs* to spy on everyone and basically lock down the borders and go full isolationist because those scary, non-American people might hurt us!  Maybe!  And, the news is being scary again with all those crime reports!  We need to do something, even if statistics say the crime rate is already plummeting - and that something we're going to do is lock down freedoms and rights even more, because life is scary and someone might hurt me.\n\nNow, maybe that sounds a little insulting towards people that hold that viewpoint.  And, it's meant to be a little because I see it as a viewpoint that's based in an irrational fear of the unknown, rather than a willingness to calm down and judge the situation rationally.  Freedom means that we sometimes need to bury our fears like that.  In my opinion, the price of freedom is that sometimes you'll have to let people do things you don't want them to do, or risk people abusing that freedom to harm others.  And while that might sound horrifying - \"I'm willing to risk harm so that I can do what I want\", I see it as rather the opposite - I would rather others have the freedom to live their lives to the fullest that they can given their abilities and whatnot, and not get caught up in a dragnet because of their socioeconomic background or the beliefs that they hold because of said pursuit.  Furthermore, as far as immigration goes - what made America great in the first place is that we're a melting pot of cultures.  That's the classic, rose-tinted glasses America - the one that anyone could come to from anywhere, and, with enough hard work and dedication, build the life they want to.  That's the America I want, and it's one that I'd be proud to live in.\n\nAnd hey, maybe it is a little selfish.  But I think a world where, so long as you don't hurt anyone you can do whatever you'd like is better than a world where you're constantly shit on because someone thinks you look like someone who maybe might conceivably hurt them.",
