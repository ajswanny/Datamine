    "body": "I got this from Marco Rubios office. I wonder what big business monies line his pockets. \n\n \nDear Mr. Ruppdogg78,\n \nThank you for taking the time to express your thoughts regarding the Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) internet regulations commonly referred to as \"net neutrality.\" Understanding your views helps me better represent Florida in the United States Senate, and I appreciate the opportunity to respond.\n \nSince its inception, the internet has flourished with minimal government involvement and has revolutionized our ability to communicate and conduct commerce. It provides businesses with the ability to compete in the global marketplace and is an engine of economic growth. Continued development of the internet and modern telecommunications, free of excessive and overly burdensome government regulations, is key to American innovation.\n \nOn February 26, 2015, the FCC voted 3-2 to reclassify broadband as a telecommunications utility under Title II of the Communications Act. The 332-page regulation was called \u201cnet neutrality,\u201d referencing the concept of preventing internet service providers (ISPs) from creating \u201cfast lanes\u201d and \u201cslow lanes\u201d for different content. This regulation effectively transferred power from ISPs to the federal government, and threatened to overregulate the Internet in a way that would make it more expensive for consumers, less innovative and less competitive. \n \nOn April 26, 2017, FCC Chairman Ajit Pai issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) to roll back the 2015 regulation. Chairman Pai is committed to an open and transparent process. As he explained, \u201ctwo years ago, the FCC hid the Title II Order from the American people until after it had been adopted. Only certain special interest groups were given special access able to make major changes to it. The FCC had to pass the 313-page Order before the public was allowed to see what was in it. The process over the coming months will be open and transparent with a nearly three month open comment period. You may agree or disagree with the proposal, but you\u2019ll be able to see exactly what it is.\u201d On May 18, 2017 the FCC voted to make the NPRM official. The comment period will stay open until August 16th, at which point the commission will issue a final decision. \n \nI believe modernizing the 1996 Communications Act should be a top priority for Congress, and would clarify the FCC's role in the modern communications landscape. Congress must create level regulatory playing field that protects consumers and encourages innovation.  \n \nIt is an honor and a privilege to serve you as your United States Senator. I will keep your thoughts in mind as I consider these issues and continue working to ensure America remains a safe and prosperous nation.\n \nSincerely,\n\nMarco Rubio\nUnited States Senator \nEach week I provide a weekly update on issues in Washington and ways in which my office can assist the people of Florida. Sign up here for updates on my legislative efforts, schedule of events throughout Florida, constituent services and much more.\n\n",

See our analysis from May (https://arstechnica.com/information-tec ... nt-system/) in which Cloudflare describes it as an Application Layer attack, which is a type of DDoS (though not the type most people are familiar with). This type of attack hits a specific application (the FCC comment system, in this case).\n\n>As for the claim about \"issu[ing] special keys,\" anyone can register for a free key. Pro- and anti-net neutrality groups both use the same system for submitting comments in bulk to the FCC. The FCC made the system incredibly open so anyone can comment (they don't even do CAPTCHA or NoCAPTCHA), which explains why it was so easy for any entity to flood the FCC with comments. (Whether the FCC made a good decision here is a different question.)\n\n>The question of whether what happened to the FCC comment system in May should be labeled a DDoS is a legitimate one, but based on what security experts and the FCC told us, it was either poorly written spam bots or an application layer DDoS attack.\n\n***\n\nAnother user `bing_crosby` succinctly put it:\n\n>Her entire post is conjecture, built around debunking the idea that the FCC was under attack from a traditional DDoS when everyone involved has repeatedly explained that it was not a traditional DDoS.\n\nSo the big post being spread around is totally wrong. Reddit latched on and blew it up like it does.",

What we have is a representative government and sadly our representatives have been acquiring more and more power while the middle class simultaneously loses theirs. Our country is built on lies, deceit, greed, immorality, and zero concern for the wellbeing of the majority. The long line of rich corporate-whore Presidents we've had has led to the system we have today that best serves the 1% while the average American carries the burden. That's why I'm always blown away at middle class working folks that vote for Republican nominees who have never been a member of the middle class and have never struggled financially. \n\nThe most recent President that actually grew up in a middle class household and could relate to us was Obama, but because FOX News instructed conservatives to hate Obama for the most mundane and unnecessary things, they fought against him tooth and nail to prevent him from actually making positive changes on our behalf. Republicans actively vote against their own best interests and the fact that they're unable to see this just shows how shockingly ignorant they are. \n\nEspecially those who voted for Trump, if you think Trump has any compassion for the middle class, you're retarded. He gained his fortune by screwing over middle class people and minorities, he's NEVER fought for our interests. All he knows is the lifestyle of wealth and fortune and is completely unable to relate to us in any way shape or form. And if he's unable to relate, how the fuck is he going to know what we need!? None of this matters to Republicans though, they just blindly support every rich white cock sucker the media parades in front of them, it matters not if they have a long record of supporting the wealthy over the average Joe. \n\nTo be fair though, the democratic party has itself turned into a playground of rich career politicians who are in the same corporate pockets as their conservative opposition. So in a nutshell, the only two choices we have are really no choice at all, and we're fucked no matter which candidate wins. Republicans however have traditionally been the biggest anti-middle class party.",

    "body": "\u00a0\n\nDear\u00a0[redacted]:\n\n\u00a0\n\nThank you for contacting me regarding Internet regulation and commerce. I appreciate having the benefit of your comments on this\u00a0matter.\n\n\u00a0\n\nOver the past two decades, Americans have increasingly relied on the Internet in their personal and professional lives, and new technologies\u00a0play\u00a0a central role in the Internet\u2019s\u00a0growing importance. Many of these technologies have been developed in Texas. As Texans and Americans, we all benefit from advancements that encourage economic growth and make day-to-day life easier.\n\n\u00a0\n\nWe need policies to meet the evolving challenges of technological advancement.\u00a0However,\u00a0government regulations move slower than technology, and we must\u00a0ensure\u00a0the laws we pass do not stifle innovation. A top-down regulatory approach can unnecessarily constrain an industry\u2019s ability to create and deliver new products and services to market. In the Senate, I have supported laws that facilitate innovation and opposed those\u00a0which\u00a0threaten it. For example, I supported the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act (P.L. 112-29), which modernized our outdated patent system by improving the application process and reducing litigation.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAs you may know, on May 18, 2017, the FCC voted 2-1 to pass the \u201cRestoring Internet Freedom\u201d Notice of Proposed Rule Making (NPRM). The NPRM intends to replace the regulatory structure of the 2015 Open Internet Order, commonly referred to as Net Neutrality, with a light-touch regulatory framework that protects consumers, closes the digital divide and brings next-generation networks and services to all Americans. The successful vote opened a two month comment period on how\u00a0to\u00a0best maintain a free and open Internet. If you wish to file your comments on the NPRM with the FCC, you may do so here:\u00a0https://www.fcc.gov/ecfs\u00a0. The deadline for submitting comments is July 17, 2017.\n\n\u00a0\n\nI support the FCC\u2019s transparent\u00a0approach to reduce\u00a0burdensome regulation and improve\u00a0internet access and services. I am also proud to cosponsor the Restoring Internet Freedom Act (S. 993). This legislation would nullify the net neutrality rule, ensure Congress maintains its primary authority to reshape communications policy, and restore the competitive freedom that has characterized the Internet. S.993 has been referred to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation. Although I am not a member of\u00a0this\u00a0Committee, I will be sure to keep your views in mind should S. 993 be considered by the full Senate during the 115th Congress.\n\n\u00a0\n\nI appreciate the opportunity to represent Texas in the United States Senate. Thank you for taking the time to contact me.\n\n\u00a0\n\nSincerely,\n\n\u00a0\n\nJOHN CORNYN\n\nUnited States Senator",

I assume it is still similar.\n\nWhen I fired up a VPN, sites came back alive.

Here's the response letter his office sent me after I contacted them:\n\n\n\nJuly 17, 2017\n \n \nDear Mr. Castleyankee\n \nThank you for contacting me regarding net neutrality.  It is good to hear from you.\n \nAs you may know, President Clinton and a Republican Congress passed the Telecommunications Act of 1996 to preserve free market competition on the Internet.  This bipartisan legislation recognized the importance of Internet competition for American consumers, workers, and businesses in a fast-paced, globalized economy.  As a result, the United States has the most successful and innovative Internet and technology companies in the world.  In 2015, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) narrowly voted to adopt \u201cnet neutrality\u201d regulations that restrict Internet Service Providers\u2019 (ISPs) ability to manage content.  The FCC argued that it had this authority under 1930s legislation designed to govern telegraph companies and nearly extinct telephone lines.\n \nOn May 18, 2017, the FCC proposed a rule to return to the Clinton administration\u2019s Internet regulatory framework.  The FCC will accept public comments on this proposed rule for 90 days and then vote on the rule.  In its proposal, the FCC cited the harmful impact of the 2015 regulations, noting that government interference has led to a 5.6% decrease in ISP investments, which translates to lost jobs, fewer choices, and slower speeds for consumers.  The FCC also observed that thousands of rural Internet providers have been forced to close following the 2015 regulations.  \n \nI believe that consumers are most empowered when providers are allowed to manage their networks without excessive government interference.  Net neutrality regulations, no matter how well intentioned, stifle competition in the industry and restrict consumer choices.  Across many industries, we have seen that more regulations stifle consumer choice and make it more difficult for new companies to emerge on a fair playing field.  I am sorry we disagree on this issue.  Healthy debate is a benchmark of a free republic and we are lucky to live in a nation that protects open discourse.  Rest assured that I will keep your views in mind as I continue to monitor the FCC\u2019s rulemaking process.  \n \nAgain, thank you for contacting me, and please stay in touch as I continue fighting for all Hoosiers so they can build better lives for themselves and their families.\n \nSincerely,\n \nTodd Rokita\nMember of Congress",

If we just let everyone use it as much as they want the system would collapse. I know the government gave us funds to increase capacity but that's only the main lines and they are overworked now too. Renting the infrastructure to support your toilet and preventing anyone else from having  that option was a massive investment by me. If you want to be a power user and shit and piss as much as you want you are going to have to upgrade your package. We think the provided shit and piss limit is fair and if you are exceeding it maybe you should consider changing your diet. The 4 shit a month and 3 piss a week package is suitable for 95% of the population. Only competitive eaters and losers who never leave the house need more than that. Oh you just want to piss in your backyard and bypass our infrastructure? No that's unacceptable, you might run into a terrorist out there and it's simply too dangerous to have people pissing without our oversight. \n\nEdit: Thanks for the gold! \n\nAlso wanted to add, yes we have obtained approval to begin selling the information about your bathroom habits and it's contents. We promise this is only to improve infrastructure. Information about what you eat, how often you eat it, any medications you are on and any ailments you suffer from will be anonymous. So you shouldn't care if anyone willing to pay can look up the information about your neighborhood/street. Theres no way anyone can narrow down what houses information they are looking at by seeing what food is delivered. That will never happen. \n\nOh you want to use a public shared bathroom instead? Sorry those have been outlawed because it was found terrorists and child molesters were using them. You don't want to use the same bathroom as a terrorist pedophile do you?",

    "body": "Thanks for this. Composed the following on mobile and sent. \n\nI am one of the many citizens concerned with the efforts of negating internet neutrality for the sake of profit. It seems there are many viewpoints on what this could mean for end users in the not too distant future - most of which would result in a less than optimal outcome for the majority. \n\nMy local service provider (CableOne), already seems to have a bit of a monopoly in the area as they offer the highest download/upload speed in Blank City. Pricing and data caps are nowhere near in line with offerings available around the country. Alas, it is the only option from a service standpoint, but the value continues to worsen. \n\nMyself and others fear that opening the door will allow ISP's to potentially charge more for less and/or monetize specific online services and websites. There are numerous other concerns regarding speeds, latency issues, and throttling to name just a few. My hope for this message is for it to convey the growing concerns of citizens of our great state as well as the concerns across the nation. I implore you, and your staff to educate yourselves (if you have not already) of the potential threats to this utility we have come to know, utilize, and depend on in our daily lives. Thank you for your attention on this important matter and please, take care. ",

When you call, the first thing the intern should be asking is your name, and the city you're calling from to make sure they can do something about your complaint.

Then when a vote comes up on a certain issue, the congressman is briefed on how many calls about a topic the office got and what the opposition to support ratio generally was.

Charter, and the two other ISPs in town, immediately cried foul and started a disinformation campaign, claiming that the councilwoman was attempting to implement municipal internet, and further claiming that doing so would ruin the local economy.\n\nThe city council responded by saying a committee, of which the local ISPs would be a part, to figure out the fairest way to improve local internet using the high-speed fiber. \n\nThat was in 2013. It is worth noting, our internet speeds are still the slowest in the nation.\n\nEdit: corrected date ",
