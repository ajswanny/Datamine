She begins to notice this office where's she's working at is using somewhat aggressive and downright predatory methods to get people to pay the maximum amount of money. Recommending unnecessary and very costly treatments to patients like somebody coming for a cleaning and being told they need a brand new mouth. Telling people to max out their credit cards to pay if they couldn't afford it. Telling people to take out loans to pay for treatment. A few months in to the job they tell all the employees they have to attend a Mandatory training event in Clearwater 3 days out of the month a 3 times a year. My wife had already gone to a few training events with the job and she was paid for her time and everything was buisiness as usual so we didn't see anything wrong besides being inconvenienced with the 2 hour drive. So they arrive in Clearwater to the fucking Scientology compound and my girl starts to get worried but she doesn't wanna tell me anything because I get bad anxiety and stress in situations like this so she decides to thug it out and get the extra pay. Mind you my s/o is an atheist. Not only did the \"training\" have nothing to fucking do with anything in the dental field they were pushing Scientology on them aggressively. Asking people to measure their whatever the fuck they call it, all this bullshit about suppressive people. Basically it was a 3 day event on how to scam the shit out of your customers so you can be able to send the most amount of money back to the Weird bastards. They actually had a monthly quota. A lot of her coworkers noped the fuck out of there when they got back to Miami. But you better believe those fucking dentists are still there and still scamming the shit out of anybody they can. And they even expanded their office so i guess that means they're scams are going good. I wanted to burn the fucking place down. Those sick fucks have infiltrated a lot of industries I even see some daycare centers and school type programs plastered on the windows with Hubbards beliefs and some other weird propaganda shit is so weird.

    "body": "Anecdote time! \n\nI used to work for a call center that placed people who were struggling with addiction in low-cost treatment facilities. Now I wouldn't say these facilities were *good*, but for most people struggling with addiction, insurance isn't enough to cover good treatment. \n\nAnyway, after about a month at the job I kept getting calls from people across the country who talked about \"Narcanon programs\" they'd been to. Being a novice, I just assumed that Narcanon was another 12-step modality that was maybe a little more militant. \n\nThese people would talk about the strict-abstinence programs (no detox meds like subutex or suboxone, no doctors' care, no psychological analysis) where they were fed vitamins by the hour and held in confinement for the worst parts of their detox. Oftentimes these people didn't have the choice to leave, and when they tried they were directed to another treatment group within the same facility. \n\nJust for some perspective, people who are detoxing are in an insane amount of pain and mental anguish. Even the worst rehab facilities in the country offer medicine and therapy to help the patient cope. Hearing this again and again made me really question how this treatment was so widespread - there are dozens of options for a person struggling with addiction, and none of them are as painful, isolating, and militant as Narcanon seemed. \n\nAnyway, after a few months of listening to these horror stories from patients throughout the country, I decided to go to my superior and ask about Narcanon. He closed his office door and without skipping a beat said, \"Narcanon is Scientology.\" \n\nYou can read into it more online, but the facts are that Scientology runs a massive network of rehab facilities across the country that prey on low-income addicts. My boss had his own theories about why Scientology would do this in the first place (indoctrination, tax benefits, encroaching on psychiatry's territory, etc.), but the takeaway was that Narcanon was created to poach people from twelve-step programs. \n\nIt's been a decade since I worked at that call center, but every now and then I'll meet a Narcanon survivor. Never once have I heard a sunny happy story about Narcanon, and the vast majority of stories involve what in any other situation would be considered kidnapping. \n\nThe root problem is that our society doesn't really care for the drug-addicted or the mentally-ill person. These people are considered burdens, so any issue that compounds their mental state or addiction is brushed aside as \"not my problem\".\n\nI'm glad to see this story on the front page, only because it's shedding light on what I heard for years. \n\n**TL;DR** - worked at a call center for rehab facilities and heard horror stories about what amounted to torture and kidnapping from Scientology-run rehabs across the country.

I was so fucking sick. I wasn't allowed to use a phone or write letters and they refused to take me to a doctor. They continued to put me on kitchen duty despite having a lethal, highly contagious infection. Luckily, family visitation fell on the first weekend I was there and my grandpa took one look at my arm and said \"pack your things, we're leaving\". I started packing, they tried to stop us. Threatened us with legal action, saying they'd report my grandfather for kidnapping me if we left. We were out of there pretty quickly but they tried to separate us and talk it out first. While I was alone they told me I was sick because I'd done terrible things and my body was making me suffer for it, that if I just admitted I was bad, the infection would go away. I imagine if I'd been in an adult facility there wouldn't have been visitation and I would have died. \n\n\nEdited for clarity",

Went to the dentist when I was visiting my family in the States and was basically told that my mouth was a cesspool of cavities and that I needed to get my wisdom teeth (all 4 of which grew in perfectly straight, by the way) removed because they were gonna give my other teeth cavities (???). I, being the naive nervous wreck that I am, agreed and got as many \"cavities\" filled as I could at the time before I went back to Brazil. I could only get about 6 of the apparent ten million cavities worked on and had to pay a ton out of pocket because my insurance is shit. After I passed in the federal university here in Brazil, I went to the dentist at one of the university's clinics (which is all free) and told her this whole story and about how I still have tons of work to be done, etc. I kid you not, the lady looked around my mouth with her little mirror for, like, 10 seconds, got this pissed look on her face, and told me that I have absolutely wonderful teeth and that she'd never seen someone who had all 4 of their wisdom teeth grow in as well as mine had. She said that judging by the size of the filings I had, NOT ONE OF THEM was necessary. The \"cavities\" that I have are really just natural irregularities of the enamel, and while, yes, some of them could *one day* become cavities, there's no reason to drill them open and fill them unless they start causing problems. Drilling them open and filling them actually makes teeth *more* susceptible to cavities around the filled in area than if they are just left alone. So, basically, this prick ruined my teeth by drilling them open unnecessarily. \n\nTL;DR -- Asshole dentist in my hometown drilled away at my teeth for no reason other than to make money, effectively fucking up my otherwise healthy teeth. For money. Because he's a prick. ",

I remember hearing the specific department's chief took donation money or something from the church and attended their galas/events.\n\nAs for LAPD however, this story about the LAPD police captain \"promoting\" scientology is the only compelling story I found: https://whyweprotest.net/threads/lapd-captain-dave-storaker-promoting-scientology.132524/\n\nCould be harmless advocacy, but this forum is framing it as if the Church is in cahoots with the LAPD. I haven't read much of the thread but it appears department officials are blocking the users for calling them out on twitter.",

If anything scientology related comes up the police higher-ups usually give a courtesy call to scientology to inform them before the cops show up. \n* Leah knew this, so she asked a favor of police officer friend (who used to moonlight as a security guard on king of queens). The plan was he would come to her house, take her report, take a letter Leah wrote instructing Shelly urging to leave right away with the police and that she'd take care of her. Then Leah's police friend would file the missing person report and immediately go to where they thought Shelly would be. If scientology got no tip off, they couldn't move or hide Shelly or call in a favor with the police chief to look the other way, and best case scenario Shelly would go with Leah's police officer friend and be taken to Leah's house.\n* The police higher-ups did end up intervening. The missing person report was taken away from Leah's police friend, and the usual courtesy tip-off ensued. \n* No law enforcement official actually saw or spoke with Shelly. They spoke to David Miscavige or a Scientology rep who tole them Shelly was fine and that Leah was crazy. That was good enough for them and they closed the case. \n",

If they call themselves a church, the government literally has no power over them. They are tax exempt, they can operate in almost any form they wish uncontested. Pretty certain parts of the IRS doesn't even give a shit about the money circulation from Scientology even though taxing them would give them good amount of money.\n\nThis is why cults are so prevalent in America and places that allow religious freedom. It's one of those \"good\" things that backfire in our face when assholes try to take advantage of it. Can't blame the country. I mean look at half of America; few dozen terrorist attacks in the span of 2 decades and people freak out trying to kick Muslims out and deny religious freedom.

Actor is threatened with blacklisting if they don't pay/continue paying.\n\nAlso a lot of it is family relations. If you ever try to leave, you will never talk to your family again (if they remain).\n\nThere are some cases, like Cruise, where I'm not entirely sure he's just not insane and actually believes what they are selling.

    "body": "At the time he originally wanted to leave Scientology, it was the 70s or 80s. Allegations like that would have immediately ended his career. And now, hes so caught up. When youre in Scientology, thats your whole life. If he left, he could never see his wife, kids, friends, etc. again. A lot of people assume that celebrities stay because theyre either being blackmailed or are naive to whats happening. While either can be true, ex Scientologists such as Leah Remini say that the real reason is because it's literally your entire life. It's difficult enough (emotionally speaking) for people raised in religions such as Christianity to admit doubts even when there are no repercussions for doing so. In Scientology, voicing concerns can mean at the very least hours of interrogation. ",
