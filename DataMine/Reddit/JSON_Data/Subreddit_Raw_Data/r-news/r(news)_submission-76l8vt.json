    "body": "My story isn't quite as bad, but a cop once mistook muffin crumbs for weed. So in high school, my boyfriend and I would park at a local park to get away from parents' prying eyes and... you know.\n\nWell a few days prior, I'd baked blueberry muffins and had packed a few in a ziploc bag for my Sunday morning breakfast. We spent the entire day together after church and at night ended up parked when a cop decided to talk to us. However, we weren't doing anything at that point and we were each clearly in our own seats. \n\nThe cop then proceeded to ask us to get out of the car and asked to search our car, which being naive teenagers, we of course said yes. Eventually, the cop got to my purse, pulled out this nearly empty bag of crumbs, and accusingly asked me, \"And what's *THIS*?\"\n\nI was totally confused and just replied, \"My breakfast?\"\n\nThe cop then looked at the bag again and eventually let us leave. Maybe it was my response that clued him in that we weren't druggies... Or maybe it was the folded up muffin cups that gave it away? \n\nWho knew drug dealers dealt in bake sales?",

Others were not convicted of a crime because scientific evidence such as blood tests showed that they were not impaired.\n\nThat officer is considered to be an excellent employee. Asked about the discrepancy between lab tests and arrest decisions, the Cobb County Police Department told the local news that \"they stand by the arrests\"; \"[t]he department doubled-down on their assertion that the drug recognition expert is better at detecting marijuana in a driver than scientific tests.\"\n\nUnclear how many other people in the profession behave this way.",

I\u2019m pursuing a slam-dunk case for malicious defamation against a private citizen and potentially a lawmaker. The guy went crying to known terrorists that I stole $100K because I was inconveniently insisting on financial audits. He admits to the defamation because he thinks it\u2019s all covered under \u201cfree speech.\u201d The case is assured.\n\nBut in the meantime I\u2019m broke. I can\u2019t even come up with the rest of my retainer for another two weeks *even though I still have people after me.* See, on Google, I\u2019m a fraud. I don\u2019t get work and my student loans have fallen into default again, so no job in the field for me anymore. I\u2019m expecting a really old prescription drug reimbursement that will pay the rest of the retainer. I don\u2019t know when or if I get my reputation back, but I had a six-year-old consulting company that is now known in public to be a fraud. I was getting work from National Geographic, the State of Colorado, etc.\n\nIn a few *years* I might see money from that lawsuit. These things drag on even when there is no law enforcement trying to cover itself. In the meantime, these are the kinds of things that ruin your life, give you nightmares, and force you to focus on how powerless the incident made you because that\u2019s what the entire case is about.\n\nSuing people because they ruined your life still sucks because your life still gets ruined. I could get everything this guy owns and it wouldn\u2019t bring back the person I was before. It\u2019s always preferable to not have your life ruined. And it\u2019s not like settlements drop out of the sky and there is a line of contingency-only lawyers looking to help you out. It takes work and money to get all that set up, and precisely when you are at your lowest.",

Like seriously what does the government expect from this? That punishing people by denying them employment after being freed is somehow going to prevent them from commiting crimes? Hell no. What do you think a drug dealer is going to do when he gets freed from prison  if he can't get a job? He's gonna go back to selling drugs and commiting crimes! Let the person get a job and ya know what? Maybe they'll have learned their lesson.\n\nIn the US if you have a record employers can deny you a job. Where I live if you have a record (particularly the example of drug possession) and you aren't hired specifically because of that it's a violation of your rights and the government will sue the employer on your behalf. Unless a circumstance like you're convicted of robbery and are applying for a job at a bank, then that's reasonable grounds to deny you a job. \n\nEdit: It seems it is federally illegal to deny someone a job on ground of a criminal record in the US.

One of those times I found a bag with a little bit of meth in it underneath my bed and then within an hour I also found a piece of black tar heroin that was stuck to an alcohol swab wrapper from yesterdays shot. For the record I wasn\u2019t so far gone that it wasn\u2019t actually drugs I found lol. I shot them together shortly after finding them. \n\nBut then there are also those times where you know damn well you didn\u2019t drop any shards, but you look anyways. Sometimes random little things like dust or small debris gleams like crystal and catches your eye, and part of you keeps fastening your eyes on these little things because they look like meth in your mind; part of you keeps scrutinizing nothing in particular because it is pretty and you have nothing else to do. \n\nSimilar thing happens when I am out in the city at night with another tweaker up to no good and watching for cops. We would be on alert and up tight, watching the traffic for patrol cars. Our eyes scanning the city streets like security cameras. After a certain point the only reason I was even watching the traffic and scanning the city with hyperfocused intent was because it was just so beautiful. All the shiny and pretty lights the cars made as they cruised down the streets just kept catching my eye and my focus.\n\nKeep in mind this only happens like 3 days deep into a run of no sleep... but ya.

Their colors aren't distinct enough, they don't include the instructions on the kit and quite frankly they are cheap.  All that being said, all that video demonstrated was inexperience is what leads to false-positives, not the kits themselves.  They were completely disregarding the instructions and then completely mis-interpreting the results.\n\nIn the first test where he tests nothing but \"air\" and claims its positive.  That was not a positive at all, not even fucking close.  A positive in that kit is a much deeper color.  When you insert the substance into the kit the color will \"radiate\" off of the substance you put in.  That wasn't a false-positive, that's an idiot that either doesn't know what a real positive looks like or he is purposefully lying to support his point.\n\nIn the other tests they are putting items into the test that, when coming into contact with the acid, produce the same color as the positive.  No shit, you don't take blue dyed items and put them into the test kit.  Not to mention, it again WASN'T s positive.  That's not what a positive looks like at all in that particular kit.  It occurs to me that those individuals probably didn't' have access to the real controlled substances and had never seen what a true positive result looks.\n\nI'll admit I hate the cocaine test kit, no matter the brand.  It's a very hard result to interpret.  It generates a pink over blue positive result.  The test is designed to differentiate between \"crack\" cocaine and cocaine.  Inexperienced officers will put substances into the kit and test.  They get the pink result during the first ampule which DOES NOT MEAN positive.  It merely means that, if the final ampule is blue-positive it's crack cocaine rather than just cocaine.\n\nI've used these kits upwards of 800+ times in my career and only once ever had a false-positive, which was my error in interpretation.  It was the cocaine kit, and I interpreted wrong for the exact reason listed above.  Not that mattered, it still came back for a controlled substance just not cocaine.  Was back when \"bath salts\" came out in 2014 and it was the first time I'd seen it.",

In it was used loose tea leaves, which someone thought looked enough like some kind of \"marijuana production byproduct\" (I think that's what they called it?) to subject to an on-site test, which of course indicated it was weed.  As I recall, they didn't even send the leaves off to be properly tested in a lab to confirm before they moved against the family with accusations of running a grow op or so.  Between buying some basic hydro equipment, and used tea leaves, cops thought the family had a home full of plants.\n\nEdit to add relevant news story: https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-watch/wp/2015/12/28/federal-judge-drinking-tea-shopping-at-a-gardening-store-is-probable-cause-for-a-swat-raid-on-your-home/",
