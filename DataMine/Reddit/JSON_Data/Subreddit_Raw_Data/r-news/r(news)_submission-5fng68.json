You may fear that you'll be too tired to raise a child when you're over 30. \n\nBullshit. \n\nI had kids way before I was ready, and while I would live in North Korea before I gave them up, I assure you that I would have waited long over a decade if I knew then what I know now.

Camp in Death Valley or clamped to the side of a mountain. Do all of these things that only affect you. But once you have a spouse and/or children, let these experiences shape you as a spouse/parent. Don't mourn the fact that you didn't get to protest at Standing Rock because you have a \"job.\" Instead, remember the time you slept in a barn in Fiji, and tell your kids to go follow *their* whims and convictions. Don't lament the fact that you have to fly instead of drive because it's the faster way to your business trip. Instead, make sure your wife has reliable transportation so she and the girls can go see where Elvis lived (just like you did). \n\nLive life, but for god's sake, make sure there's enough time to do so. Don't rush. Death will come soon enough. \n\nI guess what I'm trying to say is, hang on to that sock for a while. You're gonna need it. ",

I love it!\n\nbut here's the thing about solitude...\n\nSolitude is a lot like skydiving. It's only fun when you know you're wearing a parachute.\n\nMy mom, my brothers, my best friend, my niece. Those are my parachutes.\n\nI enjoy being alone because I choose to be but I also know that I have people that will be happy to spend time with me whenever I want them to.\n\nAnd just like skydiving, you can't do it for long without pulling the parachute or hitting the ground.\n\nSame goes for solitude. You can't do it for long without coming up for some air. We are pack animals, we are social creatures, we need family and friends and companions.\nWe might can go hours, days, and maybe even weeks alone but only if we know we have people to go home to when we're ready.\n\nPeople who don't have anyone, who are living a life of solitude without a parachute, are going to crash one day. One day it's just going to hit that they don't have anyone when they need them (or even just when they want them) and it's going to hurt like hell.\n\nthose people in those old nursing homes....man it's so damn sad. Even the ones that get visitors only get a couple of hours if they're lucky and then they're alone again all day, every day, and it breaks their spirits.\n\nSo having a family means having someone who is going to be there when you're no longer young enough to go around making friends left and right.\n\nand frankly the adventure lifestyle only works if you're good at making friends left and right wherever you go, and I've never been good at that shit, so I'm glad/lucky/blessed that I was born into a great family, but my nana's getting older, my mom's getting older, and both of my brother's have their own lives (the especially the one that's engaged) so if I don't go out there and find a wife and have kids of my own, best case scenario I'll end up visiting my brothers once a week and spending the rest of that week alone and miserable.",

Maybe if women who choose to become single mothers have to pay for that child themselves and don't have the option of suing for child support, they'd rethink their options, and maybe we'd have fewer singly-mothered children out there? Maybe if taxpayers had to shoulder the full burden of the government's welfare payments for children, rather than letting the government go after unwilling fathers to recoup them, more people in society would be incentivized to pressure women to make intelligent choices about when to become a parent? \n\nThat societal change would cause consequences is not a valid excuse for refraining from instituting said changes, particularly not when those consequences are arguably entirely deserved.",

Yes it's a good guiding principle, however in the end under the law there will always be a compromise struck between the personal liberties of the parent, the benefit to society and the child's best interests (whatever you define those as). For example abortion is absolutely not in the childs best interests, ask an adult who came from a poor, neglectful family if they'd rather not have been born and you'll probably be told to piss off. Abortion privileges the freedom of the mother and health of society as a whole over the well being of a potential but not yet realised child. \n\nSimilarly implementing financial abortion would privilege the fathers personal freedoms over a potential but not yet realised child. Removing a perverse fiscal incentive that can encourage women to bear children in circumstances they otherwise wouldn't. Doing so in my opinion would benefit society as a whole by encouraging child birth only where the family unit is stable or where the mother has the resources to go it alone.\n\n This is of course predicated on the assumption that feminists are successful in their righteous goal of ensuring abortion becoming widely and easily available without the burden of stigma and partisan politics.

Having a child while on welfare exempts a person from any extra need based benefits that they might have received. \n\nWhen seeking welfare benefits, SNAP/TANF, the gov't mandates that single parents, particularly single mothers, provide information about the biological parent. This is so that they can pursue child support from the other parent. The child support is paid to a gov't account which will cut a check for the guardian parent as part of their welfare benefits. The welfare recipient does not really get extra money for this, but rather, part of the welfare is provided by the estranged parent. \n\nIt sounds like a good idea, but it is kind of fucked up. What likely happened is that they fell on hard times well after having the child. Seeking welfare opportunity as a single mother requires that you provide information about the (usually also poor) father so that the gov't can make them pay for part of the welfare receipt. This system usually winds up punishing poor single mothers because it typically sours the relationship with the father and can even cause jail time for the  (again, usually poor) fathers who are unable to give financial assistance.

We doesn't want our first daughter to be left without any family when we pass.\n\nBut, on the pro side: we're in a better position to help guide our children through life than we would have been in our twenties.  We have nearly 20 years more life experience, which helps to inform our decisions in every aspect of parenthood.  \n\nAnother really important factor to consider is that we have our identities and life goals sorted. So we're free to dedicate all our energy and resources to raising our kids. \n\n\n\n",

Probably something related to the Common-Law adopted in the anglosphere.\n\nIn other countries where Civil Law is predominant, things can be really different. I can speak for my country, Brazil: being biological father IS what matter in the legal context.\n\n* If you pay child support and after 10 years you find out that the mother lied to you, the not-father can sue the mother and take the 10 years of support back. In fact, if the mother lied and it was possible to prove it, the not-father can not only take the money back, but sue her for punitive damages. She, in the other hand, could sue the real-father for the 10 years of unpaid support\n\n* If you register a child as your son/daughter and you find out later that you're not (DNA test), you can easily change the child registry and disestablish paternity. You're not the father, after all\n\n\nOther example is regarding marriage regime. From what I've heard, in the US pre-nups aren't strong and sometimes they're not accepted by a court, so it's difficult to have property security when going in a Marriage (\"for the good of the family\"). Here in Brazil, our civil code explicit creates a \"separation of property Regime\", where all property, pre-marital or marital, is owned separately. If a couple want to get married but not mess with their properties, it's easy, secure and upheld in court.",

Or offer options for benefit recipients to do menial jobs in exchange and save on some federal salaries (surely even a disabled person can lick some envelopes and mail out notices and stuff).

    "body": "I think the intersectionality arguments on inequality often miss the extent to which class can and will create new threads of disunity.\n\nYes, race matters, but fundamentally only because of a correlation between race/appearance/behavior and class. Race/appearance/behavior thus become signals of class, and because it is a combination of mind-share and current correlation, you get a long-running and often overriding/contradictory signal. For example: \n\n* White middle-aged man in an ill-fitting suit => Wedding? Interview? (heuristic judgment)\n* Black man in an ill-fitting suit => going to court? (racist heuristic leading to a classist judgment)\n* White, skinny man with pock scars on his face in an ill-fitting suit => going to court? (appearance heuristic leading to a classist judgment)\n* Indian man in an ill-fitting suit => going to a tech job interview? (also racist heuristic leading to a classist judgment)\n\n^(I suddenly feel like using shitty examples of racism inherently will make everyone think I'm super racist)\n\nVisible racial minority and appearance are fast and easy signals for attaching stereotypes and generalizations. Everyone does this, even if you think you do not. \"Otherizing\" is a default mode of human behavior.\n\n/u/dread_beard had a good point about your local downtrodden, as it generalizes the problem, I think.  One way to reduce the correlations is to change appearance/behavior. This works on a micro level to an extent and has been a major strategy for the downtrodden for a long time. Once you change you don't trigger the correlation and presumably are treated better. Obviously, some characteristics like the color of your skin or un-coverable tattoos can otherize you by default, which makes the problem asymmetric. These changes have positive group effects at the expense of individuals, creating a hard free-rider problem which additionally can otherize you to your own downtrodden group since you could be treated as a \"collaborator\" of sorts. Also, even if you changed all the signals but didn't fix the class aspect of the downtrodden, then you just end up with new signals/correlations and you have a similar problem, like the awful second example above. The idea of a middle class black person being an \"oreo\" (and somehow out of place) fits in this bucket.\n\nI think the only way to change the long-run equilibrium is at the class level. You need to have such intense upward mobility and inequality busting that over time you reduce the strength of the correlation by increasing the randomness of class and reducing the distance from top to bottom in general.\n\nAs class is largely inherited currently, it doesn't matter that progress happens one grave at a time, because even if all racists and stereotypicals disappeared right now, you would still have the inertia of wealth/class and other culture together to feed the old class correlation and new stereotypes. \n\nRacism and stereotypes are just memes. Class, however, is not just a meme because it represents your claim on resources. And people with fewer resources will live differently. And so, class differences to an extent generate the cultural and behavioral differences that underlie some of the triggers for racism and stereotypes. One example is bus ridership; tons of suburban folk have never ridden a public transit bus before. The differences reduce the shared portion of the social Venn diagram and makes others' personal experiences harder to relate to, generating the psychological distance necessary to otherize them.\n\npre-edit: holy shit WoT, sorry for thinking out loud at you for like 10 minutes\n\nedit: this is not to suggest that we should not move strongly against racism and bigotry, just that those gains can be eroded if material class is not addressed",

    "body": "Nah, they slashed taxes for businesses and the wealthy. It's worked out abysmally. It was supposed to trickle down and never did (surprise!). In fact personal wealth has gone DOWN in Kansas. \n\nBecause the economic plan has gone so poorly (a plan that was routinely criticized prior to implementation. But the Tea Party Republicans in Kansas can't comprehend the slightest of criticism), they've had to slash a lot of budget, particularly Education. Traditionally Kansas has has pretty good to outright great education. Now some districts are being forced to close early and teachers are leaving. My brother graduated with an education degree around the same time with a lot of ambition teaching highschool in his home state. He's a mailman now. \n\nKansas traditionally has had very well kept roads and highways. Budget has been slashed and so have our tires. The decline in driving quality is obvious. \n\nThe revenue is so fucking low right now and something has to change. But they'd rather trust their conservative economic ideals, stay the course and eventually go down with the ship.",
