    "body": "I take a monthly injection. I'm terrified this is gonna happen, especially during the holidays. It's not like it would kill me, but it may well prevent me from taking the medication in the future as the cost of replacing it that month would be exorbitantly high (non-refundable once it leaves the distribution center) and you can build a tolerance to the medication if you skip doses.\n\nEdit: For those curious, the medication in question is a biologic drug which means the immune system can learn to recognize and fight back against it. This might entail a diminished impact or an allergic reaction. A steady dose apparently helps to prevent this from happening. The recommendation is that I take it within 24 hours of the 21 day mark (doses every 3 weeks). \n\nThe delivery is further complicated by the need to keep the medication refrigerated (but never frozen). I'd also like to clarify that, while I worry a lot about this, I've also taken many steps to ensure that it doesn't happen and explored quite a few others.",

I've delivered packages inside hollow furniture, behind massive potted plants, etc.  Just give us a place to leave your package where it can't easily be seen from the street.  Chances are the person delivering will leave your package whether its totally hidden or not, so give us something to work with!\n\n* If you plan to be out of town for several days, *don't have your packages delivered to your house*.  I can't even count how many houses I've delivered to that have a growing pile of packages on their front porch for several days.  If you can, make arrangements to have it delivered with a neighbor.\n\n* If you live in an apartment building, leave a comment with your order to have the package delivered to the leasing office if they will accept it.

I'm not legally able to own a firearm so when I heard someone trying to open our back door I grabbed my Gurkha knife and ran downstairs to confront them. I don't know why I did that because they could have had  a gun and also I'm not a large man, if they were big and tough enough (they weren't) they could have disarmed me and shoved my own knife up my ass. I think being up on a two day meth binge had something to do with it. I was really to absolutely butcher this person if they didn't run. I must have looked crazy enough because they ran. I got my girlfriend and we jumped in the car and called 911. I did this because I figured it was safer than staying put. When we were getting in the car I noticed the trunk was open and dome lights were on. This asshole had already ransacked our car (nothing of value except a camera in there) and was coming inside for more. I shut the trunk and we were off, pulling out I saw him running between the houses to the next block over so I drove around the block. He was walking casually down the street (at 2am in a residential neighborhood) doing the whole whistling minding my own business act. My first instinct was to casually drive past and at the last second swerve and fuck his shit up and leave  him mangled in the road but my girlfriend was not ok with that so I just got a good look at his face and waited for the cops. They met me at my house and I told them everything. They were actually proactive for once and were already combing the neighborhood and caught the guy in minutes. I told them I could identify him so they brought me by in a car with a spot light shining in his face so he couldn't see me. Identified him and he is STILL in jail awaiting trial (its been one year) because he doesn't have money for bond, he is pleading not guilty so he is counting on going to trial. Very satisfying and I'm not in prison for murder! But yeah he had a grocery bad full of our shit from our porch and the camera from our car. I can't wait to see the look on his face when he finds out he was about to break into a house unarmed with a very pissed off junky who planned to cut him up and run him down and leave him in the street to die. I have been on heroin on and off for years and never resorted to stealing so I hate thieves.

Even with insurance, because of all the copays and maximum out of pocket expense bullshit, I was looking at close to $4k. Not necessarily a huge amount of money, but completely unattainable for a young college kid who was only getting enough income to scrape by from the Army and VA scholarships. \n\nI remember calling a company that specializes in banking for US military members to try and apply for a loan to pay these medicals expenses, and getting denied.

They had been bothering me for 11+ years -- making me sick, causing my glands in my neck to swell, aching/stinging, and making me intolerant to some foods. I hated simply eating anything because of them. I held off surgery for a long time, out of fear and just hoping they would get better, but I got fed up and got them out. The surgery went fine but they were a fucking mess and for all intents and purposes it did end up being somewhat medically necessary. \n\n\nAnyway, for that small surgery I came out with a bill around the same amount as yours. Insurance only covered a tiny bit and I was expected to pay the rest, almost directly out of surgery. You know... when I was taking off work, obviously. No one told me I'd have other bills either so they just kept popping up and many I had to keep paying late because I only make around $9.50/hr. And that's still working fulltime.\n\n\nI kept thinking to myself \"If this is how things are for me, a white, single, ~~middle-class~~ working class person, I can't even imagine being in poverty or with children and getting seriously ill and dealing with the medical bills.\"\n\n\nIt's outrageous. Our system is broken... they would literally have you die homeless than just provide decent medical care.\n\n\n~~Edit: Debate over my payrate, I guess? Tell me I'm actually rich without knowing my personal life if it makes y'all happy... but either way it is still tough and I would prefer it if *no one* in this country had these problems. I pride myself in being in a lot of grassroots orgs in my town that are for supporting workers fairly, so it's not like I am kidding myself and denying my own privilege/social status.~~\n\n\nEdit 2: Bunch of clarity stuff, wrong terminology (although my other points still stand)\n\n\nEdit 3: Wow my first gold!

This is WAY better than either staying home anticipating a delivery, or getting one of those @#$&* \"sorry we missed you\" notices on my door.\n\nI thought for years that FedEx & UPS should have an option where you pay a different, slightly lower rate to have your package delivered to a retail location for pickup, vs. left at your door.  Since they're not delivering it they don't have to put it on their truck, or drive it to your house, so it should be a bit cheaper.

I've heard people who can't afford to get a reliable car say \"I'm not poor, I'm lower middle class\" meanwhile my dentist, who owns two boats and has a summer house on Nantucket also considers himself middle class as well. \n\nI think the best way to define the middle class currently is by saving habits. The lower class can't afford to put money away, they need it now. The middle class makes enough to be able to save for retirement in a 401k and are thinking about how their current spending could affect them in the future. The upper class does not need to think about where they are putting their money, they can hire advisors to actively manage their retirement. ",

As a twelve year old I got to witness how truly horrifying untreatable spinal and brain cancer for a poor family is as I watch my mother, the non-abusive one at the parent level, slowly change into something that would challenge what one might classify as human both physically and mentally.  And when it seemed like it was at its worst, life showed you how absolutely wrong you were about that.  I cannot for the life of me understand why any country would ever view medically assisted suicide as wrong.  I get the arguments that there's those who are \"just depressed\" who \"might\" abuse it, but it is just like the drug problem, continuing to make it taboo doesn't mean it just goes away and just prevents everyone from having a meaningful discussion at a serious and legal level.  Those that are still able, are going to commit suicide without help and medically assisted suicide might just actually help folks who are depressed, at the very least, get referred for help.  Those who are no longer able suffer and suffer in ways that aren't only measurable by what it does to them but what it does to everyone connected to that person.  A person suffering is incredibly important and don't let anyone think that it isn't the paramount thing here.  But there is a suffering that happens too, that has longer effects in those who watch minute by minute the person who is suffering.  I would never suggest assisted suicide for just the family's sake, but I will say, that not doing anything, that just ignoring the issue, it not only hurts those who suffer, it hurts those who love and are deeply emotionally connected to those who suffer too.",
