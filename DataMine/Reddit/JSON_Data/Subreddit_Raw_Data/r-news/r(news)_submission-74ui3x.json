The first family we were with was great there were 4 other kids so we made 6, they had enough room, we made it to school on time,they fed us everyday..coming from home it was a step up. \n\nFor some reason we were moved to a different family. Tina and Greg...they had 7 children, we made 9. \n\nWithin a month of being there we saw that things weren't normal like the previous house. If you didn't make your own food you didn't eat. They grocery shopped once a month and spent $400 on food (yes thy sounds like a lot for anyone but 11 people in one house..) and if it was gonna before then end of the month then no one ate. Many times they would just leave us at the house and not tell anyone they were leaving. The oldest in the house at the time was 12. \nOur bedroom was the downstairs basement. We had a mix between air mattress's and cord. Whoever did the most chores in the month would get the air mattress. \nAfter almost three months of being with Tina and Greg they lost a baby. Greg was angry. I had never seen anyone that angry, he asked her questions like \"WHAT THE HELL DID YOU DO TO IT\"\n\"HOW DO YOU JUST LOSE A BABY\"\nGreg smacked Tina dead in the face and she got the floor because she was crying so hard over the baby she couldn't answer..about a week later he turned his anger to us kids...\n\nWhen your young and trapped there's no where else to go with out getting in trouble or trapped. I spoke with my case worker multiples times about our \"parents\" at the time and they said we'll look into it. Its sad to see she is gone. And i hate seeing when people take advantage of lost broken children...but honestly she probably welcomed death..I tried four times..Courtney (a girl in the house tried as well and was taken out of the house). At that point you feel trapped, you feel lost, you feel like it's the last place on earth you'll ever be. ",

THESE TWO, drugs or not, had a home, a background check allowed them to adopt, and they ran a DAYCARE.  Other people's children were being watched by these lunatics?\n\nI dunno what the hell to think about that.  How can monsters do this to their own family and somehow maintain a business model that dictates that they must do literally the exact opposite thing (meaning CARING for the kids.  DayCARE) that they are doing for their own children.\n\nThis makes it so much worse in my mind that I can barely think straight.  If a couple is addicted to heroin and this happens, at the very least I can save 1% of my rage and think, \"Addiction is terrible.  They are awful people, but maybe I can wrap my head around forgiving them on some level for their not doing this PROACTIVELY and with proper conscious understanding of their actions\"\n\nBut if THESE motherfuckers are able to treat the neighbor's kid well enough to maintain a business, that means they knew exactly what they were doing.\n\nIt almost makes one wish Rust Cohle was on this case, because I think there might be more going on here.  Does anyone know anything about this case aside from what's online?  I can't get over the concept that they ran a daycare.  This is like when you read about a surgeon proactively killing people vs a surgeon with a drinking problem who accidentally killed people.  Both deserve massive punishment, but the latter surgeon can be helped and brought back into society again (save for any chance at medical practice, fuck that) but that FIRST surgeon?  That motherfucker is done and should never see the light of day again.  \n\nFuck this.  For the one person who actually read this -- I appreciate your helping me vent.  I need to go run around the block a few times or something, I just can't understand this one on any level.  ",

All the other neighbours knew bad stuff was happening in that home, and were talking about it, but were too scared to get involved.    Didn't want to be labelled a \"busy body\".\n\nAfter I turned him in (cops were involved) people distanced themselves.   I guess they didn't want to be associated with the \"unpleasantness\".    He tried to bully me out of my home by intimidating me, but I ignored him.    Little squirt.    Abuses his wife too.   (I am a single mother).\n\nBy the way, a friend of mine and I had a discussion.   She said \"If you don't do it, I'm going to\".   She knows them, but is not actually a neighbour of theirs .... just lives in the same small town.     I said I would do it.   They hate and vilify me to this day, but are still friendly towards her.   They don't know she was a hair's breadth from being the one that went to the authorities.\n\nHere is another part of the story.   The old guy who lived next door to them died and a new younger couple moved in.   I have never met them.   They very quickly became drinking buddies with the couple in question.   There's a lot of heavy drinking goes on over there, which is fine with me.   Anyway I have never met them, but they refuse to make eye contact or wave at me in the way neighbours usually do.   Stupid people have drunk the cool aid.  It's amazing to me how gullible some people are.    \n\nThis is why people don't get involved.    Abusers can be very, very manipulative and can *easily* get people on their side with lies and innuendo.   Job One for them is to claim the victim card for themselves.  There is a price to pay if you are the one who finally stands up to them.   People are afraid to pay that price.\n\n\nEdit:   Thank you to all the people making very kind comments, and to the person who gave me a gold medal .... I will wear it with pride!\n",

It's a huge problem for that state and many others.

I\u2019d seen 3 or 4 little kids playing in their yard so I knew they were somewhere inside that house hiding from a big scary man who was obviously drunk, obviously punching walls, obviously pissed off at his \u201cwhore\u201d girlfriend, and very possibly looking for something warm and unable to fight back to hit for a little bit. I was outside working on my truck when I heard it so I went inside to inform my family thinking maybe they knew him or had dealt with it before. They told me that he\u2019s \u201cjust like that\u201d and that they don\u2019t get involved.\n\nI pretty much lost my shit at that point and had to walk back outside so they wouldn\u2019t see my tears. There were kids in there, man.\n\nI called the sheriff\u2019s department out and explained what was happening and they came out to talk to the guy. They ended up leaving after making him leave I assume. I resolved that night that I would immediately call law enforcement if I ever heard anything else like that over there. In the end I ended up having to call LEOs at least 6 more times over a span of about 2 months. Nothing ever happened to him legally but I think my constant pestering and involvement of law enforcement caused them to finally call it off. Before we moved out of it in law\u2019s house the guy had moved out and the woman had moved on to what I can only assume from the lack of violence emanating from the area was better for everyone involved.\n\nI don\u2019t know what his problem was and I\u2019m not one of those feminist guys or anything but nothing can justify what I heard coming out of that house. Both the man and the woman were pretty trashy people but they didn\u2019t matter. My responsibility was to speak up for the people in that house who were unable or unwilling to speak for themselves. As a MAN my responsibility was to protect those kids. Anyone who can ignore that type of situation, justify their inaction, and lay their head down to sleep without a second thought about the people they\u2019re harming is a piece of human garbage.",

    "body": "While the \"how could you not get involved?\" idea is tempting, I do feel the need to be that annoying counter voice just to remind people that getting involved in something can have unintended consequences.\n\nGrowing up there was a family that lived across the street from me where the father was very abusive. Very aggressive, very violent. Everybody knew but nobody wanted to get involved.\n\nAt one point the neighbors on one side of him decided to and helped get his wife and son out. The father came home to find them gone and he went banging on doors trying to find them. The neighbors said they'd helped her get to a shelter and the guy went apeshit. He thought the neighbors were hiding his wife and son and went so far as to get a gun from his house and stand out on their lawn after trying to kick down the front door.\n\nHe had the bright idea that setting the bushes in front of the house on fire would get them to leave the house. Presumably he thought if the building was on fire they'd leave. This being suburbia, someone called the police and they showed up in a hurry. Part of the front of the neighbor's house was destroyed by the fire and while they were both thankfully ok, he made it very clear he intended to shoot them.\n\nThe father went to jail but he's not going to be there forever.\n\nAt the time I'd been very upset at my parents because I was about the son's age and while I didn't know him well we did hang out and I wanted my parents to do something. They refused to get involved and after I saw the front of the house they said \"and that's why you don't get involved.\"\n\nI think the best thing to do is to be supportive and grateful to people who do have the courage to get involved in a bad situation but I don't think it benefits anyone to heap scorn on people who are afraid to get involved.",

That, and with all the rules about amount of kids and amount of work hours, it's actually become very difficult to get into (she needed to get a, what I imagine translates to, vocational degree a few years ago when policies changed), and quite difficult to, when you're in, turn a profit. \n\nMy mom finds all the new rules and regulations incredibly frustrating as she's been doing the job for like 25 years now, but does understand there's a reason to most of it. She's actually managed to carve out a pretty good business in our town with it, as she does adhere strictly to the rules, and is fully licensed, and popular with parents, so she's able to make quite some dough (we're still quite lower-middle class, mind ya, but considering), but actually getting into it is basically impossible. Our town has an incredible lack of people doing this, my mom gets requests from like 5 new parents a month.\n\nPoint is, while the rules and regulations are there for a reason, it has caused a certain scarcity of these people in my town. Not everyone can afford to take schooling and tons of classes before even being able to make a dime, on what is considered a pretty basic job (to the extent that teenagers do it under the table all the time).",

Which are terrible for a child's personal development in some ways, but in other ways incredibly beneficial. (Learning to socialize with others for example and being more accepting/non judgemental)\n\nHowever raising a foster kid takes a lot of work, support from you, and willingness to accept someone new into their lives on the childs end. Remember in most cases the child didn't ask to be put into care, they were likely forced into it like I was after my Grandmother died and my family didn't want to take care of me many years back.\n\nI became very distrustful and jaded about other people because if my family abandoned me, surely my foster parent wouldn't give a shit anymore than them right? -Unfortunately in my case I was absolutely right about that, HOWEVER the agency that placed me are filled with the most wonderful people who have helped me every step of the way.\n\nDon't expect to take a child into your life and expect everything to be alright off the bat, it'll likely be stressful at times, but believe me, the effort you're putting in will GREATLY pay off if/when you see your kid graduate middle/highschool and doubly so for college.\n\nJust figured I'd say something is all, I'm currently in the system myself, have been for 7 years, if you have any questions feel free to send me a PM!

They finally had two siblings placed with them, both boys, I believe around ages 8 and 12.

Kid was unapologetic, and said something like \u201cThat bitch deserved it.\u201d\n\nNeedless to say, friend called DHS to \u201creturn\u201d the kids to the system, and DHS had the boys out of the house by the next day. My friends never fostered anyone again, and have pretty strongly dissuaded others from getting involved, especially with kids over the age of about 4 or 5 years old. They said DHS does a lot to downplay the violence and behavioral problems of most of these kids. \n\nSad, too. The wife is an elementary school teacher and great with kids. ",

My Foster parents are well educated and can be part of really great discussion on general things. They also helped me with alot in my late teen years.\nHaving older Fosterparents isnt a problem, i would say its even better because you can give your foster child a more secure home.\n\nAlso one thing. If you gonna foster an older child. Something like 13-18. Dont force them into your family dynamic. Let them time to get into the new situation and try to change your dynamics a bit too, so that the foster child feels like it belongs and that it his family.\nI often struggeled with that part. I always felt a bit like a stranger when there was a family event going on with my foster parents or something.  \n\nStill the whole thing makes me wanna be an awesome dad or foster dad once if im old enough too.\n\nEdit:\nSorry for the wall of text i got caried away.

I mean, they\u2019re the ones who will be completely and permanently stuck with a baby that could turn out to be _absolutely anything_, while foster parents can always move onto the next one if a child doesn\u2019t work out.\n\nWhat\u2019s great about foster parenting is that you only pull the adoption trigger when you\u2019ve successfully bonded with a child, experienced the ins and outs of their nature, and truly know that you want to be their permanent family.\n\n**TL;DR:** No one needed your advice, and that was the most dickish use of \u2018please don\u2019t spread misinformation\u2019 ever.",

One of the girls staying with us decided to run away and I was home so I chased her and we ran into another subdivision and she took her hoodie and wrapped it around my neck and starting trying to choke me. I was maybe 13 and same for her. And so I just punched her in the face and she let go and ran and I went home.\n\n2. This was a weird one. He had an issue where if you upset him he would smear us poop on the walls. Well turns out that it was true and I never used the downstairs bathroom again.",
