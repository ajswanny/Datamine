Several of us also wore homemade togas and wild outfits that conformed to the standards, which pissed them off, but they couldn't do anything about it.

They pulled them aside and said something along the lines of \"you're a distraction to all the boys, how can they focus if they see your shoulders like this? They're just animals and through no fault of their own cannot focus on school if you dress like this.\" Bitch it is 100 degrees outside let the girls wear what they want. \n\nSomebody posted this story to Facebook, and the next day most of the guys of the school showed up in shorts rolled up to the groin, boxers, Speedos and tank tops just to prove a point to the administration. Nobody got in trouble because the teachers were just baffled, and when some of the teachers asked what was going on they congratulated us for doing something about it. After that day our principal sent an email out to every parent and student about the situation and apologized about how it was dealt with, and they will take into consideration the hot summer sun the next time they decide to dress code somebody.  The \"boys are animals\" and \"my shoulders are distrscting\" became a catchphrase for years after and is one of my favorite memories from high school. ",

The idea being they'd wear some combination of light/heavy with or without tights throughout the year, depending on temperature.\n\nThe vast vast majority of such schools also require boys to wear suit trousers, and **only** suit trousers. There are definitely some dress code schools who allow boys to wear shorts, however in most cases that's only for junior school. Once you reach 11 years old, or so, boys only have suit trousers as an option.\n\nClearly this is unfair and should be unacceptable in general, but especially so since the UK hit 34 degrees C in some places and it's very uncommon to have A/C.\n\nIf I was still of school age I'd certainly be joining them in wearing a skirt. And if I was a parent, I'd be telling the school in no uncertain terms that my kid would be wearing shorts or a skirt due to the heat, and I'd go to the newspapers about it if they complained.\n\nAnd on the hairy legs part, it'd be very inappropriate (I'd hope) for schools to impose that rule on girls. Or make comments about it. Bit creepy to tell under-16 girls to shave their legs IMO.

Though, a troublemaker you may have been, you probably were not the real problem. The problem are the self-righteous and those who see rules being bent and decide to take things too far.\n\n\nThis forces those in authority (parents, teachers, administrators) to enforce what seem like stupid rules with arbitrary sounding explanations. So, you want to wear your \"The Pist\" T-shirt openly at school. Sure, it is a real band, and sure, you have a right to express yourself, and if it weren't for the other 80 people in your class, the teachers and admins could give no less shits.\n\n\nBut, like 5 of your classmates are complaining to the faculty about how offensive you are, and complaining to their parents, and rallying to have you strung on a pole. Then, there are a handful of others who see your shirt, and decide they want to wear their shirt that has a giant penis on it with the caption, \"Fuck 'em right in the shit hole. They like it!\" because it's totally the same thing.\n\n\nSOooo, to avoid all of that, they have to pester folks about trivial bullshit, because it keeps them from having to deal with literal bullshit. A symptom of this just happens to be when you ask, \"why?\" the best answer most people can usually come up with is, \"because rules.\"\n\n\nedit: I just want to add that I have seen teachers and administrators over-reach their authority and make bad calls, but I just wanted to make the point that sometimes as teenagers, it can be difficult to see past your immediate circumstance and give others the benefit of the doubt.",

I was still a young buck working at this tech company, and one day I just decided to wear shorts because it was a hot day and I didn't see anything wrong with it.  It was one of the most awkward days I had at the company, because at the time nobody wore shorts and despite it not being a dress code issue, it was just not something that was done.  I got strange looks all day, and eventually one of my mentors (the guy who helped me get the job in the first place) said something to me about it and mentioned how I looked way too casual.  Over the next couple of years, wearing shorts in the summer actually became perfectly normal.  I don't know if I directly sparked that change, but it was interesting to see the change happen.  I'd like to think that in my ignorance, I unintentionally helped hundreds of people become more comfortable in the 100+ degree heat that we get here in the summer.",

There were huge rain storms, lasting for days, and this one morning my mom's car wouldn't start. Everything is packed away and dad's not home. So we hop in Old Trusty the truck and get to school ten minutes late. Ten minutes! We literally pulled up as the bell rang. So I rush in to the front office, cuz they won't let you in class without a pass. Mom said to just let them have it as \"unexcused\" if they don't believe me and she'll take care of it later because she was late to work as well.\n\nWell the office didn't like that. They said they wouldn't allow me in class unless my mom personally came in to show that I wasn't lying. I called my mom and she turned around and came in. She's short, mind you, but scary. She's half drenched at this point from the rain, and her ticked off meter is flairing. She didn't even make it to the office before she started yelling at people. \n\nBest part is that she got to point out that \"I'm late for a meeting with the White House because you assholes decided not to trust me! I could've been a few minutes late and it would have been fine! But no!!! I had to drive back here because you guys are more important than the fucking potus!\"\n\nShe works for a nonprofit and someone from the White House was Touring the place.
