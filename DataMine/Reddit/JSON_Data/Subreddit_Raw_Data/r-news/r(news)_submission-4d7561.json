Now I see someone has posted a [relevant bbc article](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-35918844), but then that makes me wonder, why not just lead with the BBC article and not this website, which seems pretty nebulous and buzz wordy.\n\nEven the link you gave to that comment doesn't have that much meat, probably because I take a more academic and sterile view of business. When someone says a companies structure is designed to avoid tax, this is opposed to what? What design should they have? A car is designed to avoid air resistance, because air resistance impedes performance. I don't get all moralistic and outraged because we didn't design cars like flat wooden blocks. Is the argument that companies have a moral imperative to design their structure to maximize taxes paid? To say they avoided tax implies there is some normative standard, when there isn't. \n\nUltimately the existence of shell companies is not the problem, focus instead on what is 'done' with the shell companies... like bribery, or avoiding election laws, or hiding funds that should otherwise be reported. Otherwise this comes across as hyperbole.",

But it most likely won't happen, if for no other reason then German politicans and officials aren't involved. (Which is not to say there aren't corrupt politicans in Germany. In the late 90's, it came out that for decades the biggest party in Germany has been taken millions of bribes for decades. Every single one of them. Seriously. Governors, president, chancellor, ministerers, secretaries, party officials. A attorney was also killed in a \"car crash\" after complaining about hinderance from the higher ups. That's how Merkel rose to power btw, she was the only one who wasn't corrupt.) \n\nI went a bit off topic there towards the end, but I hope you understand what I ment.",

Participants in a live conversation cannot leave the conversation to go watch a video or read a book between statements with anywhere near the ease of an online forum.\n \nIn most conversations there must be a link to the previous statement in order for the statement to be accepted - however tenuous the link. Humour makes these links easy, through hyperbole and analogy which can take a conversation in any possible direction in ever increasing steps.\n \nThe movement from humourous content back to serious content can happen equally as quickly, and must maintain a link only to the most recent content. This allows almost instantaneous transition in the following form:\n \n* Serious statement covering ABCDE.  \n* Humourous statement adding C with analogy F.\n* Humourous statement taking F to a hyperbolic extreme FGH.\n* Serious statement referring to H.\n \nWhere {ABCDE} are related topics, {CF} are linked in a non-obvious but funny way, {FGH} are extremist parallels in sequence .  A can have no relationship to H whatsoever, but in as little as 4 statements the conversation can seamlessly branch from one to another.\n \nThus we have the Principle Of Inertialess Humour Branching, or the IHB effect.",
