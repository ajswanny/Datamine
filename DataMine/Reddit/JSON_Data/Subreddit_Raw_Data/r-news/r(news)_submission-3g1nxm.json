And pretty soon, damn near everybody on every corner is your fucking enemy! And soon the neighborhood that you supposed to be policing... that's just occupied territory...\n\n> Okay, the point I'm making Carver is this: soldiering and policing ain't the same thing. And before we went and took the wrong turn and started up with these war games, the cop worked a beat. And he *learned* that post. And if there were things that happened up on that post whether they be a rape a robbery or a shooting, he had people helping him out there, feeding him information... But every time I come to you, my DEU sergeant, for information, to find out what's going on out there in them streets... All that came back was some bullshit. You had your stats, you had your arrests, you had your seizures. But don't none of that amount to shit when you talkin' 'bout protecting the neighborhood now, do it?\n\n>You know the worst thing about this so called \"drug war,\" to my mind...

The media attention came because of the backlash, not simply because of the original incident. If there's no backlash, it won't get the attention of an incident that creates a massive response. So it doesn't appear that this situation is at all apples-to-apples if all they did was expect the same response because of an incident report. Go out and make some noise about it, I'll be right there with you (virtually), but make an effort at least. I'm plenty outraged, this is bullshit. If the local community banded together and had a rally, a protest, or something, I have no doubt they'd start getting more attention.

There are no protests because they live in a conservative white area, and their community consists of people who have spent the last decades supporting and defending the police in these cases. They are not going to change their tune now and start protesting all of a sudden. Nothing has changed. Their community is being consistent. If they suddenly started protesting this one it would be very strange and different from their normal response, which is to defend the police, or remain silent.\n\nOne might instead ask, where was this family during the previous shootings?

I'm not saying that LEO (law enforcement officials) are all bad people.  Most of those that start in law enforcement actually believe they can change things.  About 2-3 years in they realize they cannot.  When a person first hires on with any department they go through a difficult hire-on process (as I feel it should be) that consists of drug tests, numerous interviews, physical tests, polygraphs and pysch evaluations.  However, this is the ONLY time LEOs are required to go through these evaluations.  Ever wondered why there are obese LEOs? Because they were never required to take the physical test again.  Why does this matter? Once an LEO is hired that is it, there are no follow up exams or questions.  \n\nOur LEOs endure a lot of hate and sadness. I would say that many suffer from undiagnosed PTSD and depression. Knowing that when you are in uniform people avoid you takes a mental toll on a person.  An officer will find their first dead body that has been decomposing for a week and the only support they recieve is from a supervisor.  That \"support\" consists of the following question: \"hey Smith, you okay after seeing your first gross dead body?\" Smith replies a simple \"yeah\" and all is okay with the department.  \n\nLEO need to be \"retested\" and their mental AND physical capabilites need to be re-evaluated every so often .  An LEO that was mentally qualified 2 years ago may no longer be mentally stable to do the same job duties.  I would hope there would be a plan in place to help these LEOs but seeing how we treat our veterans I highly doubt that would happen.  By no means do I feel we should discard the LEOs that are no longer mentally fit to serve the public but there needs to be more support and resources to help the mentallity of our LEOs.  I just wish across our society we would think more of people that sought out mental health improvement rather than the stygma that those that do are weak.  LEOs should feel it is acceptable to get help with mental health issues. Hell, I'd say departments should make it manditory that EVERY officer see a counselor/pyschiatrist/pyshcologist once a month just to eliminate the \"you're a pussy\" teasing since everyone has to go. \n\n Our LEO have just become too desensitized to humans and need some \"maintenance\" in the mental health department.   They should also be required to maintain the same physical attributes as they had when they were first hired but thats another discussion for another day. ",

    "body": "10 years ago when I was around 20, there was this guy who was a friend of a friend that called me constantly asking me if I could find any drugs. I didn't give him my number, and he was pretty aggressive about it. I always just told him no because I never sold drugs.\n\nHe called a few times a day if I didn't pick up. I wasn't very confrontational so I didn't straight up tell him to fuck off but told him no everytime. I remember one time he asked if I could find 100 pills of ecstasy. \n\nOne time I was on the phone with my friend who I got pot from and got a beep from another call, and lo and behold it was him asking if I could get anything at all. I told him my friend was going to be here in 45 minutes and to be here at the same time and he could get an eighth a pot for 50 bucks. \n\nSo this guy shows up 45 minutes late with his friend(the undercover). I give him the bag because my friend had already came and left, expecting me to get the money for him cause he had to leave. \n\nLong story short, a few weeks later the same thing happens, except I tell him to go meet him himself since he kept me waiting so long before. He insist he picks me up and we go get it together. It's from the same guy as the first time and we go to meet him. He insist I take the money and go get it from the guy. They drop me off back at my house after.\n\nA few months later I get a knock on my door and it's a policeman at my door. He says that they have recovered property of mine that I need to sign for. So I'm all happy wondering what it is and as I'm walking to his car in my driveway someone radios him and says \"thats him!\", and I get tackled.\n\nIm like wtf and asked what im being arrested for, and he says that I know I'm a drug dealer. I get thrown into a small jail at the police station and one by one, my friends start getting put into the cell with me. \n\nFour of them were in a car together when they got pulled over by a team of 4 with mask and shotguns yelling orders.\n\nWe eventually figure out we got setup by this guy we know. To this day it still blows my mind because they didn't even bust our dealer (who was small time teenager anyways wow), and we all get arrested for drug trafficking for middle manning 25-50$ pot deals.\n\nI tried to tell my public attorney to get the phone records to argue some kind of extortion ( i dont know), but they didnt care enough to make it happen apparently. \n\nI ended up doing 3-4 months of jailtime and 2 years of probation, having to pay thousands in fines and cost. Glad I didn't get shot for it though.\n\n\nTLDR: Arrested for middle manning 75$ worth of pot over 3 stings",

In reality, only a tiny number have risen to media prominence. \n\nYep, this is it. The fact that there wasn't any video has hurt their efforts, as has the absence of any local protests. \n\nRace *is*, I suspect, the best explanation for the second part--why the locals in Seneca haven't protested or rioted.

The only report available to the media at this time is the marijuana possession charge which is a separate report. \n\nEdit:   Let me be clear, this idea that the police officer did not report the shooting is insane.  He reported it immediately to his superiors and SLED.  From that point on SLED takes over the entire investigation to include the report.  The officer and the entire department is prohibited from talking to anybody about the incident and all questions are referred to SLED.  The chief has stuck his neck out there providing as much detail as he has.  \n\nSLED has said nothing, as is their policy until their investigation is complete.  So the only real source of information is the family's attorney, whose only interest in the case is an eventual payday from civil litigation. \n\nHomicide investigations can take years before an arrest warrant is issued.  It hasn't even been two weeks.  Give the system time to run its course.  Watch carefully but understand that the initial sources of information are incredibly biased because they have the most to gain.  Don't forget that the officer in Ferguson was exonerated by both the grand jury and the follow-up independent DOJ investigation and report.  \n\n\n",

There's no perpetually frustrated, simmering undercurrent of rage against chronic injustice that this kind of incident will set off in those communities.  \nI have no doubt that white middle class assholes are already crowing ''You see?

That's worth murdering our children?*\n\nI couldn't have said it better, myself.\n\nJust remember (and I know you know this,) there are so many other interests involved. From the smallest interest to the largest, there *are* interests involved. Those interests compete with one another, and, in the end, terrible things  happen, that seem (or often are) inhumane.\n\nIt's just really, really easy to look at these things from the perspective of, *Oh, police killed someone again, wow...*\n\nAnd even if that's okay or even correct (even if it's true that police do seem to kill innocent people too much), I just feel like we have to be careful about taking sides, or which side we take if we do take one. I'm always inclined to jump to the victim's side, but the truth is that a lot of people love playing victim, and do it very well. I'm not referring to this case in particular, but if the police were seriously out there murdering people in the streets by the hundreds in every city, there *would* be much more outcry. While you may be \"more likely to die at the hands of a peace officer than a terrorist in the USA\" (quoted because I have no source, but have heard this many times,) it's not like hundreds or thousands of citizens die every day at the hands of police. (Hell, I could be wrong about that and I'm open to sources/information if I am -- I'd believe hundreds, maybe, but not thousands.)\n\nHopefully I've made sense. I've had a couple of beers :P I'm all about \"policing the police,\" but let's be careful about where we put our blame, and how we choose to put it there.\n\n**EDIT** Again, I'm a bit tipsy, so I don't even know why I replied to you in particular. Just so you know, /u/Quartus4, I just wanted to share my thoughts and I agree with 96% or more of what you said :P",

I remember not too long ago here in Westchester not far from where I live a black veteran's life alert bracelet went off, the cops showed up and when he said that he was fine and wouldn't let them in the cops kicked down the door and shot and killed him and of course a grand jury cleared them of all wrongdoing.

I'm going to leave race out of it. In the first, there's a short story in the local media, the family grieves, receives visitors, talks amongst their circle of close acquaintances, but really does nothing else. The community shows support and then moves on with their lives.\n\nIn the second, however, things are different. Immediately following the incident, someone sets up a \"Justice for victim 2\" FB page, and starts a Twitter campaign. That night, there is a candlelight vigil in a community area. The next day, 25 people show up outside the police station with signs and chant through megaphones. A change.org petition is circulated and gains traction. The FB page goes viral and more people who would be unaware start showing support. Tweets are suddenly retweeted by celebrities and people who have an audience. Within a week the crowds outside the police department swell from 25 to 50 to 200 to more. \n\nIn one situation, the media isn't going to dig deeper, but in the other, the media can't ignore the response. For all the hate that SJWs get on here, some of these situations would not have gained as much traction if people who weren't involved decided they wanted to lend a hand to the effort. But if there is no effort in the first place, who is going to take it upon themselves to publicize injustice if those intimately involved don't start the movement. \n\nSure, there's plenty of race-baiting in the media, it sells. But that doesn't mean that they're not going to cover an issue that gains massive support. But if you want to get that massive support, you have to get out there and make noise. If you want attention to your cause, you have to make an effort to DRAW attention to your cause. Blaming this situation solely on the fact that \"he was white\" ignores the fact that the deaths in the black community became a rallying-cry for others to get involved and lend an effort to the cause. I haven't seen one indication that any of this happened in this case, that any effort was made by the community to FORCE this issue. And that's sad, because there are a lot of people, myself definitely included, who would lend their support",

Conservatism is often described in textbooks as representing slow change, but as we all know conservatives often actively opposes change or want it to go back to the way it was before. To be a liberalist, not to be confused with a liberal; the opposite of conservative, you don't have to be a conservative. I think they all commonly just fall under the same category in the US today due to your two party system. I'm a liberal socialist, and understanding the core of both socialism and liberalism makes me see the beauty of both of the ideologies principles, and where they both can, and have, gone wrong.
