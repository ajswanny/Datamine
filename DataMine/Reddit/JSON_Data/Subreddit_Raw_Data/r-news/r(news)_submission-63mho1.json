They were more enthusiastic about getting out and voting, at least in the right swing states. When Hillary tried running again and it was almost assumed she'd take it, they gravitated towards the troll, the guy who pissed off the left the way they felt they had been pissed off for the last eight years.

Was critical thinking ever cool in america?

He believes what people say, in the intentions they tell him. I wasn't surprised at all when he asked me to help to move some furniture he wanted to from another flat in my town, then ditched me at the appointment we made. Of course i called him several times about his whereabouts, he didn't answer the phone. Some days later (we live in the same appartement complex) I confronted him and asked him about his whereabouts, he straight told me that he is a reliable person. I did not mention his reliability at any times, just asked him where he was and that we had an appointment.\n\nNot to mention he wants (more) social services and money from the state, despite having some money on his bank account and working illegal. Still immigrants are to blame, not his savings and posessions for not getting more money from the state.\n\nSry for the rant, TLDR: these kind of people think declarations of intent weigh more than actions.\n\n\u20ac: some spelling",

Religion for sure, it basically ingrains a need to believe things without facts and to dismiss facts when presented that don't align with your beliefs. The republican party in general has been on an anti intellectual kick for quite some time, and trump and all of his supporters seem like a direct result of this. Plus older people from the \"greatest\" generation may be taking that literally, and thus a bit full of themselves/their opinions. Society also seems to be giving almost everyone the belief that their opinion is important, needs to be heard and shared by everyone, via social media and reality TV. ",
