That's the only type of protesting they care about.  Sure some things you can't get away from (only internet in town) but you can do things like instead of paying them $12 a month for \"modem rental\" buy a supported one online for $60.  Switch phone carries or better; if you don't use your phone much go with a pay to use phone service.  Stop visiting their websites or buying their products.

We're too reliant on our representatives..we can't say our democracy is broken and still rely on them as much as we have in the past. Our voice is supposed to be heard through them, but if it's not lets let them hear it directly from us. All it takes is one giant uprising to get what we want. After that it's they hear us getting rowdy again and don't want a repeat of the past. The problem lies in having enough people wanting the same thing, and it affecting them enough to make such an uprising happen. I imagine it needs to happen periodically to sustain a healthy democracy. We're not too good at learning from the past and I think the government has forgotten what it's truly like to be fearful of its people. With that said, I'm drunk and probably on a no fly list now.",

First we'll get packages but they'll cost less combined and Comcast or whatever other big company will say, \"Wow look at how fast our internet is without net neutrality!\" Then the public will eventually adjust to the change and accept a world without neutrality. Then in 5 - 10 years, Comcast will slowly but surely increase the price of these packages and decrease internet speed, asking customers if they would like to opt out for a fast lane. By now, enough people will have forgotten the old, free internet that they're campaigning to have less costly packages and faster internet again. Eventually, if Comcast were to want it, they could devolve this into no more than an extortion scheme for those who devoted themselves to the fast Internet.

For removing the Title II for ISPs and the accompanying NN that comes with it, the FCC must show that Title II was significantly harming the ISPs to the point of their destruction. The FCC may have difficulty doing this because the ISPs have been posting healthy profits under Title II, and are still investing in their infrastructure to continue to serve their markets, and enter new ones.  Both of those factors combined put the FCC in a bit of bind legally as it is hard to argue that Title II and NN are harming the ISPs. What the FCC could argue, which most likely won't hold much water, is that Title II is preventing the ISPs from maximizing revenue from their existing infrastructure.\n\n\n",

Right now it's a public utility (thanks Obama), which means that it's regulated by special commissions that make sure companies don't go too crazy with their monopolies. Another utility company is PG&E on the west coast\u2014they own pretty much all of the gas, electric, water, and sewage lines out here, which is \"normal\" to some extent because they're regulated as a utility. The reason this type of monopoly is allowed is that infrastructure maintenance (for sewage, electricity, internet, etc) is difficult and expensive, so the government lets companies have monopolies but keeps a close eye on them.\n\nSo basically what I'm saying is that it could be argued that high-speed broadband internet has become so essential to us (economically, personally, etc) that depriving people of that (whether in a discriminatory fashion or not) could be seen as anticonstitutional (I don't know specifically how, I'm not a lawyer).",

The agency should then dig through these comments and take it into account while passing its rule. The APA requires they make a public response to all (meaningful) comments. \nHowever where problems arise is that the agency has the discretion as go what is or is not meaningful and the agency also has the discretion to go completely against the comments. \n\nNow the argument that we change agency law could be made. We do know that the primary difference between the late justice Scalia and Justice Gorsuch is their belief in agency power. Historically Scalia had given very broad powers to agencies as arms of the executive but Gorsuch seems to have a much more restrictive view for agency power. We don't really know what will happen after this but aside from a major change in the interpretation of Article 1 section 1 of the US constitution or a major ruling dealing with the validity of the current APA neither of which would be dependent on these comments and calls. \n\nBy all means still do it, still harass your congress men, write your comments, but do know its not something the court will have any power to control ",
