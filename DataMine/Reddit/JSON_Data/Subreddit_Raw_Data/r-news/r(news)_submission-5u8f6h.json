It's the perfect time to start teaching them about this as they start pulling in their first pay checks and open their first bank accounts.\nThis is not going to stick or hold much value in the long run for students when they're at an age where their parents pay for everything and none of them even have a bank account (younger than high school). They don't care about taxes or loans because that doesn't apply to them at that age and it's over most of their heads. \n\nEdit: I've read more comments and (surprise) it seems like no one has actually read this article in full and are making assumptions that this is the first time that students will be learning any sort of basic financial skills. To clarify, this program is not about teaching basic skills which are already taught at the elementary level (I learned how to count money in grade 1 back in 1996, they also teach basic budgeting skills in the next few grades). This program is about much more advanced skills like taxes and mortgages which are not currently taught in Ontario schools. \n",

The amount of surprised looks I got when said, \"Let's split the bill\"... haha \n\nEnded up in a relationship with a lady that said, \"I am shocked that you don't pay for me on our dates. Men are supposed to pay.\" I laughed and said, \"I'd be broke if I did that.\" She stayed in it for a year before realizing that I wasn't going to pay for her student loans. She told me she had too many loans and was planning on going back to school, and that she needed to find someone that was rich.\n\nIt's shocking what some people think.",
