Yes, the results sound encouraging either way.  This is why we have to do academic research trials such as this one at USC and not just haphazardly give people stem cells.  There are so many bullshit stem cell scam artists out there that I get hopping mad when I hear that one of my patients got suckered into some $50k treatment of IV stem cells by some quack who has to ship them to D.R. or Mexico to perform the \"procedure.\"\n\nFor anyone considering IV stem cell therapy, just think about this:  If you are making stem cells already and those stem cells have not fixed your problem, then it makes no sense that giving you a bunch more stem cells will help you.  Don't do it.  Look for a bona fide research program at a university or other truly academic center with a reputable research team, not some whack-job \"doctor\" who has a cure for everything.

Advanced medical science is godliness. The grey area comes when you have to take a new life, one free of sin, and sacrifice it to save an old life. The moral question is always \"where does life begin\" because almost all religions hold all human life to be sacred (thou shalt not kill). I personally think that it is up to the parent and the parent only. If they choose to \"sin\" by aborting their fetus, then as good humans we have no choice but to use the unwanted fetus to help others. Then the parent can seek forgiveness for their \"sin\". (Obviously I don't think anything but a late stage abortion is a sin and even then, medically necessary ones absolutely aren't.)",

One could just as likely use that reasoning to say that a 20 year old could become a 21 year old or a heart donor and then justify taking the 20 year old's heart because somebody society values more, needs it.\n\nThe question at hand is whether or not a human embryo is a person.  It's not a yes or no question, but involves what defines a person and has serious ramifications for all people. For instance, if one includes the requirement that a person must be viable, there are many people who without medical assistance and devices would not be a person.  If you include that a person must be able to reason or be sentient, there are many mentally challenged and also elderly people who just became non-person.\n\nIt is a complex issue that philosophers/ethicists have be wrestling with, not just theologians. \n\nYou may not have a religious persuasion, but how the definition is ultimately understood and defined can have a major impact in ways society doesn't even think about today.\n",

If you're willing to apply the term \"murder\" to a 6-week abortion, on some level you're making the assertion the 'moral weight' of an embryo and person are sufficiently equivalent.\n\nCompare that to the burning building situation.
