The attack was the deadliest single incident in the Syrian conflict so far.\n\n> UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon told the UN Security Council that he believed the attack constituted a war crime.

In some of the most graphic footage, dozens of bodies, including many small children and babies, were seen laid out in rows on the floors of clinics and mosques, and on streets in Muadhamiya, Ein Tarma, Zamalka and nearby areas.\n\n> The Syrian government and military denied being behind the 21 August attack, describing the allegations made by Western powers as \"false and completely baseless\" and challenging them to present incontrovertible proof.\n\nhttp://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-23927399\n\n**BBC News - Syria 'chemical attack': What we know (April 6 2017)**\n\n> At least 80 people have been killed in a suspected chemical attack on the rebel-held town of Khan Sheikhoun in north-western Syria.\n\n> Hundreds suffered symptoms consistent with reaction to a nerve agent after what the opposition and Western powers said was a Syrian government air strike on the area on Tuesday morning.\nThe Syrian military denied using any chemical agents, while its ally Russia said an air strike hit a rebel depot full of chemical munitions.\n\n> Has Sarin been used in Syria before?\n\n> The Syrian government was accused by Western powers of firing rockets filled with Sarin at several rebel-held suburbs of the capital Damascus in August 2013, killing hundreds of people.\n\n> President Bashar al-Assad denied the charge, blaming rebel fighters, but he did subsequently agree to destroy Syria's declared chemical arsenal.\n\nhttp://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-39500947\n\n**Edit 3**: \n\nThe sheer number of people saying \"things were different 4 years ago!\" has dramatically gone down after Edit 2.\n\n**Edit 4**:\n\nA few responses to my original post before the edits (I won't include usernames):\n\n> * Was there chemical attacks going on at that time... shit changes as time goes on stop trying to put old tweets up here and make them apply to the situation today.

Didn't Russia work with Syria to get rid of it all in 2013? \n- What does the end game look like for Syria and Russia? Presumably Syria has to make peace with the rebel groups at some point so Russia can go home. Does this new situation help or hinder that from happening? \n- Why was this attack so blatant? There was a second attack on a care facility after the first. Lots of pictures of dead children. Who does that help or hinder? \n- Donald Trump is now a war president. There is (at least the appearance of) conflict with Russia. Who does that help or hinder? \n- The Russian Times is reporting that Russian troops were told to get out of the way. By whom and when? \n  \nAnd, the question I think is the most important: \n  \n- *How long after the cessation of hostilities can we expect a thawing with Russia and eventual lifting of sanctions? Four months? Six months?* ",

They know we aren't happy, and that we're willing to use physical violence to enforce our will.\n\nCould it spiral out of control into WWIII? I mean, shit, sure. But so can almost any other defense of our interests.\n\nFor the record I *abhor* Trump and the people around him and think he's a fucking miserable excuse for a President, was probably in contact with the Russians during the election, and that we'd all be better off if he was impeached, but this move in and of itself isn't unreasonable.\n\nSometimes military force is warranted. This is one of those times, and the amount used was proportionate.\n\nAlso, as an aside, if you want decent coverage, find some actual diplomats, academics, etc. in various fields of expertise on social media and follow them. They get the info faster, are more accurate, and generally have a more nuanced perspective on things than any news organization that you can think of.

This world in arms is not spending money alone. It is spending the sweat of its laborers, the genius of its scientists, the hopes of its children. This is not a way of life at all in any true sense. Under the clouds of war, it is humanity hanging on a cross of iron.\u201d -Dwight D. Eisenhower\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\nEdit: Thanks for the gold. So, I'm receiving a lot of comments saying Eisenhower was a hypocrite because he supported war, or saying that when he said that he was not taking into account the war economy or the benefits that a society gets from the army or the related industry. First, I think some of you are falling into an [ad hominem argument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_hominem), he may be an hypocrite but he's pointing something that is kind of true, so we should not dismiss a valid point just because of the person saying it. \n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nThat takes me into my second point. How the hell some of you say that he, \"a five-star general in the United States Army during World War II\" and President, didn't understand war? To me, at least the way I interpret that quote, he's talking from an humanist point of view, a romantic point of view, he's talking about the cost of war from a human being point of view. Yeah, war economy exists, war pushes progress, it creates jobs, but with that, because of that, \"humanity hanging on a cross of iron\". I know a [Leviathan](http://bit.ly/2b6bXCP) is a necessity, but as conscious human beings (that as far as we know are alone in the universe), we live under a sad condition. ",

The call to strike a military target in a country backed by a power whose end goals are to see the downfall of the West was seemingly made on a whim, before all of the facts have come out, by a guy frequently misled by his gut feeling, who has rarely gone to intelligence briefings, whose advisors are in chaos, and is not even at the white house at the moment. \n\nI wouldn't be surprised if it came out that it was an idea devised during commercial breaks of the Masters.
