    "body": "As far as hunting in America goes, please go buy a duck stamp! If you don't know what the duck stamp or waterfowl stamp is, you should watch the animal planet doc called \"million dollar duck.\" Even if you don't hunt, you can buy a stamp and it's a super awesome way to help keep the conservation going. With less and less hunters, we need more people willing to buy the stamp just for the good it does. 98\u00a2 of your donated dollar has to go into the program and cannot be spent anywhere else. It's one of the greatest federal programs we've ever had and we can't lose it or we lose acres of land that is dedicated to the wild animals in the area, especially the waterfowl that use these areas as stopping points and breeding areas. Forgive me for having shit grammar and not the best at explaining things. Look this shit up yo! \n\nEdit: thanks for all the upvotes! Someone should do a post about this on whatever subreddit it fits in. Get the word out to those who don't know about it. ",

    "body": "Just a reminder that preserves in Africa hire these people to do this. They let big-game hunters pay incredibly large sums, and they usually have them hunt an animal that they were going to have to put down anyway due to old age. These sorts of hunts are very beneficial for the preserve and allow them to provide better care for animals. So, news like this probably hurts animals in those preserves by decreasing the amount of big game hunters that come out.\n\nhttp://www.conservationmagazine.org/2014/01/can-trophy-hunting-reconciled-conservation/\n\n>According to a 2005 paper by Nigel Leader-Williams and colleagues in the Journal of International Wildlife Law and Policy the answer is yes. Leader-Williams describes how the legalization of white rhinoceros hunting in South Africa motivated private landowners to reintroduce the species onto their lands. As a result, the country saw an increase in white rhinos from fewer than one hundred individuals to more than 11,000, even while a limited number were killed as trophies.\n\n>In a 2011 letter to Science magazine, Leader-Williams also pointed out that the implementation of controlled, legalized hunting was also beneficial for Zimbabwe\u2019s elephants. \u201cImplementing trophy hunting has doubled the area of the country under wildlife management relative to the 13% in state protected areas,\u201d thanks to the inclusion of private lands, he says. \u201cAs a result, the area of suitable land available to elephants and other wildlife has increased, reversing the problem of habitat loss and helping to maintain a sustained population increase in Zimbabwe\u2019s already large elephant population.\u201d\n\nOr, you know, ignore this because of the angry mob you've whipped yourself into.",

For a good ten minutes the man stands frozen - thinking of nothing else but being trampled.\n\nEventually the elephant turns and walks away.\n\nFor years after, the man often remembers and ponders the events of that day. Years later the man is walking through the zoo with his son. As they approach the elephant enclosure, one of the elephants turns and walks over to where they are standing at the rail. It stares at him and the man can't help wondering if this is the same elephant. The man climbs tentatively over the railing and makes his way into the enclosure. He walks right up to the elephant and stares back in wonder. Suddenly the elephant wraps its trunk around one of the man's legs and swings him wildly back and forth along the railing, instantly killing him.\n\nProbably not the same elephant then.",

Take the Arctic tundra, for example, where several mosquito species are particularly abundant and provide food for migratory birds. If mosquitoes were eliminated, the number of birds in the area could drop by more than half [source: Fang]. Some scientists predict a similar fate awaits many fish species around the globe, which would need to adapt their diet to survive. This scenario would be particularly difficult for specialized predators, such as the mosquitofish. In fact, if mosquitoes were to disappear, the other insects and fish that feed on them would dwindle in number, which could cause a ripple effect throughout the food chain [source: Misra].\n\n**Edit:**\n\nSo far, the main suggestions are:\n\n1.  Transport all mosquitos to the Arctic and let the fish go to town\n\n2.  Kill only the species here and just leave the Arctic ones\n\n3.  Fuck those fish, I don't give a fuck, it will be totally worth it.\n\n**Edit 2:** Many people seem to think that my comment is an indication that I have an opinion one way or the other on whether mosquitos should be eradicated. It's not. It's just a statement that the whole \"LITERALLY EVERY MOSQUITO ON EARTH COULD DROP DEAD AND IT WOULD HAVE ZERO EFFECT ON THE WORLD!!!\" just isn't true.",

Some species are being hunted faster than they can reproduce.\n\n2) There is no evidence that trophy hunting also helps reduce the prevalence of poaching.\n\n3) A strong and strict legal and structural framework is needed to ensure that trophy hunting actually supports conservation. These African countries are among the most corrupt in the world, so this framework does not exist, and it also allows high-paying hunters to hunt unethically (ie Cecil the Lion).\n\n4) The funds received from trophy hunting are often diverted from their purpose of conservation (due to the point above).\n\n* http://democrats-naturalresources.house.gov/imo/media/doc/Missing%20the%20Mark.pdf\n\n* https://africageographic.com/blog/missing-mark-african-trophy-hunting-fails-show-consistent-conservation-benefits/\n\n* https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/14/us/politics/trophy-hunting-fees-do-little-to-help-threatened-species-report-says.html\n\n* http://www.cbsnews.com/news/trophy-huntings-contribution-to-conservation-not-much/\n\n* http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2015/11/151715-conservation-trophy-hunting-elephants-tusks-poaching-zimbabwe-namibia/",

In many  parts of the world indigenous and local  communities have chosen to use trophy  hunting as a strategy for conservation of  their wildlife and to improve sustainable  livelihoods. \n\n>...\n\n>Concern is frequently expressed that trophy  hunting is driving declines of iconic African  large mammals such as elephants, rhinos  and lions. While there is evidence for a small  number of populations that unsustainable  trophy hunting has contributed to local  declines (e.g. Loveridge et al., 2007, Packer  et al., 2009, 2011), it is not a significant  threat to any of these species and is  typically a negligible or minor threat to  African wildlife populations (Lindsey, 2015).  \n\n>The primary causes of population declines  of the large mammals subject to trophy  hunting, such as the African Elephant,  African Buffalo, White Rhino, Black Rhino,  African Wild Dog and Hartmann\u2019s Mountain  Zebra are habitat loss and degradation,  competition with livestock, illegal or  uncontrolled poaching for meat and trade  in animal products (ivory, horn, etc.),  and retribution killing for human-wildlife  conflict (Schipper et al., 2008). For Lions  specifically, the most important causes of  population declines are indiscriminate killing  in defense of human life and livestock,  habitat loss, and prey base depletion  (usually from poaching) (Bauer et al., 2015).\n\n>**For all of these species, as the case studies  note, well-managed trophy hunting can  indeed promote population recovery,  protection, and maintenance of habitat  (see Figure 3).**",

In many of these countries that habitat has to directly compete with the local agriculture industries etc. In essence the very development of these nations will drive the extinction of many of these species, much in the same way the development of the United States led to the extirpation of Wolves and Grizzly Bears in the lower 48. The days of Westerners dictating to Africans how they should develop their countries are thankfully long gone. The question remains: how do we create a situation where the preservation of these habitats is conducive to the continued economic development of the African continent? Trophy hunting isn't 100% of the answer but i think it can play a important role when regulated properly. ",

But, until Richard summed it up quite neatly, I never really understood my own aversions to doing this: \"It's like having someone else write in your diary,\" he said.

These cartoons are my \"children,\" of sorts, and like a parent, I'm concerned about where they go at night without telling me.

However to trademark something it must be new and distinguishable (which Dolphin Taxi probably wouldn't be). It can even happen that a company loses a trademark because it becomes \"genericized\" if people start using it to refer to everything of that type.

I feel that Calvin and Hobbes contributed more fundamentally to a particular generation than Mickey Mouse has to all of his generations spanned.  One IP is about capitalism, the other is about its own message.  For a peek at the potential dilution of C&H, look no further than \"Calvin pisses on stupid thing\" stickers. If Watterson had a message he thought would benefit his readers, then sacrificing wealth to preserve its integrity seems more selfless to me.\n\nTLDR; Nuh-uuuh!
