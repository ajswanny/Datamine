It\u2019s also so people like **YOU** will find any reason to defend their actions. **YOU** are part of the problem. **YOU** let them get away with killing US citizens.

The cop was literally trying to humiliate him. There's no reason for the \"crawl toward me\" command. None. If the officer couldn't tell the kid was drinking and terrified, he shouldn't be given responsibility to carry a gun. If he wasn't guilty of murder, the PD that hired him was.\n\n----\n\n\n\nEdit: I hesitate - a lot - to edit a comment I made that blows up like this. There have been fifty replies in an hour or so. But I'm going to. Because I think there's something important to say.\n\nThat kid was crying in fear. I dunno how to explain that feeling to someone who's never experienced it. I was once pulled over for being a suspect in a hit and run (I was not the person they were after, but I drove a similar truck). The cop pulled his gun on me, because when I pulled over, I pulled into a parking lot and flipped my truck around to face him, rather than just the side of the road. Stupid move on my part, but it was enough to put suspicion for the hit and run on me.  He thought I was gearing up to ram him.\n\nI followed his instructions to the letter, announced/asked about every movement I was doing prior to doing it, and I was terrified. I was sober and crying. As a grown man. I understood that a cop pulling a weapon is not a simple matter. I'd had guns pointed at me, but not by a cop. The cop was the scariest instance, by far. \n\nAnd you know what? That cop *cried too*. When he finally got over to my vehicle, ran the plates, checked my license, etc? He was balling. He *was ready to kill me* and relieved that he didn't have to. My license was even suspended at the time, he let me go home. Even hugged me. \n\nI say all this to say two things: First, not all cops are like this, thank god. And second: fear is a crazy powerful thing, but a cop should be trained to handle this much. This cop in the OP was not. That should be seen as a failing of his department no matter what the outcome of this trial was.\n",

Whether someone accidentally held the gun the wrong way, purposefully pointed it out the window, or even if the person who saw it just mistook what they saw, I can't find any info on any of that. Bottom line is, somebody called the police.\n\nAnd then we have the video.\n\nSo, I don't know much about police procedure, or protocol, or any of that, but...during that whole time that killer cop on an ego trip was barking orders at two innocent people, couldn't he have just said something like, oh, I don't know...\n\n\"We heard reports of a gun pointed out your window.\"\n\nAnd maybe Daniel would have said something like...\n\n\"It's an airsoft rifle. Nobody aimed it out the window on purpose.\"\n\nAnd then, holy shit, like magic, the situation is diffused.\n\nBut no, let's humiliate a man before murdering him, that solves it.\n\nJesus fucking Christ.\n\nIMPORTANT EDIT: Turns out the cop holding the rifle WAS NOT the cop shouting orders. This changes a lot. In fact, re-watching it in that context, this is more a case of a communication breakdown and incompetent police than it is about one psychotic, schizo cop. It goes from a cop shooting a man for complying as best he can, to one cop shouting confusing orders, a drunk man trying to comply, and another cop with an itchy trigger watching for his hands to go behind his back. Thing is, when you're told to crawl across the floor drunk with your legs crossed and your hands raised, you're probably going to fucking stumble. This is just tragic, and is a stronger case for better police training than anything. Context is important.",

The officer that shot was probably going on instinct as much as the victim was when he reached behind his back to pull up his pants. The Sgt that was barking the confusing orders is the most guilty and deserves more blame, but everyone is focusing on the shooter, probably because they aren't aware that it was the Sgt giving the orders.",

It's the More Perfect podcast called \"Mr. Graham and the Reasonable Man.\" You can listen to it to get the whole story but basically juries are instructed to consider the following when it comes to police shootings:\n\n\n\nWhat would a reasonable person do *in that moment*?\n\n\nAnd that's where the problem lies. The jury is to ignore everything that came before and everything that came after. Ignore the fact that the person who was gunned down was obeying contradicting commands. Ignore the fact that the cop could have gone up to the suspect and cuffed him. Ignore ALL OF THAT. \n\nJust focus on that split second moment and ask, would a reasonable man make the decision the cop made? Of course they would. But you can't and shouldn't ignore all of the facts before the moment. That's fucking nuts. That rule is absolutely bullshit. And it's why so many cops get off. That rule needs to be changed\n\nEdit: [Here's](https://www.policeone.com/media-relations/articles/243531006-Understanding-police-use-of-force-Right-vs-reasonable/) an article written just last year that shows the way the police interpret this rule. It practically gives them any justification for murdering citizens because they can claim a vague threat \"In the moment\"",

Someone linked it further down the thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/PublicFreakout/comments/7iie3f/police_officer_orders_man_to_crawl_man_crawls/\n\nYou're right he was totally getting off on it. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\"If you make another mistake there's a very strong chance you will be shot\" \n\n\"Did I tell you to move young man? Your job is to obey.\" \n\n\"Young lady, shut up.\" \n\n&nbsp;\n\nNot to mention the ridiculous instructions. He was fucking lying on the ground with his legs crossed and his fingers interlaced. Walk up to him and cuff him. They tell his girlfriend to put her hands up and crawl towards them. She can't crawl. Her hands are in the air. She has to walk towards him on her knees. Try doing that across the floor. If she had fallen he would have shot her first. \n\n\n\nThe guy is supposed to keep his legs crossed and push himself up to his knees. Naturally, he unconsciously uncrosses them so he can balance. The entire time, the cop is screaming at him and telling him he's going to shoot him. He tells him if he thinks he's going to fall he's better fall on his face. What? Do you know how difficult it is to fall without your hand shooting out? It's involuntary. \n\nHis shorts reach past his knees, so when he's scooting across the floor, they are falling down. He goes to pull the shorts up and the guy shoots him like six times. Remember, the cop told him he \"better not fucking trip\" so he pulls his shorts up because they are about to trip him. I don't see a way he could get out of that situation alive. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nI can't believe they didn't show the jury this. It's murder. \n\nEdit: I'm reading that they *did* show the video to the jury? Then how the fuck did they render that verdict? Who the hell can watch that footage and not see a cop on a power trip itching to use his weapon on someone?\n\nEdit 2: edited to fix link.\n\nEdit 3: I am being told that the jury saw an *edited* version of the footage, that omits everything from where they exit the hotel room. \n\nEdit 4: Scratch that. The jury did see video of the entire incident from the time they left the hotel room to the time he was shot, it's just that they didn't see the full 18 minutes of video.

These people are treated like God, and cannot be held accountable.\n\nI retrained a retired Texas drug enforcement officer at work, and the guy told me all sorts of awful stories. Like that his chief told him \"if your FBI rights violation folder isn't 6 inches thick, you aren't doing your job\". \n\nI ended up quitting my job because they kept sending me down there and I kept seeing more and more sadistic behavior. \n\nThe worst example was an old man who parked an 18 wheeler where another driver wanted to park, so the other driver smashes the old man's legs in the door, then fights him, then comes back and attacks him again. This time the old man got lucky, and the attacker ended up curled up on the ground.\n\nWell, some self righteous A-hole comes up and accuses the old man of being the attacker, points a gun at his head and tells \"stop or Ill blow your F*cking head off!\"\n\nWell, the police come and they take the word of the attacker and gunman like it's the word of God, and threaten the old man and accuse him of being the attacker.\n\nThis happened in the middle of a truck stop and like half the truck stop collectively freaks out at the officer, almost all of them being from out of state.\n\nThis is like 1% of the stuff I saw down there, and was even once locked in a bathroom by a business manager who I had kept me waiting hours. I ended up driving off without the equipment and quitting my job. \n\nOn several other occasions I witnessed Texan co-workers abusing homeless people, screaming in their faces, and being general pieces of crap. \n\nThe level of delusional BS down there is absolutely off the charts. I constantly get calls to go down and do contract work, but absolutely refuse every single offer. I have absolutely no interest in ever stepping foot in that state ever again. \n\nEdit: In response to questions, I have a few more.\n\nA co-worker from our Dallas location thought he struck another vehicle and so he pulled over. Someone rear ended him and died. They charged him with vehicular homicide and put him on trial. The day of the verdict he didn't show up, but was judged not guilty anyways. Turns out he didn't show up because he committed suicide because he couldn't face the pressure.\n\nA few months later there was some autistic kid down the street who wanted to wear navy blue pants to school, but his mother thinks only black pants are allowed. The autistic kid was actually right, but not before the police showed up and beat the shit out of the kid....over a pair of pants. \n\nIn another incident some kid was pooping in weird places at a rural school, so the school locked down and searched the kids buttcracks for evidence. \n\nThe more I think about this stuff the crazier it sounds. It's just so completely irrational in every way. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "body": ">Is there not a standard operating procedure for police to use in these fucking cases?\n\nYes. There are. I worked in law enforcement for a brief period and was a bit of a freak about learning how cops worked in detail, but I'll bet good money that you've seen The proper procedure a few times in your life before. \n\nIt's called a \"Felony Stop\" when a cop is pulling someone over on a traffic violation and gets notified that the car is stolen, suspected in a robbery, connected to someone suspected of murder, etc. Basically, any suspected felony that is connected to the car or people in it. Thus, any time you've seen the conclusion of a police chase, you're watching a felony stop. \n\nNow, as for the procedures of a felony stop, cops are trained to do them *rigorously* when they're first going through the academy and going through their initial training phase within the department they're hired on for. It is something you would expect a cop's FTO (Field Training Officer; the cop that is assigned to train a rookie when they're new to a department) to practice with the rookie cop a couple dozen times or more before he signs off on the completion of that officer's Field Training. All departments in the US are separate entities that follow state guidelines and their own internal procedures for how often different types of training are conducted, but I would expect any PD with more than 50 cops in it is going to have regular training on these sort of instances where force is needed-- partly to promote officer safety, and mostly so that the department is able to defend themselves in lawsuits that will arise. If the department can point to regular training, the department can say, \"these are the procedures, we train our cops and retrain them every six months, and this officer followed his training just like we taught. In court, this is all done to show that they did try to keep their cops knowledgeable to prevent situations like this. Sometimes, they'll use the training to say that an officer acted outside department policy, something such as \"the department tried to train him and repeatedly did have this officer complete retraining every six months after that, so please don't award quite so much money.\"\n\nAnyway, a modified version of a felony traffic stop would've been perfect in this situation. Plus, all the cops are trained in it, so everyone will know exactly what the steps are. You have the subject face away from the police. Maybe have him grab the collar of his shirt and pull upwards from the collar to demonstrate he doesn't have any weapons in the waistband. THE VERY FIRST STEP IN THIS METHOD WOULD'VE PREVENTED THE EXACT PRETENSE THAT WAS USED TO SHOOT THIS MAN FROM OCCURRING! They would've never seen his hand brushing the side of his shorts to be an aggressive move if they had taken this one step. Anyway, you have the guy face away from you, interlace his fingers on top of his head, lower himself to his knees, and cross his legs behind himself. You then have one officer cover while another officer comes up from the rear and places handcuffs on the suspect. This is so simple, and it's been standard practice in police departments since the late 90s. The idea that these guys were trained to handle this situation in this way is absolutely insane and nearly impossible for me to believe. \n\nI really think that this was an execution. And I don't understand what else explains all the shitty ways that weren't within any department's procedures for how to take a compliant person that might be armed into custody. Had this guy been non-compliant, this would be another story. But a felony traffic stop is something that happens a few times every month in any department, and is definitely something cops see or conduct at least every month or two-- at the most. Any other way to go about doing it, such as whatever this bullshit was, increases the chance of a citizen or a cop getting hurt needlessly in the process. Thus, even police departments that don't give a shit about hurting the people they interact with will implement these best practices to cut down on injuries and subsequent disability claims and all the expenses incurred there. This whole thing is horse shit. \n\nI have no idea how their defense lawyer got him off, but it reminds me of a story my attorney told me when I was considering going to trial instead of pleading guilty to a DWI I was charged with: Basically, a past client of my attorney had insisted on taking a case he had been charged with to trial because he was innocent, the state head shitty evidence, and he didn't want to plead to a crime he didn't commit-- even though the prosecution had ordered him a pretty sweet deal (details escape me now, but this guy was certainly not-guilty in the eyes of my/his attorney). After giving this guy all the warnings in the world of taking any case, even the best case, to trial, he insisted on it still. So the lawyers argue their case, do their thing, and the jury comes back a few hours later with a guilty verdict-- on all counts. My/his attorney knew that this was a possibility, but truly couldn't believe he would be found guilty on all counts. Once everything had wrapped up, the attorney talked to the jury Foreman and found out that 5 of the 6 jurors (or whatever the number was; all but one) had initially voted not-guilty. The one guilty verdict on the room was gung-ho about voting guilty. That juror told the other jurors that he knows a lot of cops and that they DON'T lot. Ever. About anything. He went on for the next couple hours arguing his point until all but one juror had now switched to a guilty verdict. The other 5 jurors were now begging the foreman to switch to guilty so they could get out in time for lunch. And so he did. Here's the kicker: after that story about the jury deliberations came out, the attorney comes to find out that the man on the jury was a volunteer fire fighter who had lied or been untruthful/deceitful when asked during selection if he was employed in any capacity with the city government. He said no because he had a full time job doing something else, and was a volunteer firefighter. But he still received a small paycheck each month for the city. It also turned out that he looked when they asked if he knew any police officers and one or two other questions during jury selection as well. Anyway, the attorney then went on to explain that none of this shit mattered one bit. The fact that a juror lied during selection is not a basis for an appeal/retrial/etc. The fact that that one juror changed the entire jury to another plea doesn't matter. None of that had anything to do with the \"facts amd evidence of the case\" according to the law. So yeah, maybe that's what happened with this jury. They deliberated for a long time and a good explanation for that would be a rogue juror or two that swung every other juror over to a not-guilty verdict after a couple days of fighting. Whatever might've happened, we know that it wasn't a slam-dunk not-guilty like so many other officer involved shootings. ",

I keep trying to play the other side, to see what the cops were seeing and see how they reacted, but it still doesn't make sense.  \n\nThe shooter and the officer giving commands were not the same person, the person getting the commands was obviously not the same person.  \n\nSo we have three people.  \n\nThe shooter, who I read was given the singular task of looking for threatening movement and subduing the threat.  \n\nThe one giving orders, who's job it is to control the situation and try and get the suspects to comply, end goal should obviously be reducing the threat to everyone to zero, so they can interview and search without worry.\n\nAnd the suspect, who to the police is an X factor, but until the commands started getting confusing, had been totally compliant.  \n\nThere is obviously a potential for someone hiding or something else, but if that's the case, then they didn't really remove that threat possibility by shooting the guy who's laying down.  \n\nI digress. \n\nWhy wasn't the shooter, once the suspects were on their stomachs, told to swap to a taser?  His job should have been to keep the taser trained on the prone suspects in case one went for a weapon, or to run, or to just attack a cop.  No reason to still be armed with an AR15 against a man on his tummy with his face in the carpet.  Another cop should have had an AR15 aimed at the hotel room door in case of some potential sneak attack, shout in that this is your last chance to come out like your friends did and if you don't you'll be treated as hostile.  No one else was insane, so that should have ended there with a cop trained on an empty hotel room door.  \n\nThe shooter is then trained with a taser on the two on the floor.  Tell the male to cross his legs, interlock his fingers.  I think what they need with these commands is a \"GO\" phrase, tell them, \"I'm going to give you a command, don't do anything until I say, 'GO'.  I'll say, \"Lay down on your chest, GO\" and you do that after I say GO.  \n\nThen the suspect knows what is expected and can react accordingly.  Then tell him to stand up but keep his hands in sight at all times, do not place your hands behind your back, no sudden movements, GO. And he can stand up, have him turn around with his hands in the air and walk backwards, GO.  And he does that, so then an officer can meet him, grab his hands, and put cuffs on.  Subdued.  Now they can search and clear the hotel room.  \n\nWhat's insane is that the officer shouting commands escalated and made the commands impossible, the shooter was then tasked with the split second decision of whether each jerky move by a terrified suspect was a threat or not.  \n\nIt's all about escalation and poor planning by the police.  All their training is what to do if you have a hostile target, but if your training is for what to do when someone pulls a gun, then what do you do when they don't?  I'm just ranting but this problem is bigger than some asshole who didn't know if he was pulling a gun or pulling up his pants or getting a command wrong.  It's systemic.  Trickling down through the system is lousy training, focus on armed response, escalation, etc.  \n\nI'm so mad because I could see myself being the guy getting shot.  Doing nothing wrong but being too anxious and scared and getting killed for it.  ",
