Sites that can't afford to pay ISPs for users to have faster access and sites that will have access prices put on them will be making less money.

Only reason why I am starting to think I may make a change now is because I have some apps (like TeamSnap) that no longer run on my older OS.\n\nBums me out too, because the Note 2 seems [to me] to be the swansong of Samsung's line.

I had a 4s that ran like a champ for 4 years, where i intentionally never updated to the iPhone6 iOS build because i'd heard it was bricking the older phones. One day, an app i used fairly regularly wouldn't open anymore. I tried to update the app, it said i needed the latest iOS version first. Updated the OS, app update allowed the app to work again but the phone was essentially useless at that point. Would take 5-10 seconds after tapping an app before it would try to load, 2-3 second lag behind keystrokes just trying to send texts...\n\nBattery going from 3 days of light use per charge to 2 days or even 1 day after a few years is to be expected. Total breakdown of the phone's usability is a completely different issue, and blaming it on diminished battery life is a cop out. ","332":"I have an iPad 1.  They cut off software upgrades to it years and years ago, long before this started becoming a problem for people.\n\nYou know what's interesting?  Its battery life is *great*.\n\nThe only issues I have with it are intermittent browser crashes due to websites not being optimized for devices from the stone age.","333":"It is funny.. got my wife an ipad air 2 about 18 months ago.. it was fast.

Her ipad air 2 with the latest OS is getting slower and slower.. same with her iphone 6... the batteries are lasting plenty long where she would so much rather it run better than be slow.  I keep telling her if she wants the iPhone 8 or X she can have it, but she WILL have this same issue again.

It still performs well enough for my needs and the display quality still competes with the newer devices out there. AND it has a replaceable battery, an SD card slot and a headphone jack. The OEM battery is starting to lose run time now but considering how old it is, that's hardly surprising. I think manufacturers have really jumped the shark on some of these things. I don't need the phone 3 mm thinner, I need serviceability. ","355":"This is the reason I'm sticking to the LG G5 until it fully quits.

But this a lose lose situation and people always bring this up. The problem is every phone has a different feature set. So you're always \"encouraging\" a manufacturer to leave something out. No phone has 100% of all the features out there. So for instance, I wanted a phone with a head phone jack. I bought the S8. I'd also love to have stock android. People will tell me \"if you wanted your S8 to behave like stock android, you should have bought a Pixel\" If I would have bought a Pixel... you guessed it I would have been encouraging manufacturers to take out the head phone jack. Now I'm left encouraging manufacturers to be slow with their updates...","357":"Here's the thing. Almost no new phones let you replace the battery anymore.

I'm not sure if it's based on the battery's capacity or on the drop in voltage. My battery had 50% of its original capacity, and the CPU was at 65% of its original speed. \n\nDownload an app called CPU Dasher X (EDIT: actually try Geekbench 4 instead, costs the same but more features) and it will tell you your CPU speed, then you can look up what it's supposed to be on google (if iphone 6+ it's 1400MHz). You can also download Battery Life Doctor and it will tell you what your battery capacity is compared to the original.\n\nYou can get your battery replaced at Apple or at a 3rd party place like Batteries + Bulbs (I think price is $60-80). You can also get a battery + tools for like $25 on Amazon, but it is annoying to replace since the battery is glued in with adhesive.","361":"I learned the hard way to never update my iOS.

Switched to android and have been kicking myself for putting up with apple for so long with that phone.\n\n\nEdit: I booted the phone up to check on it and it still does most of that without its sim card. It's still synced to my accounts so it immediately alerted me to upcoming appointments. I also forgot I left music I paid for on this thing!

Most of the victims were companies that were still using Windows XP in 2017, long after Microsoft officially announced they no longer supported it, let alone after Windows 7 came out. ","372":"In that case, find a phone that has the LEAST amount of stuff you hate. For example, I frequently use headphone jacks - can't go without them, so the lack of a headphone jack meant I could scratch the Pixel 2, iPhone 7,8,X, and a few others off my list immediately.

Still rocking it with latest Android and wicked battery life!","377":"I had to resort to rebuilding mine by hand as no one makes them anymore. It wasn't that bad. Just a bunch of 18650 cells soldered together. Those can be found new still. If you're a diy kinda guy it's the way to go. ","378":"Won't be long though. Your GPS will be first to go. Then maybe the volume up button. The screen will start to have backlight bleed patches and image persistence. I too loved my LG G5 while it worked.","379":"Fuck yes! Plus the LG G5 is awesome! I love messing with the wide angle camera features. I have a spare battery to use as a backup when the main one dies and swapping out broken parts is damn easy to do on it.","380":"I can't update my 5s because I tried once and it bricked my phone.  Took me about a day to figure out how to wipe it and start over as a new phone, so I did. The backup didn't work though, so I lost some stuff. It works okay now, just a bit slow in app launching sometimes, and in unlocking.\n\nFunny, I can sit there and try to unlock my phone with my thumb like 12 or 15 times and it won't even register that I touched it, like no 'Try again' or anything, it's like I lost my thumb print entirely. Usually have to end up typing in my code, not really a big deal. HOWEVER, my banking app has *never* had a problem logging in, and I use the same thumbprints to do that. It works 100% of the time immediately, but noooooo, the phone itself has troubles unlocking.\n\nFuck you, Apple, when I need to upgrade, I'm getting a Samsung.","381":"Those books were inspired by what Huxley or Orwell saw hints of in the real world.

There have been a number of critical patches for Windows 10 machines in recent months that you really, really need to apply.\n\nSomehow getting people to trust and apply updates as soon as possible needs to be top priority now. Updates that break things or frustrate people by interrupting them is harmful if it means they just flat out stop updating. That's how you get vulnerabilities which have had patches available for months knocking out entire companies and healthcare systems. People (including sysadmins) stop trusting and applying patches and then systems die.\n\nFor Apple, shit like this article needs to be cut out. For Microsoft that means... I don't even know. More QA?

Proponents of net neutrality provided numerous examples of specific anti-consumer practices that ISPs could undertake without net neutrality like throttling traffic to competing streaming services, blocking content outright, charging companies money for fast lanes, etc.\n\nIf the instant net neutrality was repealed, ISPs did the exact opposite of what they promised, and did exactly what proponents of net neutrality warned against, then of course their legal argument falls flat on its face.\n\nSo no, in the short term, nothing is likely to change.

This has been translated into political and economic life, so it can be read a little more like this: The powerful will take care of the weak, so the weak should also take care of the powerful.\n\n>CEOs take care of their employees, and in response, employees give their best.\n\n>It's an abuse-able agreement for certain, as has been seen throughout history, but generally speaking this is credited as being one of the reasons that the pay and wealth disparity is much lower in Japan than the US.\n\nEDIT: A few people have said this, but before idolizing confucianism we do have to acknowledge that when I say \"It's an abuse-able agreement\" I really mean \"It is an agreement actively being abused.\" Powerful people can and do frequently abuse this understanding. It has contributed to a host of issues, not the least of which is the infamous workaholic work culture of Japan. This is a real problem, not to be discounted, dismissed, nor made light of.\n\nEDIT2: Additionally, I did not mean to imply that this was the sole reason for lower wealth gaps. There are many others. But this is an underlying principle to Japanese culture that does curb some of the excesses of capitalistic ventures. The bankers in the US would have been social pariahs, as would their children and grandchildren.

When I worked in a restaurant through high school and college I was always abused by the smokers.

I would then have to pick up the slack.  Some were worse than others.  Then of course they would come back smelling absolutely awful.  As a customer I hate being served by a smoker who recently smoked.  My state outlawed smoking in restaurants years ago, one of the best things they ever did.  \n\nIn the professional world now I will see people go out to smoke an hour before the end of the day.  But in reality it kills the last 90 minutes of productivity.  \"Oh, it is almost smoke time, better stop what I am doing and just goof off for a bit.\"  Then of course the 10 minute break is closer to 30.  So they get back with 30 minutes to go \"Oh man, only 30 minutes left, might as well not start on anything else since it will just get interrupted with quitting time\".  Might as well have just sent these people home 90 minutes early.  Same would happen leading up to lunch.  They blow 3 hours of productivity because of two 10 minute smoke breaks.

This isn't true for most people, most people would happily take a lower risk for smoking fewer cigarettes and the contention that it is just as bad to be a light smoker compared to a heavy smoker might dissuade people from cutting down.\n\nWith that said let's turn to the literature:\n[this recent review](https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC2865193\/) Looks at the risk of various smoking-related diseases in light smokers*. Two main effects stand out: cardiovascular disease and lung cancer.\n\n\nWith lung cancer being a light smoker does put you at greater risk than a non-smoker (3-5 times greater risk), but that increase in risk pales in comparison to being a heavy smoker (13-23 times greater risk).\n\n\nWith cardiovascular disease we see that light smoking gives you 70% of the increase in risk that heavy smoking does, so in this case it seems that even low consumption of cigarettes results in a similar risk to high consumption (which is what the webmd link is implying).\n\nOne thing not considered in any of this data is the risk of becoming a heavy smoker that comes with light smoking.\n\nTL\/DR: With cardiovascular disease it seems that it even social smoking can increase your risk by a similar amount to heavy smoking. With lung disease however, there is very much a dose-dependent effect, less smoking results in a significantly lower risk for lung cancer. \n\n\n*the paper notes that the definition of \"Light smoker\" ranges from anywhere to 5-20 cigarettes a day, so it is difficult to determine whether the effects seen here are the same for this rather large range in consumption.\n","609":"probably not going to get lung cancer from the \"a smoke\" at shows and parties.\n\nBut I'm also probably not a doctor.\n\nProbably.

In a deflationary economy, you earn money in real terms just by storing cash under your mattress - there is no point buying things or investing unless you have to because everything will be cheaper next year. This is a death sentence for an economy that wants to grow and advance.  \n\nThe reason for why this is bad is pretty complicated, but among other effects you will see the increase of government and personal debt in real terms and a shrinking of the size of the economy. A worst case scenario would be a deflationary spiral, where financial institutions start to collapse due to all the bad debt that has to be written off.","623":"Inflation is good. Hyperinflation is bad for obvious reasons. Negative inflation is also bad because it disincentivizes economic activity.\n\nAn analogy would be to think of a game where you're being chased, and forward movement to the goal is economic growth.

Perhaps it would be fair to say that Confucianism furthered already existing tendencies?\n\nIt could be, and I'm outside any sort of expertise that I have, so do not take this as authoritative, but it could be that the Japanese already had this sort of customary practice, but Confucianism gave it a more structured format.\n\nFull disclosure, I believe that Confucius was the single greatest moral philosopher ever to live. He lived 100-200 years before Plato, and 2-300 years before Aristotle, yet the combined summation of their virtue ethics amounts to a really impractical version of Confucianism. So I will probably tend to over-emphasize the influence he had. But I really do think that the Japanese used a Confucian template to slowly restructure their social order, and I would argue that they knowingly did so.\n\nI should make clear that Japan modified Confucianism significantly to fit their political structure and culture.

There wouldn't have been a need to lie. ","661":"As someone who has been both salary and hourly in the same workplace, it really doesn't matter. People still romanticize salary jobs with crap like \"you can leave early if you get your work done,\" which is simply not true. There might be employers with a policy like that but it's not a product of being salaried.\n\nPlenty of hourly employees slack off and spend half their day redditing and plenty of salaried employees work hard for 8 hours\/day with little to no breaks.

Highschool made it all worse and I didn't have anyone to really...fall back on. I came from a poor family, my mom was a drug addict, my dad fell back into alcoholism when my nanny (his mother) died.

I was really struggling and I had a few acquiescence I had made with some goth and punk kids. \n\n\nWell, one day, one of them I'd say I was friends with came to me and gave me this beat up discman.

My local radio station had a meet-&-greet at a Blockbuster Music and barely anyone had heard of them. The rock station in town was **not** liked at all, in fact shut down in 2002 for being \"too vulgar\" playing heavy metal music, and not many people listened to it at all. \n\nAnyway, all of 10 people showed up to the meet-&-greet at the record store. I remember seeing a young guy with green hair come out of an SUV and we didn't even know what Linkin Park looked like really. No one clapped, no one really noticed until they went in and sat down. They had their CD, Hybrid Theory up for sale for $4.99 and they would sign it for free. Didn't want to buy it, but the radio station gave me a license plate for them to sign.\n\nI got to talk to Chester at the event a little bit, and he seemed like a really nice guy and was SUPER excited to have even 10 people show up for him. He shook all of our hands and him and Mike Shinoda were really gracious guys - the whole band was really. They were still SUPER new and being on a nationwide tour with P.O.D. was just a lot for them to process. I'll never forget meeting them, I still remember it fondly 16 years later. I've always been a fan, I even bought their songs for Rock Band 3 and bought the keyboard that goes with so I could play the Pro Keys for it, which was somewhat like actually playing the song. \n\nTo my wife, she was going through stage 4 breast cancer in 2001 (we didn't know each other at the time) and she was given 3 months to live. She struggled though, but she thought it was the end for her. The music of Linkin Park's first album, especially \"In The End\" was what got her through her Chemo and radiation therapy and she's now 16 years cancer-free. She is beyond words right now, I wish I wasn't stuck at work right now.\n\nRIP Chester.","676":"I'm Asian, so I never talk about my feelings because it's a bad holdover from how I was raised.\n\nWhen I was younger, I was walled in by strict christian Asian parents who dictated my life. I was only to have christian friends. I was to win at everything. A loss, to them, was only possible if I did not have faith in god and was therefore a wicked child who didn't try hard enough. If god could part the red sea, surely I could become the national champion in six different things at once. I became the state chess, debate and science fair champion, made it to all state in violin, and one tier below the professional orchestra at NEC. They didn't even go to my state debate champion awards ceremony. I remember standing alone outside waiting to be picked up while the second and even fifth place winners walked out with their happy parents. I cried, and when my father took me home he beat me for crying. I got straight As, I got a perfect score on the PSAT and a 2360 on the SAT. I took every single AP class at once and even took all of Harvard's undergraduate curriculum for biology while still in high school. It didn't matter. Nothing was ever good enough for them. Success wasn't to be rewarded. It was expected. The only time my father ever told me he was proud of me was when I got into caltech, which was immediately followed by his profound disappointment that I did not get into Harvard. I was only allowed to listen to classical music and was not allowed to hang out with other kids except christian kids and only on special occasions during christian potlucks. We only wore khaki pants and polo shirts, with the pants pulled up very high so we didn't look like \"gangsters with saggy jeans\". Dating was forbidden, and any sexual confusion was just ignored and treated like a mysterious evil curse. \n\nBecause my grandfather was both a pastor and military policeman with old ROC values, my father was just as strict and frugal. We had descended from the \"Dragon\" family line of generals stretching far back into history. We were to assemble at attention in a line instantly when called within 10 seconds or be beaten. No heat on the coldest nights and no air conditioning on the hottest days. Showers should only take 1 minute. We were not allowed to have food preferences. All food had been graciously provided by god, they said. He would buy clothes too big for us meant to last ten years. No TV. No celebrations on sinful american holidays. We were to forgo earthly needs, because \"man did not live on bread alone.\" Often, dinner consisted of a $1 hot dog wrapped in a kraft cheese single with one piece of white bread and a slice of lettuce. We ate rice gruel often. To this day I have a preference for super cheap food, like eating plain rice with just soy sauce and sesame oil. Because he didn't believe in women's rights or birth control, my mother kept having children. I had 4 other siblings. This made us very poor. Sometimes all we had to eat were saltines and condiments that we took from the free section of wendy's. We lived in a barn infested with bugs and were the poorest kids in town. I remember one time I asked my mother if we could give a friend a ride two blocks down and she screamed at me and then broke down in tears, saying we were running out of gas for the month and that my dad had to get to work. When things finally did get better, my dad said he would buy us an xbox if we could beat him in chess. When we beat him, he said instead that we had to win a tournament. When we finally got the console, he made us play The Bible Game on it, banned most violent games, and play DDR to exercise but only on songs that he approved of.\n\nBecause god had let the Israelites wander for 40 years as punishment until every person older than 18 died, my parents took that to mean that children weren't considered humans yet who could really make judgements they could be held accountable for. They basically thought we had no human rights of our own. My family made Tiger Mom look like Barney.\n\nBecause I had almost died when I was two months old to pneumonia, my parents had declared me a sacrifice to god, a Nazirite, if I were to survive. \"You are a priest forever, in the name of Melchizedek\", they told me. My life was not my own, because I had already died and this new life belonged to god. They named me Long Zhan in Chinese, meaning Dragon Warrior, and Genesis in english. I was to wear the armor of god and wage holy war against Satan. Ironically it basically meant my names were Genesis and Revelation, since revelation is often known as the dragon war. Which meant they named me Alpha and Omega, or god.\n\nOne day I stumbled upon a book in my father's study, where he kept his books from college. I read Nietzche's Beyond Good And Evil, thinking it was a christian book. When I finished reading it, everything changed. The things he said made too much sense for me to ignore.\n\nTHERE IS NO GOD kept flashing in my mind. I couldn't ignore it. I tried to force myself to believe in god and become christian again but it didn't work. I tried praying, but god wasn't there.\n\nI hid my new beliefs. I knew what would happen if my parents, who often told me that a wicked child should be stoned to death, found out. They often said they would rather kill me with their bare hands than raise an atheist.\n\nIt came to a head one day in middle school when I couldn't deal with a meaningless life anymore. I snuck away during worship and hid under a staircase, repeating to myself in shock \"what's the point?\"\n\nMy friend Katherine found me there. She understood. She was also dealing with hidden depression. We sat in our misery for hours. Before that moment, it seemed everyone was in paradise. That they were the dancing figures on the walls in Plato's cave that I was once a part of. It seemed all of them faced forward and that somehow I had looked backwards and found the void of nothingness behind their paradise that nobody else saw. But when I asked her what we could do, she didn't know how to answer either. We were blind leading the blind.\n\nToday I know this feeling isn't rare and that I wasn't alone. But because I was so isolated by christian rules, I didn't know of anything else in the world. I didn't know that the somber \"why bother\" of nihilism could be interpreted as the adventurous \"why not?\" I was an echo chamber of my own dark thoughts, with no-one to guide me. The only wise people were philosophers I read after Nietzche like Kant, and they were all dead. They couldn't talk to me. It was a long time before I would ever discover Nagel and Camus or the freedom of absurdism. Everyone I knew was christian. We had spent years shunning non-christians and the world outside my bubble was classified under a ubiquitous fog of war.\n\nWhen my father found me under the stairs he yelled at me for embarrassing him in the church and beat me when I got home. Slowly, they began to suspect that I was no longer christian. I remember making armor out of cardboard and wood in secret to protect against my father's blows. I remember making a runaway kit.  I remember running for my life up into the attic to keep my mother from killing me with a kitchen knife and calling the police while holding the door shut with my feet as she clawed at it. I remember fighting my father with a chair and cooking pot when he came for me with a metal bat.\n\nA friend of mine sent me the song Numb. I know that song saved me. It finally told me that someone else out there had dealt with this and come out with this beautiful song. It told me that the veneer of constant serenity of christianity I had forgotten I had even put up was a farce, that sometimes it was okay to be upset and mad and to punch a wall and let out all of these feelings instead of letting them eat me up. That it was preferable to feel anything, even bad things, instead of nothing, because then I valued the good more. The sonorific screams cut through my numbness.\n\nI remember sneaking up at 5am at night to play Morrowind to deal with stress while listening to Meteora on my cd player in secret and all the candy bars I had to sell at school to buy new batteries. I remember how when I entered portal temples Easier To Run would somehow always play as the sun rose outside my window, like it was telling me someday I would be free. To this day that song still pops up in my mind unbidden every time the sun rises. I listened to that CD player until it stopped spinning. I remember how I danced to Faint and went wild so I wouldn't be ignored anymore, how I longed for Somewhere I Belong and my heart soared when the ghostly echo of \"heal\" sounded. I remember being inspired to draw gothic art of monsters by Papercut, and how my mother poured oil on it and threw it in the trash. Years later when my sister took art lessons, I snuck something I drew to her teacher. He told me I had more talent than my sister did, said it to my mother's face. And my sister won the congressional national competition and her art is hanging in capitol hill. He made my sister use my other art pieces as the basis for her next few pieces, that I had given to my friend Annette in a folder so that it wouldn't be found in my house.\n\nToday, I'm a scientist and a breakdancer with zero signs of depression. I pushed through despite my parents not supporting my desire to be a biologist because they didn't believe in evolution, or thinking that breakdancing was just something that homeless black gangsters did while rolling around dirty floors. I taught myself bioinformatics in the kitchen, did research by hand that others did on computers or in the lab. I learned to do dangerous moves on concrete. Linkin Park saved my life. I have never cared for celebrity news before but somehow I am genuinely sad at Chester's passing because this man who saved me had no one to save him and I feel almost guilty.","677":"If you are in your late 20s, Linkin Park is part of the soundtrack of your youth.  I hope he knew.","678":"In October 2001 my fiance died from a drug overdose\/suicide. I hurt so bad that it took all I had not to join him. I can remember listening to Hybrid Theory every day while driving to work. Their music made me understand why my fiance had took his life. Their music actually kept me from losing what little mind I had left.. Chester was in so much pain and his music expressed a dark world that I'm so familiar with. I hope my fiance and Chester have found  the peace they desperately had been searching for.. I don't know why I'm sitting here crying. Chester's death is bringing up memories that I had thought time had buried. I was just a young mom back then.. Now my children are grown and I'm a grandma. Just breaks my heart. I know the hell Chester's family and friends are going thru so well. You never forget. You just suck it down until the ghost's  catch up with you in the darkness of the night..","679":"M.

No one had a bigger impact on me growing up with music than Linkin Park. \n\nOne of the best voices out there in rock\/alternative. ","681":"He had dealt with addiction and depression for a long time. So sad to see this happen. \n\nIf anyone has problems please seek help. ","682":"This is...really sad.  This post is kind of a mess because I was trying to find information about this show while I wrote it and I kept going back and adding information.  Sorry about that.\n\nSo, I met these guys right before the release of Hybrid Theory.  They were an opening act...\n\n...I can't think of who the headliner was though...Found it!  Looks like I was there to see Twiztid and Kottonmouth Kings - no wonder I couldn't really remember that part of the show.  I was going though a juggalo phase, think of that what you will.  Oh yeah, ReHab was there and at that time they were this corny rap group who actually had strippers that toured with them.  Same songs, but they sounded completely different.\n\nRight - they were opening that tour (I don't think anyone was there to see them, in fact) at a little club in Winston Salem, NC:  Ziggy's.  It's closed now but they used to have some amazing shows.  I saw acts from Hank Williams III to Deftones to Weezer to ICP there, it was a really kind of \"close\" space - just about anywhere you were, it felt like you could reach out and touch the people on stage.\n\n...or at least get fully doused in Faygo\n\nAnyway, their show - this would have been around mid-to-late 1999 (found it!  Looking through setlist.fm - it was September 18th, 2000) was just amazing, partly because of the venue but largely because of their performance.\n\nThere couldn't have been more than a couple of dozen people in the place for their show, but it was probably one of the tightest live performances I've *ever* seen - and I've helped run sound for acts like MDC, Jucifer, Skeleton Witch, and plenty of others - not to mention the shows I've attended as an audience member.\n\nThe guitar player wore headphones.  I've never seen anyone else do that.  The \"DJ\" didn't just do the record-scratching that it seemed all other rap-rock-metal-alternative-Bizkit-bands did around then.  He was live-sampling and mixing the levels of the other members on stage.  The synergy between them was on another level.  The live sound was pretty much album-quality, but it was right *there*...\n\nI told them as much after the show.  They were humble, gracious, and extremely nice.  I told them straight up:  You guys are going to be selling out arenas before too much longer.  I'm paraphrasing here, but Chester said something like \"that would be amazing, but I don't really think so.  We've been doing this kind of thing for a while now and we just love going around and playing for people who are into the music.\"  It seemed like they weren't thinking \"what does the radio want, how can we sell a hundred million records?\" - they were more like \"this is what we sound like when we do what we love, enjoy it with us.\n\nChester and Mike signed two demo tapes for me.  I've still got them.  Besides tshirts, posters, and other random merch that I've been given by bands who I've booked or done stage work for, I don't really have any other \"memorabilia\" - just those two tapes.  I stopped paying attention to them well over a decade ago.  I just wasn't into the sound anymore, to be honest - tastes change.  I still think the first record is brilliant, and the second record is pretty great too - those songs will always remind me of my early years in the Marines.  Someone was almost always blasting one of those CDs during field day.\n\nI mopped so many floors to those tracks.\n\nI wish he hadn't gone so soon.  He was full of music, and poetry.  Maybe it was a bit on-the-nose, a bit too much angst...too much anger, resentment, and other vague but passionate feelings towards an undefined \"you.\"  Some might say that's simplistic, formulaic - but it allows for the listener to place themselves in the narrative of the song, and recognize the things that they're feeling - and know by extension that they're not alone.  As an angsty young guy with too many hormones and too little life experience, it was very therapeutic sometimes to just turn the volume up and scream along.  I know I'm not alone in this either - I've seen you doing the same thing when I drive by you in traffic, don't try to deny it.\n\nIt's just a shame that the man who wrote those words couldn't find the same solace in them that they conveyed to so many others.\n\nI could close this out with almost any couple of lines from one of their songs, but I don't want to pick just one.  So go hit up YouTube, dig deep into your mp3 library, or even dust off an old CD and play a song or two for yourself...and enjoy the music.  That's what he told me was most important, and I think that's the kind of farewell he would have wanted.","683":"What's sad is Chester was lashing out at fans a couple months ago, because fans hated their new album for being over produced pop. He was angry at being called a sell out and was confrontational. He seemed genuinely angry and was lashing out constantly. A redditor below said that in recent shows, fans would throw bottles at them when they played their new singles.\n\nThen his best friend Chris Cornell dies, and it's his birthday today. I wonder if it was all too much for him. Since he took his life the same way Chris did, and on his birthday.\n\nAs someone that did not like their new album, I feel fuckin awful. I know I wasn't an asshole about it, and I have a right to be critical. But as someone that grew up with their music (Hybrid theory and Meteora were huge in middle school) - I can't help but feel awful.\n\n**EDIT:**\n\nI apologize if I opened up a debate about criticism. This is a touchy subject given Chester just died. But to be clear, I'm only talking about myself on a personal level in my post.\n\nI didn't mean to make others feel guilty for not liking an album. It's perfectly okay to not like art and to even be critical of it. I think we all know the difference between being critical - and being an asshole. Attacking him and yelling he's a sell out on twitter - because he made music you didn't like - that is not valid criticism. That is malicious. That isn't the same as not liking an album, and being critical.\n\nI'm sorry if I pushed this conversation into another direction. I've been crying non stop, and I can't help but feel a lot of emotions. I personally feel guilt - but it's not rational. It's just a personal thing I'm feeling. I didn't mean for others to feel that.\n\nI also wanted to say that, we fans (regardless if you hated some of their work) - should be supporting each other and not taking out our emotions on each other. At the end of the day, we all loved a piece of who they are. We all loved what Chester could create. It doesn't matter if we all don't love the same things.\n\n*hugs*\n\nI love you guys \n\nI'm sorry.\n\n\n\n","684":"Time is a valuable thing\n\nWatch it fly by as the pendulum swings\n\nWatch it count down to the end of the day\n\nThe clock ticks life away\n\nIt's so unreal","685":"I didn't know the death of a singer could hit me so hard, I grew up listening to linkin park..man","686":"I've struggled with depression since I was not even a teenager. When I was 13, Hybrid Theory came out, and it was the first album I ever bought with my own money. I was living in podunk East Texas, didn't fit in, and had caught one of their songs on the satellite music channel...I played that album constantly - until Reanimation came out, and I played that instead. Within a couple of years, I had mostly moved away from that sound, but I've never lost an appreciation for LP. They play music that's easy to identify with and I love that they didn't stick to their original sound. I always felt a gratitude to them (Chester and Mike), for saying the things I felt.

Music has always played a huge role in my life, but never more than when I was first in recovery. I listened to Linkin Park SO MUCH early on, because both the words and Chester's expression of them totally represented all the anger, confusion, conflict, hopelessness AND hope that I felt. Faint, Numb, Somewhere I Belong, Breaking the Habit, Crawling, Runaway...Oh, man. Knowing that he had his own battle with addiction is one of the things that made him so authentic.

I remember feeling so connected with Crawling, One Step Closer etc. For two straight years I listened to only Linkin Park. Yes it was kiddish, but it helped me through so much. I cant believe that I am crying. \n\nLP got me into music. The guitar I use is a PRS, because Brad used it. \n\nWhat really made LP different? I am going to say Chester. He poured his heart into singing. The guy has been thorough so much. Every single lyric he sang had some sort of angst, and he conveyed it so well.\n\nHas anyone heard of 'Breaking the Habit\"? Chester couldnt sing that song for a year after it was released because it was so personal. \n\nHe was my Idol.

They were playing a commercial for it on TV with clips of One Step Closer's music video. It was one of the first times I was really introduced to nu-metal that I liked and I remember being so excited about the album coming out. I bought it day one and listened to it over and over again. That blossomed into my adoration of all different genres of metal, which got me into playing musical instruments. Playing music gave me a greater respect for the talent that goes into ALL genres of music and really broadened my horizon for what I listen to. I don't know if that would have all happened without Linkin Park. Yet another sad day for music.

I gotta write this.\n\nHybrid Theory on CD was mine the week it came out, and Linkin Park immediately became a foundational pillar of my musical world. I was 13 at the time. Over the years, I have never lost faith in them or hated them. The only album I haven't loved is The Hunting Party. I adore every other main album of theirs for various reasons.\n\nI fucking LOVE One More Light. The band was never, ever afraid of exploring and trying new sounds. Sell outs? Nah, they morphed their music as they grew as people, and appropriately so.\n\nQuick story: my father was arrested for some real shit when I was in high school, and my family's perfect little suburban Americana life was irrevocably upended. This was soon after Meteora came out, and in my deep depression of immediate post-father-arrest, I became severely attached to the song Breaking the Habit. I would play it on repeat for days and days on my speakers, with my bedroom's door shut and locked (the key to open it always available on the door frame, of course - house rules). My poor mother was worried sick about my intentions, obviously. Back then, I wasn't even considering harming myself, but in retrospect it's completely understandable why she thought so, especially with that song. But goddamnit it helped me cope, and that song is the single most important song in my entire life, and a complete demonstration of how music can heal.\n\nWriting this post has reduced me to tears, and they aren't manly tears, they are pure tears of sadness and pain.

I preferred to wear goth clothing and Linkin Park's 'Hybrid Theory' and 'Meteora' got me through all the finger pointing and ridicule. I got the news of Chester's death while I was at work and immediately broke down and I left, couldn't finish out my shift. If it wasn't for their music, I have no idea how I would have had the strength to power through all the negativity I endured for being a \"Black Rocker\". Thank you Linkin Park. Chester - you are deeply loved, missed, and appreciated. \n\n-Misfit Black Girl ","703":"A little late to this, but it's imperative to remember that while Chester Bennington's suicide is tragic, he was also a survivor of repeated sexual abuse as a child from ages 7-13. He bravely battled depression, body dysmorphia, shame, substance abuse and suicidal thoughts for nearly 30 years; and chose to channel that trauma and anger into his art - something I could certainly relate to (and admire) in my early adolescence. It was rare for \"Hybrid Theory\" to leave my CD player when I was 14\/15. I felt less alone when I listened to that album. I felt understood. I skated to it. Linkin Park - along with Blink 182, NIN, and Marilyn Manson were much more the sound\/a phase of my youth than Sound Garden, or Nirvana.\n\nWhen I look at Chester's life, the life of a tormented artist - who's effort was often ridiculed by people (including myself in my mid-twenties) who don't make anything other than critiques and criticisms - similar to Van Gogh, and David Foster Wallace (who also took their own lives) I am reminded of when I attempted to hang myself, in treatment, when I was nearly 26 years old - and ripped the lighting fixture out of the ceiling. I am reminded of the letter I had written my mother that stated \"I swear to God I tried\", congruent with Van Gogh's last letter to his brother, Theo - in which he wrote \"The sadness will last forever\".\n\nI think about how absolutely (for lack of a better word) *fucked* my life felt after overdosing, getting kicked out of grad school, and finding myself over 40k in debt. Stripped of the only coping mechanism (oxycontin) I had that worked at staving off the torment of just trying to survive. But when I thought I hit bottom, it started hitting back - and I know, from experience (I've broken a lot of bones), that there is no bruise like the bruise that loneliness kicks into your spine. Shame has an uncanny ability to warp\/destroy any healthy perspective of ourselves, and our ability to be loved. It's like a shattered mirror. I thought that there was something inherently wrong with me - that I was broken\/damaged - and that perspective dictated my behavior.\n\nA common misconception about \"why\" people chose to take their own lives is that they are \"weak\" or \"troubled\". And that couldn't be further from the truth.\n\nTo quote David Foster Wallace on the subject:\n\n> The so-called \"psychotically depressed\" person who tries to kill his\/herself doesn't do so out of quote \"hopelessness\" or any abstract conviction that life's assets and debits do not square. And surely not because death seems suddenly appealing. The person in whom Its invisible agony reaches a certain unendurable level will kill themselves the same way a trapped person will eventually jump from the window of a burning high-rise.\n\n> Make no mistake about people who leap from burning windows. Their terror of falling from a great height is still just as great as it would be for you or me standing speculatively at the same window just checking out the view; the fear of falling remains a constant. The variable here is the other terror, the fire's flames: when the flames get close enough, falling to death becomes the slightly less terrible of two terrors. It's not desiring the fall; it's terror of the flames. And yet nobody down on the sidewalk, looking up and yelling \"Don't!\" and \"Hang on!\", can understand the jump. Not really. You'd have to have personally been trapped and felt flames to really understand a terror way beyond falling.\n\n\nHaving felt those flames - and making that choice to jump, I know (now - almost 7 years later) that it was definitively the wrong choice to make. I wasn't aware of any other option. I didn't know that if I asked for help - I wouldn't just learn how to fight those flames - people would meet me in them. I was terrified that if I was honest about how I felt, and what I thought about daily - that I'd end up in drooling in the corner of a padded room - pumped full of so many anti-psychotics that I wouldn't even respond to my own name. But what I was really afraid of was feeling the weight of everything. Of beauty, darkness, and trauma. I couldn't imagine, much less live in a world that wasn't curbed by something.\n\nThese days I'm not plagued, I still have intrusive thoughts, but I promise, it does get better. I got better because I got (and continue to get) the professional help I need(ed). I feel the weight of everything, in it's entirety, and it is more than enough. \n\nI am no longer sick, **I am infected with the tremendous excitement of living, because I believe that I have the strength to bear it. I believe that you do as well.**\n\nSo if you struggle with depression, substance abuse, and\/or suicidal thoughts I want you to know you are not alone. I know that there is hope because I carry it with me. And I'm not going to yell up from the street asking you to hold on. I'll meet you in the flames every time they rise.\n\nAnd I know there is a chance that the worst day may still be coming, so let me say for the record \"I'm still going to be here, asking the world to dance - even if it keeps stepping on my holy feet\".\n\nFriend, if all we have to gain in staying is each other - My God that is plenty. My God, that is enough.\n\nThat is so, so much for the light to give.\n\nPS: Please consider giving a donation to https:\/\/www.rainn.org in Chester's Memory.","704":"As a black man, born and bred in Atlanta Ga. surrounded by \"thugs\" and \"trap stars\" who's on the verge of 30 I have a lot to thank LP and Chester for.\n\nHybrid Theory was the first album I ever bought. It was the first time I truly engaged any music that wasn't rap or RnB. It was the first time I felt the urge to out myself as a \"rocker\" - the first time I ever asserted my identity. Gave me the confidence to consume diverse and disparate music and media. It was the first album that truly spoke to me and connected the dots by giving a voice to my own internal intellectual and emotion conflicts. That album is a part of the foundation of me. Chester was the voice that guided me. My modern blues man.\n\nThis is a massive loss. I only hope that he lived enough to honor whatever was in his heart.","705":"This is going to get buried and that's okay. \n\nI found out at work, and I listened to LP all the way home and wept. A lot of people bash on linkin park, and that's okay. But I grew up on these guys. Their music was a part of my childhood. Looking back now the lyrics were a little vague and the songs may not have been about much but at the time they allowed me to make them about me, about my middle school melodramatic nonsense that seemed so important. \n\nMetaphorically linkin park held my hand, and the hands of millions of other young adolescent kids through some dark and confusing times.

I can only thank the grace of the Almighty that I was never so low that I wanted to hurt myself.\n\nEdit 2 - the reason I mention my faith is that, yes, when I finally got on medication, it helped so much and I'll never downplay how important it is - but getting myself to therapy, and then the three months it took to actually get to a psychiatrist and get prescribed, was a trial.

Thanks to my love of Linkin Park I connected with a girl I met online, who I ended up dating for 3 and a half years and almost marrying. She introduced me to other bands like Coheed and Cambria and AC\/DC, which inspired me to pick up a guitar.  She's long out of my life unfortunately,  but thanks to that guitar I became an amateur musician, which lead me to becoming friends with my 2 best friends who are my life.

Invite him to things often. He will bail on you. He will 400 times. Keep being there for him and giving him opportunities to feel normal again. Maybe on that 401st time, he'll be ready to try to be normal again. I had a friend who did this for me. I asked why she kept inviting me time and time again when I would flake everytime. She said, \"I just wanted you to know that you had options.\" It meant so very much to me. Everyone faded away when my husband dying was old news then someone who I wasn't actually that close to was the one who stayed in contact just to remind me that I had options when I was ready.

Make no mistake about the people who leap from burning windows. Their terror of falling from a great height is still just as great as it would be for you or me standing speculatively at the same window, i.e. the fear of falling remains a constant. The variable here is the other terror, the fire's flames: when the flames get close enough, falling to death becomes the slightly less terrible of two terrors. It's not desiring the fall; it's terror of the flames. And yet nobody down on the sidewalk, looking up and yelling 'Don't!' and 'Hang on!', can understand the jump. Not really.

I have some pretty good ideas as to what kind of dark hell he was in, but by setting it up the way he did, he managed to separate me from any and all fucks I might have given otherwise.  Your suicide can do some very fucked up shit to other people.  I can't think of anything that had more effect on how I see the world, and have really never had anything like a healthy relationship since then (I'm in my 50s now, already quite a bit older than my father was when he died.)

Kid went nuts!  For ages, he had to hear it, over and over, every time we were in the car, but eventually he forgot about it.  Then, when he was 6 or 7 I got him a cd player and that CD, and he listened to it every night.  Couldn't get him to listen to anything else for the longest time, like a year at least.  He's 11 now.  This is going to break his little heart.","797":"Im a 31 year old dad to a little girl and I cried too. That was a hard day.

My gf didn't sleep much that night and she found out thru eddie Vedder's instagram and she didn't tell me cause she knew how much he meant to me. I was a huge Soundgarden and Audioslave and Temple of the Dog fan and his music shaped my musical taste and was one of the reasons I started singing and writing songs. I toughed it out that day at work and when I got home I grabbed a 6 pack and had a smoke on my back porch when I read this thing my gf sent me on fb. It was about why some people don't realise why it hurts some people so much when you lose someone like a musician you may not have met but has had so much influence in your life. They're your teachers, your philosophers, your rocks that you think are always gonna be there. They were there for you when you were down and helped you thru hard times. Im just paraphrasing but It was really beautiful and when I read that post I just started crying by myself in my porch while my daughter and gf were inside the house. I was never really big into Linkin Park but I know they also had a large fan base of people that looked up to them the way I looked up to Cornell. These guys touched a lot of people with their music and it's just so damn tragic the way their flames burnt out. \nRIP.

Get him out (not forcefully of course) but plan a few fun things to do. I'll say that the worst thing someone can do when they come back would be to sit around in the room and not enjoy their life. \nI was lucky to have excellent friends that know when to back off and let me be, and when to get me out and put a smile on my face.","801":"On an unrelated note, that's why I love this quote by marilyn manson. When asked about what he would have said to the columbine perps: \"I would not have said anything, I would have listened and that's what no one did.\"","802":"Same, and I don't even listen to metal.\n\nBut that Numb mashup with Jay-Z is what got me into rap rock.","803":"This is the most ironic and saddening part. Linkin Park gets made fun of cause of the edgy teens we all were who listened to this stuff, but it probably helped a lot of us out of that same dark hole he was in.

And when they ask for your help actually be there for them.\n\nIt's time we destigmatize mental health.","810":"This is one of my all time favorite albums. It transcends Linkin Park and is its own piece of art. I've got it on. Waiting For The End is the track currently playing.","811":"I mean. For a lot of artists critique is frustrating.

They made it worse when I called them too.","814":"From someone who worked at a crisis\/suicide hotline (not this one, but a local one in my town), and also someone who's dealt with depression and mental illness for 10 years now, I'm so sorry that person handled it that way, and treated you like that. When I was working at the place I worked, we were trained to stay on the phone as long as the person needed us to, and to try to keep them talking if things escalated. It didn't matter if they weren't saying anything, or if they didn't want to talk about how they were feeling and just wanted to talk about something else. If they just wanted to sit there and listen to us speak to them, or if they just wanted to sit in silence, knowing that someone else was on the other end with them, we stayed connected. That call didn't end until the person who called wanted it to end. There were many late nights when I was the only one in the office, and I took calls that lasted an hour or longer, and I was glad to do it if there was even the smallest chance I was helping that other person in some way. I really wish that you would've had that kind of support that you needed that night.\n\nEdit: Wow, thank you so much for the gold! I wasn't expecting that. But, this is my first time getting gold, so I'm glad it was for a comment about something I'm so passionate about and an advocate for :)","815":"I can't find him but there was a redditor that went to a suicide sub here and asked what he should do. He called the suicide hotline and specifically told them he doesnt want to go to a hospital but they called the police anyway. After he got out of crisis, he had a bunch of hospital bills to pay for. That reinforced his decision to die and he hasn't made a comment or post since. I'm gonna try to find him now.\n\nEdit: Found him :(  [This](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/legaladvice\/comments\/69me25\/comment\/dh7olc6?st=J5CW99LK&sh=1e3b48a8) was his last comment.","816":"Jesus dude, I'm so sorry they did that to you. How are you doing these days?","817":"This may sound a bit nutters and it certainly doesn't work for everyone, but when I was going through my bouts of severe depression and suicidal tendencies, I would watch and play all the sad, sappy movies and games. Bittersweet tragedies that made me weep beautiful tears. I don't know what it was about it, but just knowing I wasn't the only one feeling that way and sharing in that primally human experience of sorrow and loss helped me get through some of my hardest moments.","818":"I've heard nothing but bad stories about the hotline. People love to post it because it's an easy way to feel like a hero, but they're probably doing more harm than good.","819":"Which is a shame because the price always rebounds and with a vengeance. Today the price is 2700 for example. ","820":"Man... As a kid I grew up listening to their music. Bought both hybrid theory and was hooked since. Bought meteora the day it came out and binged on it so hard. As time passed I started listening to other types of genres, eventually stopped following them but occasionally checked out their new stuff. Chester was the first person's voice who I could relate to, I always thought I had to have a super masculine singing voice, but when I heard him and how great he sounded in In the end, I started to realise I didn't need to force myself to try to sing in a deeper key just to conform.

He could save others from death...but not himself.\n\nIn all seriousness though, Linkin Park and Chester will be one of maybe 10 bands from the 2000s that will be remembered and go down in history as one of the GOAT. Their fusion of rap, hip-hop, electronica, rock\/hard rock, and metal was never done before, and especially not done on the reach and scale of Linkin Park (RATM did rap rock and Radiohead incorporated electronics into rock with OK Computer but they were more influenced by it than a full genre fusion like Linkin Park).

The spokesman said that continues to be the case in the first 10 days of the Trump administration.\n\n> \"OLC has continued to serve this traditional role in the present administration, and to date has approved the signed orders with respect to form and legality,\" the spokesman said. \n\n> But here's the key part of the statement: \"OLC's legal review has been conducted without the involvement of Department of Justice leadership, and OLC's legal review does not address the broader policy issues inherent in any executive order.\" \n\n> In other words, the Office of Legal Counsel approved the language and basic legality of the executive orders, but did not look at the broader potential impact and potential complications. And DOJ leadership, which in this case means acting Attorney General Sally Yates and others, were not involved in the process at all.\n\nIt's a cursory review with limited scope.

Democracies live and die by the quality of accessible information and understanding of current issues: illiterate and ill-informed voters make illiterate and ill-informed decisions, often voting against public interests because they are ill-informed, allowing outside influences to slowly disintegrate the very freedoms inherent in a democracy. Ensuring fair access to accurate information is a critical part of ensuring the survival of a democracy.\n\nHowever, since the removal of several regulations in the 1980s to make it more \"market-oriented\", the FCC has gradually, systematically, and dangerously veered away from its mission to ensure equal access to reliable information. It has deeply wounded American democracy in the process, and seeks to wound it mortally.\n\nThe FCC was originally bound by a number of regulations - among them, The Fairness Doctrine of 1949. The Fairness Doctrine required television broadcasters, radio stations, and cable providers to both inform the public about important issues, and to do so in an honest, equitable, and balanced way - to expose viewers to opposing viewpoints in a reasonable and truthful manner. The FCC's enforcement of the Fairness Doctrine is responsible for Americans' trust of broadcast and television news. Legally obligating broadcasting license holders to both present critical issues to Americans and to do so in a way that accurately reflected reality ensured that citizens could reasonably expect that they were getting an accurate representation of a given issue when they watched the news. Consumers had no need to seek multiple sources, since those multiple sources would essentially be hitting the same notes on the same issues. Consumers could trust that broadcast networks were accurate, reliable, honest sources of information.\n\nThe Doctrine's removal, and the FCC's subsequent lack of responsibility to uphold broadcast standards, has destroyed the quality broadcasts that built trust in those institutions.\n\nWhen the Fairness Doctrine was effectively eliminated in 1987, and officially eliminated from law in 2011, the FCC was no longer obligated to issue fines to broadcast networks who intentionally represented facts in untruthful or misleading ways. When the Doctrine was eliminated, the FCC was no longer expected to uphold the high standard of communication that had built the American public's confidence and trust in broadcast networks. \n\nThe FCC's failure to enforce communication standards since the 1980s has allowed market pressures to contaminate the quality of news broadcasts. Moreover, broadcast networks became incentivized to ensure that they had the largest audience possible, by any means necessary. As a result, broadcast news networks have become more partisan, more extreme, more reactionary, and focus on their own agendas rather than public interest. This is demonstrated by the razor-sharp partisan divides exhibited by viewership at each of the major broadcast news stations, and the fervor with which those news stations present issues in ways that support their own avaricious agendas rather than the best interests of the American people.\n\nThe FCC ceased to regulate broadcast media against market pressures, and in return, broadcast news has been corrupted by those market pressures.\n\nWithout FCC enforcement of the Fairness Doctrine, TV news networks are now allowed to present current events with whatever partisan or corporate slant they deem most self-serving. They are allowed to misrepresent fact using both misleading \"experts\" on two sides of uncontroversial issues, and one-sided presentations of controversial issues. They are allowed to not report on momentous news regarding American democracy, and instead discuss sensationalist accounts of news for the sole purpose of securing larger crowds of viewers. They are allowed to lie to their viewers in all but letter, and all in the name of profit for the companies that own them.\n\nThe FCC stood passively by and allowed broadcast networks to be corrupted by greed.\n\nBut now, the FCC is ACTIVELY ENCOURAGING corporate interests to corrupt the internet.\n\nIn December 2017, the Chairman of the FCC will hold a vote to overturn the principle of net neutrality. Net neutrality requires that all information be treated equally by internet service providers. In other words, net neutrality prevents ISPs from charging different amounts of money based on the websites a customer visits, the same way that an electric company can't charge a different rate for the electricity to power a microwave than they charge to power a light bulb.\n\nNet neutrality prevents ISPs from charging extra fees to visit certain websites. It prevents ISPs from slowing a customer's internet connection because the customer is using the services of the ISP's competitor. Net neutrality prevents ISPs from charging content providers (such as YouTube, Netflix, The New York Times, and IGN) exorbitant fees to ensure that their content is viewable in the \"fast lane\". It prevents ISPs from blocking websites based on the consumer's ability to pay.\n\nWithout net neutrality, ISPs could charge fees for any imaginable reason.\n\nSince net neutrality is the existing paradigm, it may be difficult to imagine a world where fees are ubiquitous to internet use. Under net neutrality, you pay your monthly subscription fee for internet service. You connect to the internet, and can access anything you find without the ISP charging additional fees based on what you access.\n\nWithout net neutrality, ISPs could charge an extra fee unless you used their brand of modem. They could charge more to access certain websites, or offer subscriptions to the services that they own, so that you don't have to pay additional fees whenever you wanted to access their service. They could squash their competition by forcing content providers to pay exorbitant fees to be offered to the ISP's customers, preventing the growth of non-ISP businesses into the ISP's markets. ISPs could write clauses into their service contracts that terminate your service if you visit certain websites, charging exorbitant fees to reinstate your service.\n\nWithout net neutrality, there is no oversight for what ISPs can and can't charge for. \n\nThe FCC is not only standing aside to let net neutrality be dissolved, but are actively encouraging its dissolution.\n\nIn December, the FCC will hold a vote to to take away our equal access to information, and give that power to the ISPs themselves. If the FCC gives ISPs control over what they provide and what they don't, they will lay the foundation for an America where ISPs control all access to information - holding it hostage until consumers pay whatever price they assign.\n\nIf that's a world where you want to live, sit by and do nothing. The FCC will happily assure you that they have your best interests at heart - as they allow ISPs to line their pockets by selling you your freedom.\n\nBut if you believe that ISPs have no business increasing their profit margins by taking away your freedoms, call your Senators and Congressmen. Remind them that American democracy relies on fair access to information - and without equal access to the internet, there can be no fair access to information.\n\nRemind your legislators the FCC is voting to let ISPs ransom freedoms from the people your legislators were elected to serve and represent.\n\nRemind your legislators that the FCC exists to protect Americans' access to information - not to sell it to the highest bidder.\n\nRemind your legislators to prevent the FCC from overturning net neutrality now - because you might not be able to tell them afterwards.\n\nMore info:\nThe Fairness Doctrine - https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Fairness_Doctrine\n\nThe FCC's History and Mission - https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Federal_Communications_Commission#Mission_and_strategy\n\nThe Best-Case Scenario If Net Neutrality Is Overturned - Portugal - http:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/net-neutrality-portugal-how-american-internet-could-look-fcc-2017-11\n\nWhat Happens When Net Neutrality Is Overturned - The Loss of Business and Consumer Protections, and Reliance on ISPs to Be Trustworthy - https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/national\/what-happens-once-net-neutrality-rules-bite-the-dust\/2017\/11\/22\/d8a50bf2-cfe8-11e7-a87b-47f14b73162a_story.html?utm_term=.552e10266101\n\nReach out to your legislators:\nhttps:\/\/www.whitehouse.gov\/contact\nhttp:\/\/gofccyourself.com\nhttps:\/\/www.senate.gov\/general\/contact_information\/senators_cfm.cfm\nhttps:\/\/www.house.gov\/representatives\n\nTwitter:\n@realDonaldTrump\n@AjitPaiFCC\n@MClyburnFCC\n@mikeofcc","1068":"Can't wait to get a web page when going to NetFlix saying \"NetFlix is unavailable right now because NetFlix won't pay the agreed amount for Comcast subscribers to access Netflix - Please reach out to NetFlix and let them know how important it is to you for Netflix to pay this fee so you can access NetFlix again - Comcast\"\n\n\"If you are Ajit Pai simply enter your super secret code to gain access...\"\n\nedit: added last part","1069":"I am sick to death of everything on this earth being monetized.

Period. End of story. ISPs are notoriously shady, but here are some reassurances Trump's FCC has given us**:\n\n**FTC Privacy Regulation, sec.177 aka Facebook, Reddit, etc. can't snoop on your privacy:**\n\n>Restoring FTC [Federal Trade Commission] jurisdiction over ISPs will enable the FTC to apply its extensive privacy and data security expertise to provide the uniform online privacy protections that consumers expect and deserve.651\n\n**Direct quote from Trump's FCC:  No throttling. FCC release, p.83**\n\n>Many of the largest ISPs (Comcast, AT&T, Verizon, Cox, Frontier, etc.) have committed in this proceeding not to block or throttle legal content.507 These commitments can be enforced by the FTC under Section 5, protecting consumers without imposing public-utility regulation on ISPs.508\n\n**b-but im an ISP I don't wanna be transparent I just wanna bait-and-switch my customers (FCC release p.82):**\n\n>The FTC's unfair-and-deceptive-practices authority \"prohibits companies from selling consumers one product or service but providing them something different,\" which makes voluntary commitments enforceable.502 The FTC also requires the \"disclos[ur]e [of] material information if not disclosing it would mislead the consumer,\" so if an ISP \"failed to disclose blocking, throttling, or other practices that would matter to a reasonable consumer, the FTC's deception authority would apply.\"503\n\n**Specifically good for new media ISPs cannot conspire. (FCC invokes Sherman Act Antitrust Laws, Section 144, p.85, FCC release)**\n\n>Section 1 of the Sherman Act bars contracts, combinations, or conspiracies in restraint of trade, making anticompetitive arrangements illegal. If ISPs reached agreements to unfairly block, throttle, or discriminate against Internet conduct or applications, these agreements would be per seillegal under the antitrust laws.518\n\n**UNLIMITED NETFLIX, and other video sources (Yes this includes porn) **\n\n>If an ISP that also sells video services degrades the speed or quality of competing \"Over the Top\" video services (such as Netflix),526 that conduct could be challenged as anticompetitive foreclosure.\n\n**Here's the big one.  Free Press was pushing hard to mess up the network's ability to regulate and wanted to censor it hard.  This won't happen under Trump's FCC (THANK GOD)**\n\n>We also conclude that the Commission should have been cautioned against reclassifying broadband Internet access service as a telecommunications service in 2015 because doing so involved \"laying claim to extravagant statutory power over the national economy ...\"\n\n**And this is the big one.  Unlike Obama's net neutrality this new system would not only allow competitors to self regulate but if they *DO* misbehave the FTC would destroy them.**\n\n>176.We also reject AT&T's assertion that the Commission should conditionally forbear from all Title II regulations as a preventive measure to address the contingency that a future Commission might seek to reinstate the Title II Order.647 Although AT&T explains that \"conditional forbearance would provide an extra level of insurance against the contingency that a future, politically motivated Commission might try to reinstate a 'common carrier' classification [2015 Net Neutrality Regulations],\"648 we see no need to address the complicated question of prophylactic forbearance and find such extraordinary measures [are] unnecessary.\n\nTLDR\n\n*    Regulatory rollback throwback to 90's.\n\n*    FCC claims the 2015 Regulations gave the government \"extravagant statutory power over the national economy\". \n\n*    Regulatory oversight of the ISP industry shifts back to FTC (Federal Trade Commission) as it has been since the invention of the internet.\n\n*    FCC is enforcing against throttling, censorship, restriction, etc. by invoking consumer protection and anti-trust laws (via FTC).\n\n*    If ISPs collectively conspire to paywall a content-provider, they are subject to FTC anti-trust penetration.\n\n*    FCC has reduced its own jurisdiction, because they're typically geared toward stricter and narrower regulations (censoring profanity on the radio, cable, etc.) as opposed to regulating the entire internet service-provider industry.\n\n*    FCC repeatedly acknowledges that its new policy is deliberately business-friendly in hopes to expand the economy (internet plays a huge role obviously). Acknowledges that potential abuse of this friendliness will result in stricter policy.\n\n*    America has some of the shittiest internet in the world because our infrastructure is antiquated and fiber-optic trenching projects keep getting killed. Hopefully this provides the investment needed to fix that. Better infrastructure means faster speeds and cheaper service.\n\n*    [THIS IS A BIG ONE]  Remember all the Congressmen who wanted to sell out our personal information earlier this year?

Bush. At the time, Reagan was beginning to exhibit what his son Ron now describes as early signs of Alzheimer's, and his age and acuity were becoming a central issue in the campaign.\n\n>But in 1993 Ailes inked a secret deal with tobacco giants Philip Morris and RJ Reynolds to go full-force after the Clinton administration on its central policy objective: health care reform.\n\n>Hillarycare was to have been funded, in part, by a $1-a-pack tax on cigarettes. To block the proposal, Big Tobacco paid Ailes to produce ads highlighting \"real people affected by taxes.\"\n\n>According to internal memos, Ailes also explored how Philip Morris could create a phony front group called the \"Coalition for Fair Funding of Health Care\" to deploy the same kind of \"independent\" ads that produced Willie Horton. In a precursor to the modern Tea Party, Ailes conspired with the tobacco companies to unleash angry phone calls on Congress - cold-calling smokers and patching them through to the switchboards on Capitol Hill - and to gin up the appearance of a grassroots uprising, busing 17,000 tobacco employees to the White House for a mass demonstration. \"RJR has trained 200 people to call in to shows,\" a March 1993 memo revealed. \"A packet has gone to Limbaugh.

But I do have some questions regarding those reassurances:\n\n* What necessity exists for an ISP being able to block lawful traffic in a way that is not anti-competitive?\n\n* What happens when ISPs are behaving in a way that are intrinsically difficult to prove as being anti-competitive? For example, when they throttle VOIP traffic to a degraded but not strictly unusable level, which affects only their competitors, but  they make a thin case that they're doing so for the health of their network as a whole, what recourse is there?\n\n* What stops an ISP from offlining a server that hosts content that is critical of their business practices? ISPs are under no obligation to uphold the free press on their private networks, and such a move can't necessarily be construed as anti-competitive.\n\n* What stops ISPs from prioritizing the traffic of paying content subscribers above the traffic of content subscribers who haven't paid?\n\n* What is the wisdom of a \"regulatory rollback throwback to 90s\" when prior to 2015's Open Internet Order we were regulating broadband carriers under **2010** rules? Why is winding the clock back an additional 20 years wise, when our understanding of the internet and our understanding of the behavior of ISPs has evolved so much since then?\n\nAnd when you say:\n\n> Everyone here agrees that ISPs should not throttle\/paywall\/censor\/restrict our content. Period. End of story.\n\n* If we all agree the behavior is not acceptable, why do you feel the investigative arm of the FTC is equipped to handle abuse in a timely manner as opposed to simply banning the behavior? Isn't funding and growing an department of the government to meet this new demand actually soliciting *more* hands on government control?\n\n* What is the wisdom in allowing them to throttle\/paywall\/censor\/restrict our content, when the recourse becomes *potentially* sanctioning them after the fact? Why should we allow the merits of the issue to be discussed in closed court rooms by well funded teams of ISP lawyers years after the abuse is committed?\n\n* It's not widely reported, but American internet actually entered the top 10 in terms of average broadband speeds in Q1 2017, due in large part to ongoing devotion to our nation's infrastructure - this ongoing devotion which, for all intents and purposes, wasn't affected by the NN ruling, as we experienced a 22% YoY growth compared to Q1 2016. This period, as you know, was entirely during our existing NN regulations. I'm not sure I follow the that repealing NN will have an appreciable affect on infrastructure improvement. Could you help me understand this line of reasoning?\n\n* On \"the big one\" - Do you have a source for FTC's consumer privacy protection regulations that bring you such relief, so that we may read what that entails? As far as I'd understood, the FTC's privacy regulations basically involve making sure companies keep their promises - if they notify us that they're going to sell our information in their service contracts, what in the FTC regulations stops them?\n\nThank you for reading, I hope to better understand your point of view on this subject.","1122":"But in a true free market Comcast and AT&T would fail.

Obviously,the larger company would have it in their interest to ensure their stuff gets top priority. Then the only way to really compete is to get equally large,which is probably practically impossible for anyone who wasn't there when the expansion race started. Someone might cry that the regulations prevent normal business operation- and on a \"traditional\" scale that would be true,interference would be unfair.

We're protesting nationwide on Dec 7th to stop them. Head over to http:\/\/www.verizonprotests.com\/ for more info.\n\nAlso there is a March on DC at https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/marchfornetneutrality\n\nWHAT'S HAPPENING? The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) just announced its plan to slash net neutrality rules, allowing ISPs like Verizon to block apps, slow websites, and charge fees to control what you see & do online. They vote December 14th. People from across the political spectrum are outraged, so we're planning to protest at Verizon retail stores across the country on December 7, one week before the vote and at the peak of the busy Holiday shopping season. We'll demand that our members of Congress take action to stop Verizon's puppet FCC from killing net neutrality.\n\nWHAT'S NET NEUTRALITY? Net neutrality is the basic principle that has made the Internet into what it is today. It prevents big Internet Service Providers (like Verizon) from charging extra fees, engaging in censorship, or controlling what we see and do on the web by throttling websites, apps, and online services.\n\nWHY VERIZON STORES? The new chairman of the FCC, Ajit Pai, is a former top lawyer for Verizon, and the company has been spending millions on lobbying and lawsuits to kill net neutrality so they can gauge us all for more money. By protesting at Verizon stores, we're shining light on the corruption and demanding that our local do something about it. Only Congress has the power to stop Verizon's puppet FCC, so at the protests we'll be calling and tweeting at legislators, and in cities where it's possible we'll march from Verizon stores to lawmakers offices.\n\nWHAT ARE OUR DEMANDS? Ajit Pai is clearly still working for Verizon, not the public. But he still has to answer to Congress. So we're calling on our lawmakers to do their job overseeing the FCC and speak out against Ajit Pai's plan to gut Title II net neutrality protections and give Verizon and other giant ISPs everything on their holiday wishlist. \n\nHOW CAN I JOIN? Click here http:\/\/www.verizonprotests.com\/ and you'll find an interactive map where you can see if there is already a protest planned near you. If not, you can sign up to host one, and we'll send you materials to make it easy and help you recruit others in your area. These protests will be quick, fun, and 100% legal. If you can't attend a protest on December 7th, you can still help defend net neutrality by calling your lawmakers and spreading the word on social media. You can also sign up to host a meeting with your members of Congress, or volunteer for our texting team to help turn people out for these protests.\n\n","1179":"2nd form of ID.

According to the Succession Act of 1947, the Speaker of the House is in line to become President after the Vice President--true.

It all hinges on the definition of the word \"officer.\"  In the Constitution, \"Officer\" is a term of art that most plausibly should be interpreted as an \"Officer of the United States,\" which in and of itself is a specific term with a very specific meaning.  What's pertinent is that the Speaker of the House is not, under this definition, an Officer of the United States.  \n\nIf it ever came down to it, and the Speaker was actually going to become President, it's almost guaranteed that the opposing party would file suit in the SCOTUS, and there's a strong case to be made that the SCOTUS should strike that language from the Act.  \n\nFor a more detailed background, see [this](http:\/\/digitalcommons.law.yale.edu\/cgi\/viewcontent.cgi?article=1959&context=fss_papers) article in the *Stanford Law Review*.  \n\nEDIT: Someone made a good point below that whether the opposing party would file suit is more a function of whether it'd be politically expedient.

Turns out, that lady was Bettie Page. Once a week, Hefner would have his driver pick her up so they could hang out at his mansion and watch movies and shit. One day, she invited my friend and I to go with her. Hefner seemed nice. The mansion was pretty empty, though. It wasn't like naked women were randomly walking around or anything. After about 45 minutes, he asked his driver to take me and my friend back to his apartment. My friend was a bit disappointed we couldn't stay longer. I was just happy to meet Hugh Hefner.\n\nOn another note, my buddy ended up having to tell Ms. Page that he couldn't get her groceries anymore.

At the time, I was a virulent feminist and the Playboy building was in Chicago where I lived. I saw Hef standing at his residence in Chicago at that time . He was a short guy, holding a martini in front of his Gold Coast home. I was always appalled back then , and if you were a woman back then you threw your anger at guys like Hefner and other men who you thought were misogynistic fellows. Well, I mellowed with time, and I think of all of the great articles and brilliant essays that Playboy printed, and my feelings towards Hef and his magazine became more comical and I left that stage of anger to recognize the magazine as a terrific mouthpiece for the civil rights movement at the time, and the forum for writers and artists to show their ideas. I.E., I stopped disliking Hefner and saw him as just a person who had grown up, as I had, in the repressed 1950s, when it was taboo to be so many things. His porn is mild and silly to me now, and I recognize, despite his weirdness for dressing women as rabbits, his contributions to the world of literary brilliance. He published things no one would publish at the time. Believe me, you had to live in the 50s to see how daring his magazine was...including the porn, which now merely looks to me like any catalogue for Victoria's Secret.  So, well, good journey to you , Hef. Thanks for the articles. Yep , I bought your magazine for the articles...for real...signed, Grandmother now and former angry little feminist. Now I just laugh at my former self and hope all your rabbit ladies had good pension plans.

If you know anything about Linda's story, she was horribly abused and forced into prostitution by her scum bag boyfriend. Deep Throat made millions and she made a few hundred dollars. Her boyfriend forced her to do a dog porno at gunpoint. And when they went to the mansion for a party after Deep Throat came out, her boyfriend told Hugh Hefner about how he could get a dog to have sex with her. I guess he was extremely eager and into it, so he brought them to a room where him and the boyfriend watched as they attempted to get the dog to have sex with Linda. At this point Linda had learned to scare the dog off in a subtle way, so that her boyfriend wouldn't beat her after. I don't know who provided the dog, but it was at the mansion and I doubt they brought a dog to his party. \n\nThe other part that creeped me out about Hugh is that he wouldn't let the Holly, Kendra, and Bridget leave to see their families like ever. The families had to come there. I recall one of them saying they weren't allowed to leave for a family trip. And when they left the mansion they had to tell security where they were going and it was recorded. They also had curfews every day. I remember the girls had to do a trip to Vegas in one episode and I just remember them being really nervous about getting back on time. I think they were only gone for the day or 24 hours but they couldn't stay longer than that otherwise they would be kicked out or in trouble.

Everyone knows Hugh as the old, robed dude that lives in a mansion with a bunch of models but he's somewhat of a personal hero of mine for his contributions to literature and civil rights. In Playboy's heyday they published *everybody* of note, as long as the story had something to say. The counter-culture of the 60s thrived due in part to Hugh's love of the truths we find in story.\n\nKerouac, Murakami, tons of the sci-fi greats like Atwood, Bradbury, and Asimov,  ALL published in Playboy. He even published my all-time favorite author, Kurt Vonnegut, which is why I have [a single vintage Playboy](https:\/\/www.antichay.com\/pictures\/medium\/22318.jpg) on my bookshelf.

For those that don't know, \"The Crooked Man\" takes place in a world where homosexuality is the norm and heterosexuals are oppressed. It naturally causes a media stir and when asked about it, Hugh simply replied \"If it was wrong to persecute heterosexuals in a homosexual society, then the reverse was wrong, too.\"\n\nHugh's best known for building a media empire out of tits but his contributions to the literary world, counter-culture, and civil rights movements has made him a legendary American icon, or at least he is to me.","1457":"It started to fall off, as did a lot of literary magazines. But Playboy, I think, lost some of it's bite when the libertarianism that had been essential to securing a voice for the magazine was no longer important to it. Younger readers didn't realize the fight that Hefner had gone through to develop prestige for a magazine with naked women and thought, when they first saw it, that the politics we're a little ham-handed. \n\nAt least, that's how it was for me. But as a teenager I still picked it up whenever there was a new Updike, or Palahniuk, or King story. \n\nEdit: thinking a little more about it - I got older and more pretentious and stopped reading those writers. But I never really questioned the quality of writing in Playboy the way I did other magazines, I think because I knew it was the only place a lot of men were getting any sort of literature. It was like Oprah's Book Club for men, but the sort of men who specifically don't spend their days talking about what they've read lately.

He even put our band in a 6 page article in his magazine because of his love for our friend (we felt we were good, but not that good :)  \n  \nAnyway, my mom bought that mag (way over a decade ago), because she happened to be excite that her son was in a magazine.

My mom cut out all the offensive pages and left just us and the other articles so that my little brother could read it.  \n  \nAnyway, I came to say that it seemed to me like the tameness of Playboy was the opposite of what was rumored to happen at the mansion. And - at least in the 2000's, well past the prime of the mag, the harder core of Penthouse was in contrast to the total tame residence that was Guccione's residence in NYC. It was a multi-story museum that housed lots and lots of fine art. There was even a golden colored piano that was said to be Judy Garland's.  Bob's big thing was conversation.

FUCK","1503":"I've seen a lot of people ask how the Supreme Court has the authority to decide this issue for states. For those interested, I am an American lawyer and I can answer that question with some insight.\n\nYes, the Supreme Court does have the authority to make sweeping decisions that invalidate any and all state laws which conflict with its ruling. The Supreme Court finds this authority in the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution and from the very significant court case of *Marybury vs. Madison* which more or less established the Supreme Court's absolute authority to literally \"say what the law is.\"\n\nStates do have autonomy to decide certain issues for themselves. These are judicial notions of 'comity' and 'parity,' the idea that state governments are better equipped to deal with local and regional issues rather than a distant Congress in Washington. In fact, the laws of contracts traditionally belong to states, which is why every state in the U.S. has slight legal differences in how contracts are formed, enforced, written, etc. Marriage, in its most basic legal form, is a contract entered into by two consenting adults, which is why marriage laws have been decided by state legislatures and state courts.\n\nBut there's an important amendment to the U.S. Constitution that (as of today) strips away the right of a state to define marriage in their laws as a union between one man and one woman: the Fourteenth Amendment (and more specifically the Equal Protection Clause) which states:\n\n> No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\n \nWithout getting too much into the nuances of the Supreme Court's varying standards of review (although I certainly can if you're interested), the Supreme Court traditionally reviews Equal Protection issues under what's called a 'rational basis review.' It is the most permissive standard the Court can adopt--that is, it is the least difficult standard to meet in order to successfully defend a law from being struck down. The review asks whether a law is rationally related to a legitimate government interest. With respect to the issue of marriage equality, the question is: Are state laws banning same-sex marriage rationally related to the legitimate government interest of protecting the institution of marriage?\n\nTo that question the Supreme Court has apparently said 'no.' The fact that the Supreme Court today could not find any rational basis for these state bans related to the stated goal of protecting the institution of marriage says *a lot*. The Court is literally saying there is no rational relationship between banning same-sex marriage and protecting marriage. Thus, same-sex marriage bans are unconstitutional under the Fourteenth Amendment, and every such law in the United States is immediately invalidated.\n\nThe Supreme Court has made sweeping judgments like this before, although decisions of this magnitude are quite rare. For examples, see *Brown vs. Board of Education* (which held that state laws enacting racial segregation were unconstitutional) and *Loving vs. Virginia* (which held that state laws banning interracial marriage were unconstitutional).\n\nTL;DR: Yes, the Supreme Court has the authority to say what the law is for the entire nation. Yes, marriage is traditionally an area kept to state law, but only up to a limit until a law runs headlong into the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause.\n\n**Important Edit:** It appears I've disseminated some amount of disinformation for which I apologize (I did not get around to actually reading the full opinion until now). As pointed out to me by \/u\/Armonster20, the Supreme Court **DID NOT** review this case under rational basis. Rather, it was decided under a strict scrutiny review. The majority opinion does not even make much mention at all of the words \"sexual orientation,\" instead focusing on the fundamental right of marriage. A lot of you have asked about the varying standards of review, but I must confess that constitutional law is outside my usual day-to-day practice and I'm doing the best I can to remember the basics I learned in law school. I could try to explain the standards of review in detail but I'm afraid of saying something inaccurate. The least I can do is direct you **[here](http:\/\/blogs.findlaw.com\/law_and_life\/2014\/01\/challenging-laws-3-levels-of-scrutiny-explained.html)**.\n\nBut to go into just a little more detail, the strict scrutiny test is the most demanding standard of review to which the Supreme Court can subject a law. The reason the Supreme Court chose to review this case under this very exacting test is quite logical actually: the Supreme Court has previously said that any law that abridges a \"fundamental right\" must meet the most demanding scrutiny, and the Supreme Court has previously deemed the right to marry as a fundamental right. Thus, because any state law that excludes an entire class of people from participating in marriage obviously implicates the fundamental right to marry, we get strict scrutiny. (FYI - Another fundamental right under the Constitution is the right to have an abortion.)\n\nWhat this means is that the majority made it damn-near impossible for the respondents (i.e., the states defending their same-sex marriage bans) to win in this case. What this does NOT mean is that any future LGBT issues will be given the same standard review, unless they of course deal with marriage. Most likely, any future litigation on LGBT issues will be subject to rational basis review or something that's informally been called \"rational basis review with a bite\"--a standard somewhere between normal rational basis and intermediate scrutiny.","1504":"The final two paragraphs of the Court's opinion:\n\n> No union is more profound than marriage, for it embodies\nthe highest ideals of love, fidelity, devotion, sacrifice,\nand family.

The generations that wrote and ratified the Bill of Rights and the Fourteenth Amendment did not presume to know the extent of freedom in all of its dimensions, and so they entrusted to future generations a charter protecting the right of all persons to enjoy liberty as we learn its meaning.  When new insight reveals discord between the Constitution's central protections and a received legal stricture, a claim to liberty must be addressed\n\n> * Many who deem same-sex marriage to be wrong reach that conclusion based on decent and honorable religious or philosophical premises, and neither they nor their beliefs are disparaged here. But when that sincere, personal opposition becomes enacted law and public policy, the necessary consequence is to put the imprimatur of the State itself on an exclusion that soon demeans or stigmatizes those whose own liberty is then denied. \n\n> * No union is more profound than marriage, for it embodies the highest ideals of love, fidelity, devotion, sacrifice, and family. In forming a marital union, two people become something greater than once they were. As some of the petitioners in these cases demonstrate, marriage embodies a love that may endure even past death. It would misunderstand these men and women to say they disrespect the idea of marriage.

Their hope is not to be condemned to live in loneliness, excluded from one of civilization's oldest institutions. They ask for equal dignity in the eyes of the law. The Constitution grants them that right.\n\n**Highlights from the Roberts Dissent**\n\n> * When decisions are reached through democratic means, some people will inevitably be disappointed with the results. But those whose views do not prevail at least know that they have had their say, and accordingly are--in the tradition of our political culture--reconciled to the result of a fair and honest debate. ... But today the Court puts a stop to all that. By deciding this question under the Constitution, the Court removes it from the realm of democratic decision. There will be consequences to shutting down the political process on an issue of such profound public significance. Closing debate tends to close minds. People denied a voice are less likely to accept the ruling of a court on an issue that does not seem to be the sort of thing courts usually decide.\n\n> * If you are among the many Americans--of whatever sexual orientation--who favor expanding same-sex marriage, by all means celebrate today's decision. Celebrate the achievement of a desired goal. Celebrate the opportunity for a new expression of commitment to a partner. Celebrate the availability of new benefits. But do not celebrate the Constitution. It had nothing to do with it.\n\n**Highlights from the Scalia Dissent**\n\n> * This is a naked judicial claim to legislative--indeed, super-legislative--power; a claim fundamentally at odds with our system of government.\n\n> * But what really astounds is the hubris reflected in today's judicial Putsch.\n\n> * If, even as the price to be paid for a fifth vote, I ever joined an opinion for the Court that began: \"The Constitution promises liberty to all within its reach, a liberty that includes certain specific rights that allow persons, within a lawful realm, to define and express their identity,\" I would hide my head in a bag.

The fundamental\nright to marry does not include a right to make\na State change its definition of marriage. And a State's\ndecision to maintain the meaning of marriage that has\npersisted in every culture throughout human history can\nhardly be called irrational. In short, our Constitution does\nnot enact any one theory of marriage. The people of a\nState are free to expand marriage to include same-sex\ncouples, or to retain the historic definition.\n\n> Today, however, the Court takes the extraordinary step\nof ordering every State to license and recognize same-sex\nmarriage. Many people will rejoice at this decision, and I\nbegrudge none their celebration. But for those who believe\nin a government of laws, not of men, the majority's approach\nis deeply disheartening.

Perhaps there's more funding for public services in these cities, though it's hard to say which public services would be leading to these gains in low-income life expectancy.\n\nhttp:\/\/www.vox.com\/2016\/4\/13\/11420230\/life-expectancy-income\n\n>Meanwhile, life-saving practices that have become widely accepted in other affluent countries -- and in a few states, notably California -- have yet to take hold in many American hospitals.\n>\n>As the maternal death rate has mounted around the U.S., a small cadre of reformers has mobilized. Some of the earliest and most important work has come in California, where more babies are born than in any other state --500,000 a year, one-eighth of the U.S. total.\n>\n>Modeled on the U.K. process, the California Maternal Quality Care Collaborative is informed by the experiences of founder Elliott Main, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Stanford and the University of California-San Francisco, who for many years ran the ob\/gyn department at a San Francisco hospital.\n>\n>Launched a decade ago, CMQCC aims to reduce not only mortality, but also life-threatening complications and racial disparities in obstetric care. It began by analyzing maternal deaths in the state over several years; in almost every case, it discovered, there was \"at least some chance to alter the outcome.\" The most preventable deaths were from hemorrhage (70 percent) and preeclampsia (60 percent).\n>\n>Hospitals that adopted the toolkit saw a 21 percent decrease in near deaths from maternal bleeding in the first year; hospitals that didn't use the protocol had a 1.2 percent reduction. By 2013, according to Main, maternal deaths in California fell to around 7 per 100,000 births, similar to the numbers in Canada, France and the Netherlands -- a dramatic counter to the trends in other parts of the U.S.\n\nhttp:\/\/www.npr.org\/2017\/05\/12\/527806002\/focus-on-infants-during-childbirth-leaves-u-s-moms-in-danger\n\n>Collectively, the colleges, institutions, and alumni of the University of California make it the most comprehensive and advanced postsecondary educational system **in the world**, responsible for nearly $50 billion per year of economic impact.[4] UC campuses have large numbers of distinguished faculty in almost every academic discipline, with UC faculty and researchers having won **62 Nobel Prizes as of 2016.[5] UC campuses are perennially ranked highly** by various publications.

It's a very personal process that involves the breeder being able to turn down applicants they don't think will take proper care of their animals. Pet stores rarely vet or turn down customers, so I don't think any responsible breeders are hurt by this.","1691":"If you don't live in California, you probably dont realize just how many dogs and cats are put to sleep there - its on the order of hundreds of thousands of animals per year.\n\nANY breeding in California contributes to overpopulation.

They are social animals and require a lot of bonding, whether with another bird or their owner. They are also very playful and desire a lot of stimulation which can come from either just scratching and petting and close body contact to many toys and a lot of room to fly. It just kind of depends on the bird and species. For instance I've seen some cockatoos that are very energetic and require a lot of stimulation from places to perch and fly around to toys to play with and destroy. And then I've seen some [golden macaws](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/parrots\/comments\/5o68bn\/everybody_meet_riley_met_her_last_week_at\/) that are so well behaved and content enough with being around the owner for affection that they can just roam outside with said owner without a leash or harness.\n\n\nOverall parrots and birds are animals that require a lot of time, care, and affection for if you want them to live happy healthy lives. It can depend on the bird species as some are more manageable than others. The biggest factor in owning a bird will always be the social aspect though as without that social aspect birds have been and can turn aggressive or depressive if they are separated from their owner or close bird friends for a while (It's not like a dog where they think if you are gone for a few hours it's the end of a world. it's more like a gradual process over the course of days, weeks, and months). But trust me, I honestly feel like birds are some of the most rewarding pets to have if you know what you are doing. Dogs are great, cats can cuddle, sneks can boop, and fish...fish...but something about birds and parrots to me is just so much better than the others.","1708":"Oh my god I fucking hate swap meet and flea market pet stores because they make me so sad. Yeah the cages are cheap and big and probably the only thing I'd buy, but I would NOT want to support them if their parrots look like that. They all look sad or depressed or mentally angry with a lot of pulled feathers or broken beaks. One of the saddest I saw was a toucan who was missing the front portion of their upper bill and he was just hitting his cage walls over and over with his beak. In fact his beak was dull looking and his coat was matted and unglossy. I've seen pet toucans before and when properly cared for they are fantastic birds (Thank you Magnolia Bird Farm in Riverside!) Their coats are nice and shiny, their beaks are vibrant, and their behavior is playful with constantly jumping around their cages, flying places with a passion, and playfully bitting at your hands and fingers in a soft manner. It just...made me sad.","1709":"For some larger birds I have heard that it is like having a 3 year old human child that never grows up in terms of intellectual and emotional needs.","1710":"As someone with a pet bird that I love dearly, I agree. Sometimes I wish birds had never been adopted as pets.\n\nPractically, though, there are so many older birds with no ability to live in the wild for a whole lot of reasons. Their owners die and there are no friends or relatives willing to take them in, they are poorly socialized and their owners get rid of them, they bond to one person and attack all others and their owners get rid of them, their veterinary care is ridiculously expensive and their owners get rid of them, the owners realize that pet birds bite and scream at ear piercing volumes and require constant attention and get rid of them. \n\nFor these reasons I would LOVE to see bird ownership restricted to adoption and have breeding phased out. When I adopted my guy I had to do a certain number of volunteer hours at the rescue (so worth it, and a really brilliant requirement), they did multiple interviews and at least two home visits and I spent a lot of time interacting with the birds under supervision to make sure that the bird and I were good matches for each other.","1711":"> It's a ban on sales for profit.\n\nIt's a ban on sales for profit at pet stores.

The dogs in mills aren't ever going to be pet store stock. They are breeding animals and they are frequently ugly. Mill owners don't care if their ears get infected, their toes drop off from the wire floors of their cages, their legs break, their fur falls out, their teeth fall out or anything else that doesn't endanger their lives or endanger their ability to produce litter after litter of cute puppies. \n\nWhen a mill goes under or the animals are no longer useful, the animals are auctioned off to other mills or killed. Frequently with a gun or other cheap method. Sometimes rescues buy the dogs from the auctions. The mill owners don't care who buys the dogs, it's all money in their pockets so they don't discourage rescues from buying the animals. In fact, rescue bidding against other mill operators drives the price of the dog up so the mills sometimes actually start breeding for rescue. \n\nIf the USDA shuts down a mill the dogs are confiscated and taken in by various animal welfare groups. Sometimes shelters, sometimes rescue, sometimes both. It's a huge burden for the groups dealing with the influx of dogs because they are all in very poor health and frequently they've never been handled except harshly. They are sometimes very difficult to bring around and getting them to a place where they can be a family member instead of a terrorized and terrified creature can take years. \n\nIt's heartbreaking but the breeding stock in a mill look more like gargoyles than like dogs. If you have a strong stomach google it. But I warn you, it'll break your heart and you'll never look at a pet store puppy again without seeing the image of its suffering mother still in the mill.

Hens have a relatively short working life, so we need to let them hatch once in a while, and half of the chicks will be male.\n\nI don't really know what to do about that *except* to eat the males, feed them to a dog, etc., any of which would beat the callous solution your disgusting local meat farm employs: on a conveyor belt into a grinder and dead.","1719":">intelligent\n\nHahahaha, no. Don't get me wrong, my favorite pet was a rabbit, but they are far from smart. Holy shit they are dumb. Case and point, while my rabbit was in her cage (which was just used as a litter box with one side permanently open) I offered her a treat. Rather than exit the cage and go around, she would smash her face through the wire and attempt to eat the treat. Even if she could reach the treat, she couldn't actually eat it, since she would have her mouth wrapped around the metal frame of the cage.\n\nTL;DR: rabbits are wonderful loving pets with distinct personalities, but intelligent is one of the last words I would use to describe them.","1720":"With the growing demand for designer breeds (anything ending in -doodle), I feel like the blackmarket for pure-bred specialty breeds will boom. ","1721":"Pet shops might be able to source some puppies from backyard breeders, but there's no way they can get the volume of puppies they need without puppy mills. Pretty much by definition, a reputable breeder is one who screens potential owners closely and will take the dog back if the placement doesn't work. That model just doesn't work for pet shops. And without puppy mills, they can't keep up with fads in dog breeds, like all the people who want husky puppies after watching Game of Thrones. \n\nI live in a place that passed a law like this a while ago, and pet stores just stopped selling dogs and cats for a profit. The big chain stores made agreements with local shelters to display available shelter cats and host dog-adoption events, but the animals still belong to the shelter until adopted. The store makes money on it because they can sell a bunch of toys and accessories to the adopter and pitch their grooming and training services. The smaller stores that primarily sold puppies and kittens either closed down or switched to a \"small animals and pet supplies\" business model. ","1722":"Yeah. I would say people who can't handle an animal shelter, should just not get a pet. They are not accessories; they are living feeling animals. ","1723":"Yup. Many shelters don't have the resources to care for an unadoptable animal for its entire life. Also, state laws can make it illegal to adopt out animals with certain diseases, making the unadoptable ratio even higher. Also, I'm guessing that lots of no-kill shelters are limited admission, so they're turning away animals in need.","1724":"I can't even imagine getting a dog from a breeder. All my dogs now are rescues....well, rescues from the street, rescued from the guy that was gonna take them to the pound etc... Full breeds seem to just be TOO much of one thing. \nTOO hyper, TOO barky, TOO protective. I like the mutts. ","1725":"I spent time time in a low kill shelter years ago. Their unwanted animals will live out the rest of their healthy life there, but will be put down due to age\/injury\/illness.","1726":"I'm currently fostering an unadoptable senior dog. He literally spent the first 9 years of his life in a filthy cage. As a result of the abuse he has spinal issues, weak legs, and a broken sphincter, meaning he shits the bed every night. He would have been killed pretty quickly at a shelter, but now he will be able to live out his days among our pets, treated like one of the family. He never had dog toys before coming to our house, and is only now learning how to play a little bit. He loves sleeping with his stuffed ducky, and despite everything he's suffered through at the hands of humans, he's a super gentle and loving dog. ","1727":"I have 2 cats now, but once i own a house i'd love to get a puppy. I don't care if it's from the humane society or a breeder, as long as it's a puppy. Not because puppies are cuter than older dogs, but because I feel that I would want the puppy to \"grow into\" our family. And be able to get along with our skiddish cats. I feel that bringing a full grown dog might be a bad idea knowing that shelter dogs often have behavioral issues or an unknown background. If i didn't have cats already I wouldn't have a problem adopting an older dog. \n\nI don't see a problem with person getting a dog from a breeder for a specific breed they want. As long as the breeder is responsible and not just pushing puppies out for profit like puppy mills.

Won't a ton of dog breeds becomes extremely rare if not vanish if that happens nation wide and most people neuter there dogs?\n\nNothing against shelters but sometimes you want a dog a specific breed, and if your local shelter doesn't have said breed tough luck? ","1730":"I have 2 cats that I got as strays, barely weeks old. They are sisters and therefore get along great. They are the most loving, docile pets ever. Almost like dogs, they won't leave me alone when I'm home. It's like they know you rescued them.  ","1731":"If they try to mark up the prices on the pets, people will just get them at the shelter and the store will lose money because they have to pay to feed and house the animals.\n\nAnd pets from the shelter almost never have \"papers\" to artificially jack the price up. They are just \"dogs\" or \"cats.\"\n","1732":"Considering how easy it is to place a puppy or kitten, there's no way a shelter is going to let a pet store take more than a few of them at any given time.","1733":"No. Pet stores in CA already do things this way - this isn't new. California pet stores (at least, any that I have seen all over the state, it could be different in some areas that I haven't been to but I've been to a lot of them) already don't sell mill puppies\/kittens. They already have agreements with rescues and shelters. The adoption fees are the same as from the rescue\/shelter - the store doesn't profit off the adoption. It benefits the pet store because then the person adopting the animal buys the new pet supplies at the pet store since they are already there. ","1734":"Pet Co and petsmart near me only ever have a section where a rescue group is represented and has some dogs and cats available for adoption, no sales. They do sell birds and rodents etc","1735":"I haven't seen dogs or cats sold in pet stores in years, you find birds, snakes, rodents, but not the big 2. I didn't know it was still legal anyway.","1736":"No, pet stores in CA already do this. Shelters and rescues set up agreements with pet stores and it works out well for everyone. The pet stores see it as their way of appearing charitable, and they benefit because the people who adopt the pets then go buy the supplies in the store. The cost of the pet is the same as it would cost to adopt directly from the shelter or the rescue. The pet stores don't profit off the adoption.","1737":"Shitty breeders are just as likely to produce aggressive dogs. It can be bred in.\n\nGood breeders don't do this. If they do they aren't good breeders.\n\nAnd with shelters, you kind of do know what you are getting if the shelter is doing a half decent job of screening the dogs. My local shelter and rescues mostly use foster homes so they have a pretty good idea of how dogs will actually act in a real home.","1738":"I have worked in dog rescue for a long time and I want to clarify that a lot is really the extreme minority. We have seen literally thousands of animals over the years at my current shelter and very few have serious issues. Most are dogs that come from homes that have been abandoned because someone dies or someone gets a boyfriend or someone moves or someone gets a puppy and a 5 year old dog isn't cute anymore. We also get tons upon tons of puppies-just oodles of them, all the time, who do not have serious issues either. ","1739":"I think it's crazy how many people don't check shelters first, though.  When I was looking to adopt cats, I browsed through several websites where rescues and shelters could list their animals, and I could filter by breed, gender, coat length, coat color, eye color, even disposition on some sites.  It only took about two months of casual browsing and contemplation before I stumbled upon the perfect little pair of kitties.\n\nI understand some people are really into certain breeds and want X breed from Y breeder, but I also think it definitely makes sense to browse shelters first, and many people don't realize what kind of amazing selection you can get from rescues.\n\nEvery organization I contacted when I tried to adopt asked me my preference in breed, eye color, coat color, etc and matched me with relatively suitable animals.  It's truly amazing what sort of creatures you can find on rescue sites.\n\nAdopting from these shelters is like the perfect combination of \"common sense\" and \"moral sense.\"\n","1740":"To be fair, you should never buy a dog like that at a pet store, but directly from the breeder. ","1741":"Unfortunately, if folks are looking for a specific breed because of characteristics of that breed, buying from a pet store\/puppy mill is NOT the best way to succeed. Mill-bred dogs are not bred well and typically will have more health issues, in addition to being difficult to house-train. ","1742":"does nothing to stop someone from getting a dog from a breeder, just they won't be going to a retail environment. Which I think is perfectly fair, a good breeder probably wouldn't be working with a petshop anyway.","1743":"I live in the San Diego area and all cat adoptions are certainly less than $100. Free under certain conditions.","1744":"Shelters and PetShops in California already do this for cats, and that's not whats been happening at all. They cycle them around and evenly distribute them. The petshops have no say in which animals end up in their shops. Source: I volunteered with a shelter that had a program in place, they were the ones who decided based on temperament\/health. The petshops didn't have anything to do with the day to day operations, really. Its not like they bought the cats from the shelter and then sold them, they had nothing to do with the adoptions. ","1745":"Good breeders don't give the puppies they breed and raise to pet shops. Cats in pet shops isn't too bad, but puppies at pet shops do not get the amount of space and walkies a good breeder wants for their fur babies.","1746":"After 30+ years of having rescue cats (some from shelters, some from the streets), I figured I'd get a purebred cat. I purchased a retired show cat from a local breeder, she facebook-friended me and I not only have a lovely Birman cat, but I have new friends (her and her husband, as well as some of the other folks who show up at her parties)","1747":"Yep, we're getting a pup once it hits 8 weeks old at the end of the month. We got a reference from someone who had adopted from the same breeder, had to answer questions in writing then had a discussion with the breeder before they would take any money from us. We also had to sign an agreement that if we can no longer care for the dog that we give it back to the breeder to find another home.","1748":"Totally true but you can't use a breeder's direct sale to the consumer as evidence that they're a good breeder. Not that you're saying this, just for education purposes. Most good breeders want to screen potential adopters even going so far as doing home visits, criminal and reference checks. Most good breeders wouldn't consider selling an animal to anyone without those checks. If a breeder is willing to ship you a dog just on the qualification that you have a credit card, they're probably a mill with a convincing website. ","1749":"No respectable breeder is going to sell their puppies to a pet shop who're going to keep them in a glass tank like they're a goldfish.\n\nI own a dog sanctuary in Portugal. Its amazing to me that people will go to a pet shop and pay 600+ euros for a pure bred puppy mill dog that has spent a few weeks in a glass tank with minimal human contact. Sometimes on its own, which is horrible for dogs of that age.\n\nI'll give you a puppy for free, thats had far better training, a better diet, loads of human interaction and just all round a better bet as far as having a nice pet goes.

One of the breeders i met with had a gsd, and we had immediately bonded. Sadly the breeder informed me that this pup was already spoken for.  I left their home as i wasn't willing to settle for a dog i hadn't bonded with.  Later that day the breeder called me back to let me know that she reached out to the prospected owner to inform them that she found a better match. 8 years later, still best buds. \n\nEdit:  [pics](https:\/\/m.imgur.com\/a\/DDtHf)\n","1751":"but free market...economy...dogs should work harder if they don't want to be milled...","1752":"> I don't see politicians voting for better treatment of livestock that would hurt production\n\nOf course not; remember, politicians voted to make it illegal to ~~farm~~ film what goes on in livestock yards.

There's a lot of variables. You have to be prepared to take in multiple dogs if a pack of strays gets taken in. Additionally I think there are 13 runs which can accommodate 2 dogs each but it takes a while and good judgement to decide if two stray dogs will be ok to even share a space. The shelter hasn't received funding for expansion since it was built about 20yrs ago despite the city' population nearly tripling in that time. Their funding is so sparse that my mom is often asking for dog food donations too.

The simple answer would be disallowing these animals, but if you follow forums- as I do- you'll actually find enthusiasts actually helping the scientific community learn how to reproduce them in captivity. Also, periodically adding wild caught specimens into current pet industry breeders leads to greater genetic diversity which reduces the chance for inbreeding, and keeps the captive population healthier long term.

I used to have a trio of budgies many years ago. They had the biggest personality to size ratio I've ever seen. My Cockatiel is my best friend. \n\nLittle birds have big feelings!

Little birds deserve just as much love as big birds.","1807":"Not to mention, breeders tend to care exponentially more about the quality of life for the dogs than puppy mills.

Now, many years later, we have our healthy little senior dog who gets spoiled every day. :)","1808":"A puppy mill is a breeder that treats the animals poorly.  They usually don't have a usda license either, though that might not be required in every state.  \n\nwiki \n\n> According to the Humane Society of the United States, there are an estimated 10,000 licensed and unlicensed puppy mills in the United States, in total selling more than 2,000,000 puppies annually.[2] Although no standardized legal definition for \"puppy mill\" exists, a definition was established in Avenson v. Zegart in 1984 as \"a dog breeding operation in which the health of the dogs is disregarded in order to maintain a low overhead and maximize profits\"","1809":"Just look for the helpers, right? There are thousands and thousands of people all across the country dedicated to helping fix this problem.  Through education, by fostering (our rescue won't buy animals but we do take in dogs confiscated by the USDA or animals that are abandoned when a breeder goes under. Giving them to us is cheaper than buying bullets and disposing of bodies), transporting dogs across the country, donations for vet care, raising funds, providing hospice care, sewing coats (they frequently have very poor coats when they come from a mill), fighting legal battles, lobbying, and a million other everyday tasks involved with rescue. Rescue breaks my heart every day but the selfless people who step up to help when I call out make me hopeful for the future of humanity.  ","1810":"> I've been wondering about this. Don't shelters inadvertently help mills by rescuing and finding homes for all their unwanted ones? It seems like a horrible cycle.\n\nI suspect that may be endemic across the board. We used to run into it with reptile importers in the 80's. If your animals are sickly, some people will buy or adopt them just to try to save them. Goodness knows I did - over and over and over. (Six rescue iguanas, four rescue monitors, and a changing assortment of snakes and geckos made college life in a studio apartment ... interesting.) But saving an individual sickly animal is still money in the importer's pocket. \n\nDeliberate, careful captive breeding of the expensive species by serious and knowledgeable reptile people who wanted a smaller population of healthy animals - often so they could sell them to other serious and knowledgeable herpephiles for exorbitant rates, but there you are -\n helped to stop some of this cycle. \n\nBut for animals like iguanas and Savannah monitors ... Well, the last time I looked I had to stop looking or we would have ended up with a house carpeted in abandoned reptiles ... again. I can't even go to the expos any more. ","1811":"shelters are more like a holding area for unwanted animals. They generally don't have the time and resources to sit on animals until \"the one\" comes along, let alone purchase\/bid for them. They don't create a demand because they are a service for their respective area-- for the animals that cannot be accomodated by private citizens. They accept adoption fees to cover their costs, but they don't specifically go looking for animals to rescue, they just deal with what is dealt upon them.\n\nRescues tend to operate very differently.","1812":"Most shelters and many rescues (ours) won't pay for animals for exactly this reason. It's tempting to buy them from auctions because you would undoubtedly be saving that particular animal from hell on earth. And many rescue's feel that those former mill animals can be excellent ambassadors in educating the public about the horrible treatment that animals receive in mills. There are many approaches to getting rid of this problem that include a legislative approach, educating the public about the issue and financially starving mills out of existence. I imagine no single approach will solve the problem and it will take progress on all fronts to make a significant change for these animals. ","1813":"The answer to this is really nuanced because sometimes you will hear people excuse buying a mill dog from a pet shop as 'saving' it. And they are, but the issue is that as long as the dogs can be sold legally, the puppy mills are going to keep operating regardless of what the end purchaser does. It costs most of these places almost no money to run the mills because they don't care about the dogs. The pet stores sell the puppies for a stupid high mark-up like $500, when it costs the mill maybe $15 through the lifetime of a bitch to take care of it. THey'd keep going even if the dogs sold for $30.\n\nWhen one end of the business is so unscrupulous, it doesn't matter what anyone else does. Buy, don't buy, send it to a shelter, they do not give a rats' butt.\n\nSo people and shelters are helping the mills but only because they want to help the dogs, and helping the dogs in that case is more important. The only way mills are actually going to be fully shut down is through legislation like in the OP. Not only does this prevent pet stores from buying the dogs, but it also gives animal welfare groups more leverage to start busting these operations and prosecuting the owners. There are some states that most mills operate out of that have almost no animal cruelty laws which is why they operate with no issues. We need to start making changes at the top, the legal level, so that it can reach the bottom and finally deprive the mills of the means to keep operating.\n\nSo yeah. If you want to help stop seeing lots of dogs in shelters, petition your state reps for laws like this. That's the only way we can cut off the head of the beast.","1814":"Well, mostly they sell puppies to pet stores.

That's why it passed unanimously. 100% Democratic and Republican support in the Senate.\n","1821":"Shelters might be looking into a system similar to what my country does- No animal can be adopted from a shelter without said animal being desexed, microshipped, and vaccinated. The cost of adoption is about $90NZD for cats\/kittens, and when they're sold through pet stores, they'll often do a 'package' where it's maybe $160 for the animal, a discount voucher for their next vaccination, some litter, a litter box, a bag of food etc.\n\nIt *seems* like a big outlay, but it's all working out really well so far!","1822":"Right, we don't have an overpopulation problem when it comes to healthy, young, attractive pets. We have an \"overpopulation\" problem when it comes to people dumping older pets and pets with behavior problems.

It's why you don't get many benevolent dictators or even benevolent politicians. By promising what is right for *all*, those who want your power can just promise what you are giving to everyone to the select few who matter.\n\nIf they try to lobby both parties, they'll just get out bought by groups willing to side one way or the other instead of spreading their money too thin.\n\nif this was a mixture with a majority (say even 80-20 or 90-10) instead of the 99.5-.5 it is, I'd agree it's more likely a party issue and not a lobbying one (like food stamps, which had 33 for reduction, 13 against in the republican party). Simply put, both side take bribes and don't give a damn about the majority of what they vote on, only what they're paid to vote on it. I agree there are exceptions to this rule, but things like NN are not one of them. Now are there party characteristics that help *decide* which lobbyists lobby which party? Absolutely. Without a doubt it's easier for big business to lobby republicans than democrats, as a big business likely lobbies for the same stuff other big business is lobbying for (a sort of constructive interference in lobbying, vs contradicting lobbyists having destructive interference), but in the end, both side's aren't voting for their beliefs, but for the beliefs of the highest bidding group","1835":"They already did that, but then the Supreme Court said, \"No.\" Then the cops said, \"You can't stop us from intimidating or arresting people, Supreme Court!\"","1836":"I used to hate Arby's.

For what it's worth, I've lived outside of CA too and didn't find people elsewhere to be any more or less shallow.\n\nEven among liberals, CA politics (until recently) have generally been dismissed as crazy and not something to be taken seriously. Meanwhile, conservatives frequently refer to the state as a \"failed state\" despite the fact that it never \"failed\" and is doing extremely well economically.

Unfortunately there are also many areas that are treated poorly and have low survival rates and sustainability. But look at freshwater fish, (and bangaii cardinalfish). Many of them nearly went extinct until hobbyists learned how to breed them, and then the wild populations began thriving and conservation was much easier because hobbyists helped scientist learn how to support their populations and even replenish them. There are also species that have gone extinct in the wild due to development or pollution that live on in the hobby.

Britt found 14 defining characteristics common to each:.....and now trump lol\n\n 1. Powerful and Continuing Nationalism - Fascist regimes tend to make constant use of patriotic mottos, slogans, symbols, songs, and other paraphernalia. Flags are seen everywhere, as are flag symbols on clothing and in public displays.\n\n 2. Disdain for the Recognition of Human Rights - Because of fear of enemies and the need for security, the people in fascist regimes are persuaded that human rights can be ignored in certain cases because of \"need.\" The people tend to look the other way or even approve of torture, summary executions, assassinations, long incarcerations of prisoners, etc.\n\n 3. Identification of Enemies\/Scapegoats as a Unifying Cause - The people are rallied into a unifying patriotic frenzy over the need to eliminate a perceived common threat or foe: racial , ethnic or religious minorities; liberals; communists; socialists, terrorists, etc.\n\n 4. Supremacy of the Military - Even when there are widespread domestic problems, the military is given a disproportionate amount of government funding, and the domestic agenda is neglected. Soldiers and military service are glamorized.\n\n 5. Rampant Sexism - The governments of fascist nations tend to be almost exclusively male-dominated. Under fascist regimes, traditional gender roles are made more rigid. Divorce, abortion and homosexuality are suppressed and the state is represented as the ultimate guardian of the family institution.\n\n 6. Controlled Mass Media - Sometimes to media is directly controlled by the government, but in other cases, the media is indirectly controlled by government regulation, or sympathetic media spokespeople and executives. Censorship, especially in war time, is very common.\n\n 7. Obsession with National Security - Fear is used as a motivational tool by the government over the masses.\n\n 8. Religion and Government are Intertwined - Governments in fascist nations tend to use the most common religion in the nation as a tool to manipulate public opinion. Religious rhetoric and terminology is common from government leaders, even when the major tenets of the religion are diametrically opposed to the government's policies or actions.\n\n 9. Corporate Power is Protected - The industrial and business aristocracy of a fascist nation often are the ones who put the government leaders into power, creating a mutually beneficial business\/government relationship and power elite.\n\n 10. Labor Power is Suppressed - Because the organizing power of labor is the only real threat to a fascist government, labor unions are either eliminated entirely, or are severely suppressed.\n\n 11. Disdain for Intellectuals and the Arts - Fascist nations tend to promote and tolerate open hostility to higher education, and academia. It is not uncommon for professors and other academics to be censored or even arrested. Free expression in the arts and letters is openly attacked.\n\n 12. Obsession with Crime and Punishment - Under fascist regimes, the police are given almost limitless power to enforce laws. The people are often willing to overlook police abuses and even forego civil liberties in the name of patriotism. There is often a national police force with virtually unlimited power in fascist nations.\n\n 13. Rampant Cronyism and Corruption - Fascist regimes almost always are governed by groups of friends and associates who appoint each other to government positions and use governmental power and authority to protect their friends from accountability. It is not uncommon in fascist regimes for national resources and even treasures to be appropriated or even outright stolen by government leaders.\n\n 14. Fraudulent Elections - Sometimes elections in fascist nations are a complete sham. Other times elections are manipulated by smear campaigns against or even assassination of opposition candidates, use of legislation to control voting numbers or political district boundaries, and manipulation of the media. Fascist nations also typically use their judiciaries to manipulate or control election \n\n","1902":"I love the BBC, didn't make it about them, didn't throw it up as a martyr story.

Which apparently is ok.\n\nSadly the interviewer didn't press him on why the President can't find these things out for sure before he talks about them.","1938":"Same with his \"millions of illegal immigrants voted\" schtick.  It was just completely a made up thing by some alt-right douchebag that Infowars, Breitbart and Fox ran with and then of course Herr Piece started using.  Literally, nobody has ever actually seen any evidence whatsoever except for one guy saying he has evidence.","1939":"Basically since this whole nightmare started, it has almost literally been Onion-worthy content and saying it as fact and it scares me.

They desperately *want* to be led like children. And if the people being oppressed as a result are the people they don't like... all the better.\n\nSo here we have Trump's fanbase having wet dreams because of all the 'liberal tears' this election created.

","1946":"So, I was coming here to point out \"But Obama did it too\" - but I was going to be more factual in my counter-argument.  The Obama administration did cut Fox News out of a treasury department interview.  Fox News, and the other mainstream media outlets, complained and the issue was fixed immediately, Fox News got the interview, and the Obama White House issued Fox an apology.  The original event shouldn't have happened, but it was corrected and the WH took responsibility for it.\n\nThe current situation is entirely different here.  The WH is not backing down on this and no apologies were afforded.  Good on Fox News for joining the others in complaining about this after the other media outlets did it for them.  Anyway, it's too late now for the media outlets to get their access - the event is done and over with.\n\nComparisons to the 2009 event stop at the White House.  In 2009, it was a treasury department employee that had a partisan belief lead them to a poor decision.  As soon as it got raised to the White House, it was resolved.  Here, though, the issue originated with the White House at a very high level.\n\nI still think it's fair to mention that Fox News was targeted in 2009 by the administration but that's about as far as the comparisons can go.

However, the two things that we *do* have in common are our generation and our fear of the future of the West.\n\nAs 18- and 21-year old adults, we represent a growing and (relatively) socially tolerant generation that will play the biggest role in determining social policy around the world for the next few decades. Trump's election was very scary, but at least it was a wakeup call that our generation's idealism doesn't always match up with the reality that there are plenty of bigoted, hateful people out there. I hope that this wakeup call encourages young Americans like you to ensure that someone like him is never elected again, encourages young Canadians like me to ensure that his bigotry does not spread north, and encourages young people around the world to continue fighting for social progress. Specifically in regards to Western countries, the past few decades have seen huge leaps in social progress. Just a few decades ago, racial segregation was still a reality in the US, women were still hugely marginalized in every country, homophobia was rampant, and trans people were not even talked about. In just a few short generations, though there is a *long* way to ago, consider the progress that humanity has made. Trump is temporary. The effects that our generation will have will be far longer lasting.\n\nI'm not trying to dismiss your concerns. I can't imagine how scary it must be living as a trans person in Trump's America, and I can't pretend to understand that fear.

They still happened, but only up to 160bpm and at max a few minutes. I'm telling you all this because the day I had my mediport removal surgery they stopped entirely. Just like that they were gone.

Some patients were in wheelchairs and had a nurse\/caretaker with them. \n\nAt the time, I needed a proper membership first that required getting passport photos and a bunch of documents including a prescription from a legitimate doctor (so, not a doctor who works in the back and who earns extra money from prescribing it like some dispensaries do).

I asked them if I could get cannabis to smoke after a few months and they said yes and that I didn't have limitations. My medication for seizures (Lamictal) helped maybe 50%. Cannabis was a game changer though.

Remembering I couldn't function and knowing it helped me from that point on is proof enough that it does work.

He saw I was prescribed that and voided the prescription. Thankfully, my dispensary still let me take it because they could see a significant difference in me. When my old neuro came back from mat leave, it seemed like she raised hell because of all these voided prescriptions and somehow managed to get it all re-approved by the hospital again. They did become stricter for a while but I fit the bill and qualified anyway due to the severity of my condition. \n\nNow both the hospital and the dispensary are completely lax about it. \n\nAlso, my friend who has MS which got progressively worse kept saying she can't smoke\/take cannabis because of anxiety as well. I was telling her for months to at least give the CBD pills a shot. She finally agreed and things improved so much for her. Now she grows her own weed and does jiujitsu. She still has the occasional flare-up but nothing nearly as bad as what she used get. There were times when she couldn't move and there was nothing we could do to help her. I'm not calling cannabis the miracle drug but I know that at least in my experience, I have seen some pretty fucking miraculous results. \n\nEdit: I also hate saying this and sounding like an ageist asshole but every time I had an issue with a doctor (whether it's a neurologist or a psychiatrist for my severe ADHD) they were always over 60 years old. It's time to move on and move forward. It's time to acknowledge the *legitimate* results seen in patients.
