","6":"I wonder how many gays ran to their partners like YEA WE CAN GET MARRIED NOW....\n\nand their partner is like..... FUCK","7":"I've seen a lot of people ask how the Supreme Court has the authority to decide this issue for states. For those interested, I am an American lawyer and I can answer that question with some insight.\n\nYes, the Supreme Court does have the authority to make sweeping decisions that invalidate any and all state laws which conflict with its ruling. The Supreme Court finds this authority in the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution and from the very significant court case of *Marybury vs. Madison* which more or less established the Supreme Court's absolute authority to literally \"say what the law is.\"\n\nStates do have autonomy to decide certain issues for themselves. These are judicial notions of 'comity' and 'parity,' the idea that state governments are better equipped to deal with local and regional issues rather than a distant Congress in Washington. In fact, the laws of contracts traditionally belong to states, which is why every state in the U.S. has slight legal differences in how contracts are formed, enforced, written, etc. Marriage, in its most basic legal form, is a contract entered into by two consenting adults, which is why marriage laws have been decided by state legislatures and state courts.\n\nBut there's an important amendment to the U.S. Constitution that (as of today) strips away the right of a state to define marriage in their laws as a union between one man and one woman: the Fourteenth Amendment (and more specifically the Equal Protection Clause) which states:\n\n> No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\n \nWithout getting too much into the nuances of the Supreme Court's varying standards of review (although I certainly can if you're interested), the Supreme Court traditionally reviews Equal Protection issues under what's called a 'rational basis review.' It is the most permissive standard the Court can adopt--that is, it is the least difficult standard to meet in order to successfully defend a law from being struck down. The review asks whether a law is rationally related to a legitimate government interest. With respect to the issue of marriage equality, the question is: Are state laws banning same-sex marriage rationally related to the legitimate government interest of protecting the institution of marriage?\n\nTo that question the Supreme Court has apparently said 'no.' The fact that the Supreme Court today could not find any rational basis for these state bans related to the stated goal of protecting the institution of marriage says *a lot*. The Court is literally saying there is no rational relationship between banning same-sex marriage and protecting marriage. Thus, same-sex marriage bans are unconstitutional under the Fourteenth Amendment, and every such law in the United States is immediately invalidated.\n\nThe Supreme Court has made sweeping judgments like this before, although decisions of this magnitude are quite rare. For examples, see *Brown vs. Board of Education* (which held that state laws enacting racial segregation were unconstitutional) and *Loving vs. Virginia* (which held that state laws banning interracial marriage were unconstitutional).\n\nTL;DR: Yes, the Supreme Court has the authority to say what the law is for the entire nation. Yes, marriage is traditionally an area kept to state law, but only up to a limit until a law runs headlong into the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause.\n\n**Important Edit:** It appears I've disseminated some amount of disinformation for which I apologize (I did not get around to actually reading the full opinion until now). As pointed out to me by \/u\/Armonster20, the Supreme Court **DID NOT** review this case under rational basis. Rather, it was decided under a strict scrutiny review. The majority opinion does not even make much mention at all of the words \"sexual orientation,\" instead focusing on the fundamental right of marriage. A lot of you have asked about the varying standards of review, but I must confess that constitutional law is outside my usual day-to-day practice and I'm doing the best I can to remember the basics I learned in law school. I could try to explain the standards of review in detail but I'm afraid of saying something inaccurate. The least I can do is direct you **[here](http:\/\/blogs.findlaw.com\/law_and_life\/2014\/01\/challenging-laws-3-levels-of-scrutiny-explained.html)**.\n\nBut to go into just a little more detail, the strict scrutiny test is the most demanding standard of review to which the Supreme Court can subject a law. The reason the Supreme Court chose to review this case under this very exacting test is quite logical actually: the Supreme Court has previously said that any law that abridges a \"fundamental right\" must meet the most demanding scrutiny, and the Supreme Court has previously deemed the right to marry as a fundamental right. Thus, because any state law that excludes an entire class of people from participating in marriage obviously implicates the fundamental right to marry, we get strict scrutiny. (FYI - Another fundamental right under the Constitution is the right to have an abortion.)\n\nWhat this means is that the majority made it damn-near impossible for the respondents (i.e., the states defending their same-sex marriage bans) to win in this case. What this does NOT mean is that any future LGBT issues will be given the same standard review, unless they of course deal with marriage. Most likely, any future litigation on LGBT issues will be subject to rational basis review or something that's informally been called \"rational basis review with a bite\"--a standard somewhere between normal rational basis and intermediate scrutiny.","13":"The final two paragraphs of the Court's opinion:\n\n> No union is more profound than marriage, for it embodies\nthe highest ideals of love, fidelity, devotion, sacrifice,\nand family.

The generations that wrote and ratified the Bill of Rights and the Fourteenth Amendment did not presume to know the extent of freedom in all of its dimensions, and so they entrusted to future generations a charter protecting the right of all persons to enjoy liberty as we learn its meaning.  When new insight reveals discord between the Constitution's central protections and a received legal stricture, a claim to liberty must be addressed\n\n> * Many who deem same-sex marriage to be wrong reach that conclusion based on decent and honorable religious or philosophical premises, and neither they nor their beliefs are disparaged here. But when that sincere, personal opposition becomes enacted law and public policy, the necessary consequence is to put the imprimatur of the State itself on an exclusion that soon demeans or stigmatizes those whose own liberty is then denied. \n\n> * No union is more profound than marriage, for it embodies the highest ideals of love, fidelity, devotion, sacrifice, and family. In forming a marital union, two people become something greater than once they were. As some of the petitioners in these cases demonstrate, marriage embodies a love that may endure even past death. It would misunderstand these men and women to say they disrespect the idea of marriage. Their plea is that they do respect it, respect it so deeply that they seek to find its fulfillment for themselves. Their hope is not to be condemned to live in loneliness, excluded from one of civilization's oldest institutions. They ask for equal dignity in the eyes of the law. The Constitution grants them that right.\n\n**Highlights from the Roberts Dissent**\n\n> * When decisions are reached through democratic means, some people will inevitably be disappointed with the results. But those whose views do not prevail at least know that they have had their say, and accordingly are--in the tradition of our political culture--reconciled to the result of a fair and honest debate. ... But today the Court puts a stop to all that. By deciding this question under the Constitution, the Court removes it from the realm of democratic decision. There will be consequences to shutting down the political process on an issue of such profound public significance. Closing debate tends to close minds. People denied a voice are less likely to accept the ruling of a court on an issue that does not seem to be the sort of thing courts usually decide.\n\n> * If you are among the many Americans--of whatever sexual orientation--who favor expanding same-sex marriage, by all means celebrate today's decision. Celebrate the achievement of a desired goal. Celebrate the opportunity for a new expression of commitment to a partner. Celebrate the availability of new benefits. But do not celebrate the Constitution. It had nothing to do with it.\n\n**Highlights from the Scalia Dissent**\n\n> * This is a naked judicial claim to legislative--indeed, super-legislative--power; a claim fundamentally at odds with our system of government.\n\n> * But what really astounds is the hubris reflected in today's judicial Putsch.\n\n> * If, even as the price to be paid for a fifth vote, I ever joined an opinion for the Court that began: \"The Constitution promises liberty to all within its reach, a liberty that includes certain specific rights that allow persons, within a lawful realm, to define and express their identity,\" I would hide my head in a bag.

The fundamental\nright to marry does not include a right to make\na State change its definition of marriage. And a State's\ndecision to maintain the meaning of marriage that has\npersisted in every culture throughout human history can\nhardly be called irrational. In short, our Constitution does\nnot enact any one theory of marriage. The people of a\nState are free to expand marriage to include same-sex\ncouples, or to retain the historic definition.\n\n> Today, however, the Court takes the extraordinary step\nof ordering every State to license and recognize same-sex\nmarriage. Many people will rejoice at this decision, and I\nbegrudge none their celebration. But for those who believe\nin a government of laws, not of men, the majority's approach\nis deeply disheartening. Supporters of same-sex\nmarriage have achieved considerable success persuading\ntheir fellow citizens--through the democratic process--to\nadopt their view. That ends today.

FUCK","486":"I've seen a lot of people ask how the Supreme Court has the authority to decide this issue for states. For those interested, I am an American lawyer and I can answer that question with some insight.\n\nYes, the Supreme Court does have the authority to make sweeping decisions that invalidate any and all state laws which conflict with its ruling. The Supreme Court finds this authority in the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution and from the very significant court case of *Marybury vs. Madison* which more or less established the Supreme Court's absolute authority to literally \"say what the law is.\"\n\nStates do have autonomy to decide certain issues for themselves. These are judicial notions of 'comity' and 'parity,' the idea that state governments are better equipped to deal with local and regional issues rather than a distant Congress in Washington. In fact, the laws of contracts traditionally belong to states, which is why every state in the U.S. has slight legal differences in how contracts are formed, enforced, written, etc. Marriage, in its most basic legal form, is a contract entered into by two consenting adults, which is why marriage laws have been decided by state legislatures and state courts.\n\nBut there's an important amendment to the U.S. Constitution that (as of today) strips away the right of a state to define marriage in their laws as a union between one man and one woman: the Fourteenth Amendment (and more specifically the Equal Protection Clause) which states:\n\n> No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\n \nWithout getting too much into the nuances of the Supreme Court's varying standards of review (although I certainly can if you're interested), the Supreme Court traditionally reviews Equal Protection issues under what's called a 'rational basis review.' It is the most permissive standard the Court can adopt--that is, it is the least difficult standard to meet in order to successfully defend a law from being struck down. The review asks whether a law is rationally related to a legitimate government interest. With respect to the issue of marriage equality, the question is: Are state laws banning same-sex marriage rationally related to the legitimate government interest of protecting the institution of marriage?\n\nTo that question the Supreme Court has apparently said 'no.' The fact that the Supreme Court today could not find any rational basis for these state bans related to the stated goal of protecting the institution of marriage says *a lot*. The Court is literally saying there is no rational relationship between banning same-sex marriage and protecting marriage. Thus, same-sex marriage bans are unconstitutional under the Fourteenth Amendment, and every such law in the United States is immediately invalidated.\n\nThe Supreme Court has made sweeping judgments like this before, although decisions of this magnitude are quite rare. For examples, see *Brown vs. Board of Education* (which held that state laws enacting racial segregation were unconstitutional) and *Loving vs. Virginia* (which held that state laws banning interracial marriage were unconstitutional).\n\nTL;DR: Yes, the Supreme Court has the authority to say what the law is for the entire nation. Yes, marriage is traditionally an area kept to state law, but only up to a limit until a law runs headlong into the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause.\n\n**Important Edit:** It appears I've disseminated some amount of disinformation for which I apologize (I did not get around to actually reading the full opinion until now). As pointed out to me by \/u\/Armonster20, the Supreme Court **DID NOT** review this case under rational basis. Rather, it was decided under a strict scrutiny review. The majority opinion does not even make much mention at all of the words \"sexual orientation,\" instead focusing on the fundamental right of marriage. A lot of you have asked about the varying standards of review, but I must confess that constitutional law is outside my usual day-to-day practice and I'm doing the best I can to remember the basics I learned in law school. I could try to explain the standards of review in detail but I'm afraid of saying something inaccurate. The least I can do is direct you **[here](http:\/\/blogs.findlaw.com\/law_and_life\/2014\/01\/challenging-laws-3-levels-of-scrutiny-explained.html)**.\n\nBut to go into just a little more detail, the strict scrutiny test is the most demanding standard of review to which the Supreme Court can subject a law. The reason the Supreme Court chose to review this case under this very exacting test is quite logical actually: the Supreme Court has previously said that any law that abridges a \"fundamental right\" must meet the most demanding scrutiny, and the Supreme Court has previously deemed the right to marry as a fundamental right. Thus, because any state law that excludes an entire class of people from participating in marriage obviously implicates the fundamental right to marry, we get strict scrutiny. (FYI - Another fundamental right under the Constitution is the right to have an abortion.)\n\nWhat this means is that the majority made it damn-near impossible for the respondents (i.e., the states defending their same-sex marriage bans) to win in this case. What this does NOT mean is that any future LGBT issues will be given the same standard review, unless they of course deal with marriage. Most likely, any future litigation on LGBT issues will be subject to rational basis review or something that's informally been called \"rational basis review with a bite\"--a standard somewhere between normal rational basis and intermediate scrutiny.","492":"The final two paragraphs of the Court's opinion:\n\n> No union is more profound than marriage, for it embodies\nthe highest ideals of love, fidelity, devotion, sacrifice,\nand family.

The generations that wrote and ratified the Bill of Rights and the Fourteenth Amendment did not presume to know the extent of freedom in all of its dimensions, and so they entrusted to future generations a charter protecting the right of all persons to enjoy liberty as we learn its meaning.  When new insight reveals discord between the Constitution's central protections and a received legal stricture, a claim to liberty must be addressed\n\n> * Many who deem same-sex marriage to be wrong reach that conclusion based on decent and honorable religious or philosophical premises, and neither they nor their beliefs are disparaged here. But when that sincere, personal opposition becomes enacted law and public policy, the necessary consequence is to put the imprimatur of the State itself on an exclusion that soon demeans or stigmatizes those whose own liberty is then denied. \n\n> * No union is more profound than marriage, for it embodies the highest ideals of love, fidelity, devotion, sacrifice, and family. In forming a marital union, two people become something greater than once they were. As some of the petitioners in these cases demonstrate, marriage embodies a love that may endure even past death. It would misunderstand these men and women to say they disrespect the idea of marriage. Their plea is that they do respect it, respect it so deeply that they seek to find its fulfillment for themselves. Their hope is not to be condemned to live in loneliness, excluded from one of civilization's oldest institutions. They ask for equal dignity in the eyes of the law. The Constitution grants them that right.\n\n**Highlights from the Roberts Dissent**\n\n> * When decisions are reached through democratic means, some people will inevitably be disappointed with the results. But those whose views do not prevail at least know that they have had their say, and accordingly are--in the tradition of our political culture--reconciled to the result of a fair and honest debate. ... But today the Court puts a stop to all that. By deciding this question under the Constitution, the Court removes it from the realm of democratic decision. There will be consequences to shutting down the political process on an issue of such profound public significance. Closing debate tends to close minds. People denied a voice are less likely to accept the ruling of a court on an issue that does not seem to be the sort of thing courts usually decide.\n\n> * If you are among the many Americans--of whatever sexual orientation--who favor expanding same-sex marriage, by all means celebrate today's decision. Celebrate the achievement of a desired goal. Celebrate the opportunity for a new expression of commitment to a partner. Celebrate the availability of new benefits. But do not celebrate the Constitution. It had nothing to do with it.\n\n**Highlights from the Scalia Dissent**\n\n> * This is a naked judicial claim to legislative--indeed, super-legislative--power; a claim fundamentally at odds with our system of government.\n\n> * But what really astounds is the hubris reflected in today's judicial Putsch.\n\n> * If, even as the price to be paid for a fifth vote, I ever joined an opinion for the Court that began: \"The Constitution promises liberty to all within its reach, a liberty that includes certain specific rights that allow persons, within a lawful realm, to define and express their identity,\" I would hide my head in a bag.

Most people don't realize that there were no honey bees in America until the white settlers brought hives from Europe. These resourceful insects promptly managed to escape domestication, forming swarms and setting up housekeeping in hollow trees, other cavities or even exposed to the elements just as they had been doing in their native lands.

I can attest to most slurry ponds being chemical lakes and that most cows do not ever see grass outside of their feed. The cows we raised were moved from pen to pen based on their age. The pens are literal shit fields that start with a concrete stadium looking place and gradually becomes a floodplain of waste liquids that slowly drains into the slurry pond.

So my granddad could afford to take a hit on crop yield, but for other farmers that might mean the difference between making their mortgage payment and having their farm repossessed.","1658":"The tracheal and varroa mites cause all sorts of issues.

It's actually pretty easy to get a new hive, or dozen, going. So this *is* bad, but not \"oh God, we're all going to die\" bad. Yet. So, uhh we still need to make sure that money goes to honeybee researchers.

In addition, it's harder for someone to be a casual beekeeper. It used to be you could have a hive in your backyard and just kind of ignore it for the most part, and that just doesn't work anymore.

The ear tags are put on them for a reason.  The dairy my sister worked on monitored every single of their cows.  If their milk came back with certain markers, they knew the cow was probably sick - which means they could find her, isolate her if necessary, and give her the treatment required.  \n\nThere's arguments for both sides, especially when the larger farm is conscientious and follows regulations.

I had a very rough childhood because I have a scar that disfigures part of my face, I was teased for much of my life and I was always the 'odd' kid. Highschool made it all worse and I didn't have anyone to really...fall back on. I came from a poor family, my mom was a drug addict, my dad fell back into alcoholism when my nanny (his mother) died. I didn't have very many friends. All I had were my books. I was really struggling and I had a few acquiescence I had made with some goth and punk kids. \n\n\nWell, one day, one of them I'd say I was friends with came to me and gave me this beat up discman. It was blue and silver and covered in stickers. They also gave me a burned copy of Hybrid Theory and told me \"you should really listen to this\".

For as much as people make fun of linkin park's lyrics these days, to someone in that mind state it really...speaks to them. \n\n\nAs I listened to the songs I realized everything they sung about was what I was going through and that meant there were people out there who did understand. They understood, they made it through and now here they are, singing about it. That revelation stopped me from ending my life.\n\n\nOne of their songs asks \"What am I leaving when i'm done here?\".

My 56k dial-up internet was so bad that I had to download 96 kbps versions of MP3s because any larger file just wouldn't finish downloading. When I first found Kazaa, I would see all these \"New Linkin Park\" songs and after hours of downloading, it'd turn out to be Adema or Taproot or something. I fell for it over and over again.

I was suicidal, I had a noose made, goodbye notes written; ready to go.  Around the same time, Linkin Park's 'A Thousand Suns' came out, featuring songs like 'Waiting For The End' and 'The Catalyst' that really spoke to me.  The inner booklet [described how the album was a study of human emotion, and how 'change is born in our most harrowing moments'](http:\/\/1.bp.blogspot.com\/_YJM766qf5ps\/TN68YEQwZ7I\/AAAAAAAAMRM\/8mE_31RQNI0\/s1600\/Booklet-2.jpg), and for the first time in a long time my perspective on my situation began to change.

This post is kind of a mess because I was trying to find information about this show while I wrote it and I kept going back and adding information.  Sorry about that.\n\nSo, I met these guys right before the release of Hybrid Theory.  They were an opening act...\n\n...I can't think of who the headliner was though...Found it!  Looks like I was there to see Twiztid and Kottonmouth Kings - no wonder I couldn't really remember that part of the show.  I was going though a juggalo phase, think of that what you will.  Oh yeah, ReHab was there and at that time they were this corny rap group who actually had strippers that toured with them.  Same songs, but they sounded completely different.\n\nRight - they were opening that tour (I don't think anyone was there to see them, in fact) at a little club in Winston Salem, NC:  Ziggy's.  It's closed now but they used to have some amazing shows.  I saw acts from Hank Williams III to Deftones to Weezer to ICP there, it was a really kind of \"close\" space - just about anywhere you were, it felt like you could reach out and touch the people on stage.\n\n...or at least get fully doused in Faygo\n\nAnyway, their show - this would have been around mid-to-late 1999 (found it!  Looking through setlist.fm - it was September 18th, 2000) was just amazing, partly because of the venue but largely because of their performance.\n\nThere couldn't have been more than a couple of dozen people in the place for their show, but it was probably one of the tightest live performances I've *ever* seen - and I've helped run sound for acts like MDC, Jucifer, Skeleton Witch, and plenty of others - not to mention the shows I've attended as an audience member.\n\nThe guitar player wore headphones.  I've never seen anyone else do that.  The \"DJ\" didn't just do the record-scratching that it seemed all other rap-rock-metal-alternative-Bizkit-bands did around then.  He was live-sampling and mixing the levels of the other members on stage.  The synergy between them was on another level.  The live sound was pretty much album-quality, but it was right *there*...\n\nI told them as much after the show.  They were humble, gracious, and extremely nice.  I told them straight up:  You guys are going to be selling out arenas before too much longer.  I'm paraphrasing here, but Chester said something like \"that would be amazing, but I don't really think so.  We've been doing this kind of thing for a while now and we just love going around and playing for people who are into the music.\"  It seemed like they weren't thinking \"what does the radio want, how can we sell a hundred million records?\" - they were more like \"this is what we sound like when we do what we love, enjoy it with us.\n\nChester and Mike signed two demo tapes for me.  I've still got them.  Besides tshirts, posters, and other random merch that I've been given by bands who I've booked or done stage work for, I don't really have any other \"memorabilia\" - just those two tapes.  I stopped paying attention to them well over a decade ago.  I just wasn't into the sound anymore, to be honest - tastes change.  I still think the first record is brilliant, and the second record is pretty great too - those songs will always remind me of my early years in the Marines.  Someone was almost always blasting one of those CDs during field day.\n\nI mopped so many floors to those tracks.\n\nI wish he hadn't gone so soon.  He was full of music, and poetry.  Maybe it was a bit on-the-nose, a bit too much angst...too much anger, resentment, and other vague but passionate feelings towards an undefined \"you.\"  Some might say that's simplistic, formulaic - but it allows for the listener to place themselves in the narrative of the song, and recognize the things that they're feeling - and know by extension that they're not alone.  As an angsty young guy with too many hormones and too little life experience, it was very therapeutic sometimes to just turn the volume up and scream along.  I know I'm not alone in this either - I've seen you doing the same thing when I drive by you in traffic, don't try to deny it.\n\nIt's just a shame that the man who wrote those words couldn't find the same solace in them that they conveyed to so many others.\n\nI could close this out with almost any couple of lines from one of their songs, but I don't want to pick just one.  So go hit up YouTube, dig deep into your mp3 library, or even dust off an old CD and play a song or two for yourself...and enjoy the music.  That's what he told me was most important, and I think that's the kind of farewell he would have wanted.","1940":"What's sad is Chester was lashing out at fans a couple months ago, because fans hated their new album for being over produced pop. He was angry at being called a sell out and was confrontational. He seemed genuinely angry and was lashing out constantly. A redditor below said that in recent shows, fans would throw bottles at them when they played their new singles.\n\nThen his best friend Chris Cornell dies, and it's his birthday today. I wonder if it was all too much for him. Since he took his life the same way Chris did, and on his birthday.\n\nAs someone that did not like their new album, I feel fuckin awful. I know I wasn't an asshole about it, and I have a right to be critical. But as someone that grew up with their music (Hybrid theory and Meteora were huge in middle school) - I can't help but feel awful.\n\n**EDIT:**\n\nI apologize if I opened up a debate about criticism. This is a touchy subject given Chester just died. But to be clear, I'm only talking about myself on a personal level in my post.\n\nI didn't mean to make others feel guilty for not liking an album. It's perfectly okay to not like art and to even be critical of it. I think we all know the difference between being critical - and being an asshole. Attacking him and yelling he's a sell out on twitter - because he made music you didn't like - that is not valid criticism. That is malicious. That isn't the same as not liking an album, and being critical.\n\nI'm sorry if I pushed this conversation into another direction. I've been crying non stop, and I can't help but feel a lot of emotions. I personally feel guilt - but it's not rational. It's just a personal thing I'm feeling. I didn't mean for others to feel that.\n\nI also wanted to say that, we fans (regardless if you hated some of their work) - should be supporting each other and not taking out our emotions on each other. At the end of the day, we all loved a piece of who they are. We all loved what Chester could create. It doesn't matter if we all don't love the same things.\n\n*hugs*\n\nI love you guys \n\nI'm sorry.\n\n\n\n","1941":"Time is a valuable thing\n\nWatch it fly by as the pendulum swings\n\nWatch it count down to the end of the day\n\nThe clock ticks life away\n\nIt's so unreal","1942":"I didn't know the death of a singer could hit me so hard, I grew up listening to linkin park..man","1943":"I've struggled with depression since I was not even a teenager.

Within a couple of years, I had mostly moved away from that sound, but I've never lost an appreciation for LP. They play music that's easy to identify with and I love that they didn't stick to their original sound. I always felt a gratitude to them (Chester and Mike), for saying the things I felt.

I remember feeling so connected with Crawling, One Step Closer etc. For two straight years I listened to only Linkin Park. Yes it was kiddish, but it helped me through so much. I cant believe that I am crying. \n\nLP got me into music. The guitar I use is a PRS, because Brad used it. \n\nWhat really made LP different? I am going to say Chester. He poured his heart into singing. The guy has been thorough so much. Every single lyric he sang had some sort of angst, and he conveyed it so well.\n\nHas anyone heard of 'Breaking the Habit\"?

It was one of the first times I was really introduced to nu-metal that I liked and I remember being so excited about the album coming out. I bought it day one and listened to it over and over again. That blossomed into my adoration of all different genres of metal, which got me into playing musical instruments. Playing music gave me a greater respect for the talent that goes into ALL genres of music and really broadened my horizon for what I listen to.

Over the years, I have never lost faith in them or hated them. The only album I haven't loved is The Hunting Party. I adore every other main album of theirs for various reasons.\n\nI fucking LOVE One More Light. The band was never, ever afraid of exploring and trying new sounds. Sell outs? Nah, they morphed their music as they grew as people, and appropriately so.\n\nQuick story: my father was arrested for some real shit when I was in high school, and my family's perfect little suburban Americana life was irrevocably upended. This was soon after Meteora came out, and in my deep depression of immediate post-father-arrest, I became severely attached to the song Breaking the Habit. I would play it on repeat for days and days on my speakers, with my bedroom's door shut and locked (the key to open it always available on the door frame, of course - house rules). My poor mother was worried sick about my intentions, obviously. Back then, I wasn't even considering harming myself, but in retrospect it's completely understandable why she thought so, especially with that song. But goddamnit it helped me cope, and that song is the single most important song in my entire life, and a complete demonstration of how music can heal.\n\nWriting this post has reduced me to tears, and they aren't manly tears, they are pure tears of sadness and pain. I'll be selfish here, realizing his band mates (family of choice) and wives and children hurt so much worse, but goddamnit I lost something so special and dear to me today.\n\nI love you, Chester, thank you. I love you, Linkin Park, thank you.\n\nIn case you ask, I'd rather not talk about pops' arrest, thanks.\n\nEdit: missing word","1967":"Went to a high school where all the cool kids wore Jordan's and I was(still am) the antithesis of a Jordan sneaker wearer.  I preferred to wear goth clothing and Linkin Park's 'Hybrid Theory' and 'Meteora' got me through all the finger pointing and ridicule. I got the news of Chester's death while I was at work and immediately broke down and I left, couldn't finish out my shift. If it wasn't for their music, I have no idea how I would have had the strength to power through all the negativity I endured for being a \"Black Rocker\". Thank you Linkin Park. Chester - you are deeply loved, missed, and appreciated. \n\n-Misfit Black Girl ","1968":"A little late to this, but it's imperative to remember that while Chester Bennington's suicide is tragic, he was also a survivor of repeated sexual abuse as a child from ages 7-13. He bravely battled depression, body dysmorphia, shame, substance abuse and suicidal thoughts for nearly 30 years; and chose to channel that trauma and anger into his art - something I could certainly relate to (and admire) in my early adolescence. It was rare for \"Hybrid Theory\" to leave my CD player when I was 14\/15. I felt less alone when I listened to that album. I felt understood. I skated to it. Linkin Park - along with Blink 182, NIN, and Marilyn Manson were much more the sound\/a phase of my youth than Sound Garden, or Nirvana.\n\nWhen I look at Chester's life, the life of a tormented artist - who's effort was often ridiculed by people (including myself in my mid-twenties) who don't make anything other than critiques and criticisms - similar to Van Gogh, and David Foster Wallace (who also took their own lives) I am reminded of when I attempted to hang myself, in treatment, when I was nearly 26 years old - and ripped the lighting fixture out of the ceiling. I am reminded of the letter I had written my mother that stated \"I swear to God I tried\", congruent with Van Gogh's last letter to his brother, Theo - in which he wrote \"The sadness will last forever\".\n\nI think about how absolutely (for lack of a better word) *fucked* my life felt after overdosing, getting kicked out of grad school, and finding myself over 40k in debt. Stripped of the only coping mechanism (oxycontin) I had that worked at staving off the torment of just trying to survive. But when I thought I hit bottom, it started hitting back - and I know, from experience (I've broken a lot of bones), that there is no bruise like the bruise that loneliness kicks into your spine. Shame has an uncanny ability to warp\/destroy any healthy perspective of ourselves, and our ability to be loved. It's like a shattered mirror. I thought that there was something inherently wrong with me - that I was broken\/damaged - and that perspective dictated my behavior.\n\nA common misconception about \"why\" people chose to take their own lives is that they are \"weak\" or \"troubled\". And that couldn't be further from the truth.\n\nTo quote David Foster Wallace on the subject:\n\n> The so-called \"psychotically depressed\" person who tries to kill his\/herself doesn't do so out of quote \"hopelessness\" or any abstract conviction that life's assets and debits do not square. And surely not because death seems suddenly appealing. The person in whom Its invisible agony reaches a certain unendurable level will kill themselves the same way a trapped person will eventually jump from the window of a burning high-rise.\n\n> Make no mistake about people who leap from burning windows. Their terror of falling from a great height is still just as great as it would be for you or me standing speculatively at the same window just checking out the view; the fear of falling remains a constant. The variable here is the other terror, the fire's flames: when the flames get close enough, falling to death becomes the slightly less terrible of two terrors. It's not desiring the fall; it's terror of the flames. And yet nobody down on the sidewalk, looking up and yelling \"Don't!\" and \"Hang on!\", can understand the jump. Not really. You'd have to have personally been trapped and felt flames to really understand a terror way beyond falling.\n\n\nHaving felt those flames - and making that choice to jump, I know (now - almost 7 years later) that it was definitively the wrong choice to make. I wasn't aware of any other option. I didn't know that if I asked for help - I wouldn't just learn how to fight those flames - people would meet me in them. I was terrified that if I was honest about how I felt, and what I thought about daily - that I'd end up in drooling in the corner of a padded room - pumped full of so many anti-psychotics that I wouldn't even respond to my own name. But what I was really afraid of was feeling the weight of everything. Of beauty, darkness, and trauma. I couldn't imagine, much less live in a world that wasn't curbed by something.\n\nThese days I'm not plagued, I still have intrusive thoughts, but I promise, it does get better. I got better because I got (and continue to get) the professional help I need(ed). I feel the weight of everything, in it's entirety, and it is more than enough. \n\nI am no longer sick, **I am infected with the tremendous excitement of living, because I believe that I have the strength to bear it. I believe that you do as well.**\n\nSo if you struggle with depression, substance abuse, and\/or suicidal thoughts I want you to know you are not alone. I know that there is hope because I carry it with me. And I'm not going to yell up from the street asking you to hold on. I'll meet you in the flames every time they rise.\n\nAnd I know there is a chance that the worst day may still be coming, so let me say for the record \"I'm still going to be here, asking the world to dance - even if it keeps stepping on my holy feet\".\n\nFriend, if all we have to gain in staying is each other - My God that is plenty. My God, that is enough.\n\nThat is so, so much for the light to give.\n\nPS: Please consider giving a donation to https:\/\/www.rainn.org in Chester's Memory.","1969":"As a black man, born and bred in Atlanta Ga. surrounded by \"thugs\" and \"trap stars\" who's on the verge of 30 I have a lot to thank LP and Chester for.\n\nHybrid Theory was the first album I ever bought. It was the first time I truly engaged any music that wasn't rap or RnB. It was the first time I felt the urge to out myself as a \"rocker\" - the first time I ever asserted my identity. Gave me the confidence to consume diverse and disparate music and media. It was the first album that truly spoke to me and connected the dots by giving a voice to my own internal intellectual and emotion conflicts. That album is a part of the foundation of me. Chester was the voice that guided me. My modern blues man.\n\nThis is a massive loss. I only hope that he lived enough to honor whatever was in his heart.","1970":"I never really liked Linkin Park all that much. \n\nBut I remember Numb. Roads Untravelled. Castle of Glass.

A lot of people bash on linkin park, and that's okay. But I grew up on these guys. Their music was a part of my childhood. Looking back now the lyrics were a little vague and the songs may not have been about much but at the time they allowed me to make them about me, about my middle school melodramatic nonsense that seemed so important. \n\nMetaphorically linkin park held my hand, and the hands of millions of other young adolescent kids through some dark and confusing times. The light that led us ashore from the darkness has gone out. \n\nI'm sad that one of my childhood heroes died.

We shared a lot of darkness but we were all there for each other and he was doing really well. The last time I saw him was at my 16th birthday party at my house in Dec 1991.

I can only thank the grace of the Almighty that I was never so low that I wanted to hurt myself.\n\nEdit 2 - the reason I mention my faith is that, yes, when I finally got on medication, it helped so much and I'll never downplay how important it is - but getting myself to therapy, and then the three months it took to actually get to a psychiatrist and get prescribed, was a trial.  I'm still not sure I managed to do it completely under my own willpower, and I'd like to think that even if I'm down on myself, Someone upstairs is still looking out for me.","1998":"It's strange... I know many people here grew up with Linkin Park, with them often being the soundtrack to surviving or escaping their darkest times.

I never understood music when I was younger, it just didn't appeal to me. But when I was 16 my best friend at the time gave me Hybrid Theory to try. I fell in love.  Listened to it nonstop for months.  Ended up buying Meteora when it came out and loved that too. Thanks to my love of Linkin Park I connected with a girl I met online, who I ended up dating for 3 and a half years and almost marrying. She introduced me to other bands like Coheed and Cambria and AC\/DC, which inspired me to pick up a guitar.  She's long out of my life unfortunately,  but thanks to that guitar I became an amateur musician, which lead me to becoming friends with my 2 best friends who are my life.

When I was working at the place I worked, we were trained to stay on the phone as long as the person needed us to, and to try to keep them talking if things escalated. It didn't matter if they weren't saying anything, or if they didn't want to talk about how they were feeling and just wanted to talk about something else. If they just wanted to sit there and listen to us speak to them, or if they just wanted to sit in silence, knowing that someone else was on the other end with them, we stayed connected. That call didn't end until the person who called wanted it to end. There were many late nights when I was the only one in the office, and I took calls that lasted an hour or longer, and I was glad to do it if there was even the smallest chance I was helping that other person in some way. I really wish that you would've had that kind of support that you needed that night.\n\nEdit: Wow, thank you so much for the gold! I wasn't expecting that.

Get the fuck out of politics if you can't do your fucking job.","2889":"Though it once represented American ideals and stood to promote freedom of communication, The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has strayed from its original mission and acts against both its own mission and the interests of the American people.\n\nFounded in in 1934, the FCC's mission was to \"make available so far as possible, to all people of the United States... rapid, efficient, Nationwide, and world-wide wire and radio communication services *with adequate facilities at reasonable charges.*\" (Emphasis mine.)\n\nThis is a goal worthy of and necessary to any democracy - to ensure equal access to the best information and communication technologies available. Democracies live and die by the quality of accessible information and understanding of current issues: illiterate and ill-informed voters make illiterate and ill-informed decisions, often voting against public interests because they are ill-informed, allowing outside influences to slowly disintegrate the very freedoms inherent in a democracy. Ensuring fair access to accurate information is a critical part of ensuring the survival of a democracy.\n\nHowever, since the removal of several regulations in the 1980s to make it more \"market-oriented\", the FCC has gradually, systematically, and dangerously veered away from its mission to ensure equal access to reliable information. It has deeply wounded American democracy in the process, and seeks to wound it mortally.\n\nThe FCC was originally bound by a number of regulations - among them, The Fairness Doctrine of 1949. The Fairness Doctrine required television broadcasters, radio stations, and cable providers to both inform the public about important issues, and to do so in an honest, equitable, and balanced way - to expose viewers to opposing viewpoints in a reasonable and truthful manner. The FCC's enforcement of the Fairness Doctrine is responsible for Americans' trust of broadcast and television news. Legally obligating broadcasting license holders to both present critical issues to Americans and to do so in a way that accurately reflected reality ensured that citizens could reasonably expect that they were getting an accurate representation of a given issue when they watched the news. Consumers had no need to seek multiple sources, since those multiple sources would essentially be hitting the same notes on the same issues. Consumers could trust that broadcast networks were accurate, reliable, honest sources of information.\n\nThe Doctrine's removal, and the FCC's subsequent lack of responsibility to uphold broadcast standards, has destroyed the quality broadcasts that built trust in those institutions.\n\nWhen the Fairness Doctrine was effectively eliminated in 1987, and officially eliminated from law in 2011, the FCC was no longer obligated to issue fines to broadcast networks who intentionally represented facts in untruthful or misleading ways. When the Doctrine was eliminated, the FCC was no longer expected to uphold the high standard of communication that had built the American public's confidence and trust in broadcast networks. \n\nThe FCC's failure to enforce communication standards since the 1980s has allowed market pressures to contaminate the quality of news broadcasts. Moreover, broadcast networks became incentivized to ensure that they had the largest audience possible, by any means necessary. As a result, broadcast news networks have become more partisan, more extreme, more reactionary, and focus on their own agendas rather than public interest. This is demonstrated by the razor-sharp partisan divides exhibited by viewership at each of the major broadcast news stations, and the fervor with which those news stations present issues in ways that support their own avaricious agendas rather than the best interests of the American people.\n\nThe FCC ceased to regulate broadcast media against market pressures, and in return, broadcast news has been corrupted by those market pressures.\n\nWithout FCC enforcement of the Fairness Doctrine, TV news networks are now allowed to present current events with whatever partisan or corporate slant they deem most self-serving. They are allowed to misrepresent fact using both misleading \"experts\" on two sides of uncontroversial issues, and one-sided presentations of controversial issues. They are allowed to not report on momentous news regarding American democracy, and instead discuss sensationalist accounts of news for the sole purpose of securing larger crowds of viewers. They are allowed to lie to their viewers in all but letter, and all in the name of profit for the companies that own them.\n\nThe FCC stood passively by and allowed broadcast networks to be corrupted by greed.\n\nBut now, the FCC is ACTIVELY ENCOURAGING corporate interests to corrupt the internet.\n\nIn December 2017, the Chairman of the FCC will hold a vote to overturn the principle of net neutrality. Net neutrality requires that all information be treated equally by internet service providers. In other words, net neutrality prevents ISPs from charging different amounts of money based on the websites a customer visits, the same way that an electric company can't charge a different rate for the electricity to power a microwave than they charge to power a light bulb.\n\nNet neutrality prevents ISPs from charging extra fees to visit certain websites. It prevents ISPs from slowing a customer's internet connection because the customer is using the services of the ISP's competitor. Net neutrality prevents ISPs from charging content providers (such as YouTube, Netflix, The New York Times, and IGN) exorbitant fees to ensure that their content is viewable in the \"fast lane\". It prevents ISPs from blocking websites based on the consumer's ability to pay.\n\nWithout net neutrality, ISPs could charge fees for any imaginable reason.\n\nSince net neutrality is the existing paradigm, it may be difficult to imagine a world where fees are ubiquitous to internet use. Under net neutrality, you pay your monthly subscription fee for internet service. You connect to the internet, and can access anything you find without the ISP charging additional fees based on what you access.\n\nWithout net neutrality, ISPs could charge an extra fee unless you used their brand of modem. They could charge more to access certain websites, or offer subscriptions to the services that they own, so that you don't have to pay additional fees whenever you wanted to access their service. They could squash their competition by forcing content providers to pay exorbitant fees to be offered to the ISP's customers, preventing the growth of non-ISP businesses into the ISP's markets. ISPs could write clauses into their service contracts that terminate your service if you visit certain websites, charging exorbitant fees to reinstate your service.\n\nWithout net neutrality, there is no oversight for what ISPs can and can't charge for. \n\nThe FCC is not only standing aside to let net neutrality be dissolved, but are actively encouraging its dissolution.\n\nIn December, the FCC will hold a vote to to take away our equal access to information, and give that power to the ISPs themselves. If the FCC gives ISPs control over what they provide and what they don't, they will lay the foundation for an America where ISPs control all access to information - holding it hostage until consumers pay whatever price they assign.\n\nIf that's a world where you want to live, sit by and do nothing. The FCC will happily assure you that they have your best interests at heart - as they allow ISPs to line their pockets by selling you your freedom.\n\nBut if you believe that ISPs have no business increasing their profit margins by taking away your freedoms, call your Senators and Congressmen. Remind them that American democracy relies on fair access to information - and without equal access to the internet, there can be no fair access to information.\n\nRemind your legislators the FCC is voting to let ISPs ransom freedoms from the people your legislators were elected to serve and represent.\n\nRemind your legislators that the FCC exists to protect Americans' access to information - not to sell it to the highest bidder.\n\nRemind your legislators to prevent the FCC from overturning net neutrality now - because you might not be able to tell them afterwards.\n\nMore info:\nThe Fairness Doctrine - https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Fairness_Doctrine\n\nThe FCC's History and Mission - https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Federal_Communications_Commission#Mission_and_strategy\n\nThe Best-Case Scenario If Net Neutrality Is Overturned - Portugal - http:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/net-neutrality-portugal-how-american-internet-could-look-fcc-2017-11\n\nWhat Happens When Net Neutrality Is Overturned - The Loss of Business and Consumer Protections, and Reliance on ISPs to Be Trustworthy - https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/national\/what-happens-once-net-neutrality-rules-bite-the-dust\/2017\/11\/22\/d8a50bf2-cfe8-11e7-a87b-47f14b73162a_story.html?utm_term=.552e10266101\n\nReach out to your legislators:\nhttps:\/\/www.whitehouse.gov\/contact\nhttp:\/\/gofccyourself.com\nhttps:\/\/www.senate.gov\/general\/contact_information\/senators_cfm.cfm\nhttps:\/\/www.house.gov\/representatives\n\nTwitter:\n@realDonaldTrump\n@AjitPaiFCC\n@MClyburnFCC\n@mikeofcc","2890":"Can't wait to get a web page when going to NetFlix saying \"NetFlix is unavailable right now because NetFlix won't pay the agreed amount for Comcast subscribers to access Netflix - Please reach out to NetFlix and let them know how important it is to you for Netflix to pay this fee so you can access NetFlix again - Comcast\"\n\n\"If you are Ajit Pai simply enter your super secret code to gain access...\"\n\nedit: added last part","2891":"According to scientific research there is actually no correlation with what more than 99% of the public wants in regard to policy and what legislators actually implement.

Period. End of story. ISPs are notoriously shady, but here are some reassurances Trump's FCC has given us**:\n\n**FTC Privacy Regulation, sec.177 aka Facebook, Reddit, etc. can't snoop on your privacy:**\n\n>Restoring FTC [Federal Trade Commission] jurisdiction over ISPs will enable the FTC to apply its extensive privacy and data security expertise to provide the uniform online privacy protections that consumers expect and deserve.651\n\n**Direct quote from Trump's FCC:  No throttling. FCC release, p.83**\n\n>Many of the largest ISPs (Comcast, AT&T, Verizon, Cox, Frontier, etc.) have committed in this proceeding not to block or throttle legal content.507 These commitments can be enforced by the FTC under Section 5, protecting consumers without imposing public-utility regulation on ISPs.508\n\n**b-but im an ISP I don't wanna be transparent I just wanna bait-and-switch my customers (FCC release p.82):**\n\n>The FTC's unfair-and-deceptive-practices authority \"prohibits companies from selling consumers one product or service but providing them something different,\" which makes voluntary commitments enforceable.502 The FTC also requires the \"disclos[ur]e [of] material information if not disclosing it would mislead the consumer,\" so if an ISP \"failed to disclose blocking, throttling, or other practices that would matter to a reasonable consumer, the FTC's deception authority would apply.\"503\n\n**Specifically good for new media ISPs cannot conspire. (FCC invokes Sherman Act Antitrust Laws, Section 144, p.85, FCC release)**\n\n>Section 1 of the Sherman Act bars contracts, combinations, or conspiracies in restraint of trade, making anticompetitive arrangements illegal. If ISPs reached agreements to unfairly block, throttle, or discriminate against Internet conduct or applications, these agreements would be per seillegal under the antitrust laws.518\n\n**UNLIMITED NETFLIX, and other video sources (Yes this includes porn) **\n\n>If an ISP that also sells video services degrades the speed or quality of competing \"Over the Top\" video services (such as Netflix),526 that conduct could be challenged as anticompetitive foreclosure.\n\n**Here's the big one.  Free Press was pushing hard to mess up the network's ability to regulate and wanted to censor it hard.  This won't happen under Trump's FCC (THANK GOD)**\n\n>We also conclude that the Commission should have been cautioned against reclassifying broadband Internet access service as a telecommunications service in 2015 because doing so involved \"laying claim to extravagant statutory power over the national economy ...\"\n\n**And this is the big one.  Unlike Obama's net neutrality this new system would not only allow competitors to self regulate but if they *DO* misbehave the FTC would destroy them.**\n\n>176.We also reject AT&T's assertion that the Commission should conditionally forbear from all Title II regulations as a preventive measure to address the contingency that a future Commission might seek to reinstate the Title II Order.647 Although AT&T explains that \"conditional forbearance would provide an extra level of insurance against the contingency that a future, politically motivated Commission might try to reinstate a 'common carrier' classification [2015 Net Neutrality Regulations],\"648 we see no need to address the complicated question of prophylactic forbearance and find such extraordinary measures [are] unnecessary.\n\nTLDR\n\n*    Regulatory rollback throwback to 90's.\n\n*    FCC claims the 2015 Regulations gave the government \"extravagant statutory power over the national economy\". \n\n*    Regulatory oversight of the ISP industry shifts back to FTC (Federal Trade Commission) as it has been since the invention of the internet.\n\n*    FCC is enforcing against throttling, censorship, restriction, etc. by invoking consumer protection and anti-trust laws (via FTC).\n\n*    If ISPs collectively conspire to paywall a content-provider, they are subject to FTC anti-trust penetration.\n\n*    FCC has reduced its own jurisdiction, because they're typically geared toward stricter and narrower regulations (censoring profanity on the radio, cable, etc.) as opposed to regulating the entire internet service-provider industry.\n\n*    FCC repeatedly acknowledges that its new policy is deliberately business-friendly in hopes to expand the economy (internet plays a huge role obviously). Acknowledges that potential abuse of this friendliness will result in stricter policy.\n\n*    America has some of the shittiest internet in the world because our infrastructure is antiquated and fiber-optic trenching projects keep getting killed. Hopefully this provides the investment needed to fix that. Better infrastructure means faster speeds and cheaper service.\n\n*    [THIS IS A BIG ONE]  Remember all the Congressmen who wanted to sell out our personal information earlier this year?

Bush in 1988, and waged a secret campaign on behalf of Big Tobacco to derail health care reform in 1993.\n\n>\"He was the premier guy in the business,\" says former Reagan campaign manager Ed Rollins. \"He was our Michelangelo.\"\n\n>Over the next decade, drawing on the tactics he honed working for Nixon, he helped elect two more conservative presidents, Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush. At the time, Reagan was beginning to exhibit what his son Ron now describes as early signs of Alzheimer's, and his age and acuity were becoming a central issue in the campaign.\n\n>But in 1993 Ailes inked a secret deal with tobacco giants Philip Morris and RJ Reynolds to go full-force after the Clinton administration on its central policy objective: health care reform.\n\n>Hillarycare was to have been funded, in part, by a $1-a-pack tax on cigarettes. To block the proposal, Big Tobacco paid Ailes to produce ads highlighting \"real people affected by taxes.\"\n\n>According to internal memos, Ailes also explored how Philip Morris could create a phony front group called the \"Coalition for Fair Funding of Health Care\" to deploy the same kind of \"independent\" ads that produced Willie Horton. In a precursor to the modern Tea Party, Ailes conspired with the tobacco companies to unleash angry phone calls on Congress - cold-calling smokers and patching them through to the switchboards on Capitol Hill - and to gin up the appearance of a grassroots uprising, busing 17,000 tobacco employees to the White House for a mass demonstration. \"RJR has trained 200 people to call in to shows,\" a March 1993 memo revealed. \"A packet has gone to Limbaugh.

Only a few days before Trump's Inauguration and The Review's anniversary event, Thiel attended the pro-Trump and heavily alt-right-attended \"Deploraball,\" which had been in part organized by Jeff Giesea '97, a former Review editor-in-chief who once worked at Thiel Capital Management.\n\n>In Oct. 2016, shortly after Thiel donated $1.25 million to Trump, Thiel publicly apologized for passages in his 1995 book The Diversity Myth, such as claiming that some alleged date rapes were \"seductions that are later regretted,\" ... But three months later, during the after party of the 30-year anniversary event at Thiel's home, according to a former editor, Thiel stated that his apology was just for the media, and that \"sometimes you have to tell them what they want to hear.\"\n\nhttps:\/\/stanfordpolitics.org\/2017\/11\/27\/peter-thiel-cover-story\/\n\nAnother area where Republican voters get so easily played by billionaires using \"God, guns, gays\" and racism to get less regulation and avoid paying their taxes:\n\n>Exhibit 13: 10% fewer Republicans believed the wealthy weren't paying enough in taxes once a billionaire became their president.

But I do have some questions regarding those reassurances:\n\n* What necessity exists for an ISP being able to block lawful traffic in a way that is not anti-competitive?\n\n* What happens when ISPs are behaving in a way that are intrinsically difficult to prove as being anti-competitive? For example, when they throttle VOIP traffic to a degraded but not strictly unusable level, which affects only their competitors, but  they make a thin case that they're doing so for the health of their network as a whole, what recourse is there?\n\n* What stops an ISP from offlining a server that hosts content that is critical of their business practices? ISPs are under no obligation to uphold the free press on their private networks, and such a move can't necessarily be construed as anti-competitive.\n\n* What stops ISPs from prioritizing the traffic of paying content subscribers above the traffic of content subscribers who haven't paid?\n\n* What is the wisdom of a \"regulatory rollback throwback to 90s\" when prior to 2015's Open Internet Order we were regulating broadband carriers under **2010** rules? Why is winding the clock back an additional 20 years wise, when our understanding of the internet and our understanding of the behavior of ISPs has evolved so much since then?\n\nAnd when you say:\n\n> Everyone here agrees that ISPs should not throttle\/paywall\/censor\/restrict our content. Period. End of story.\n\n* If we all agree the behavior is not acceptable, why do you feel the investigative arm of the FTC is equipped to handle abuse in a timely manner as opposed to simply banning the behavior? Isn't funding and growing an department of the government to meet this new demand actually soliciting *more* hands on government control?\n\n* What is the wisdom in allowing them to throttle\/paywall\/censor\/restrict our content, when the recourse becomes *potentially* sanctioning them after the fact? Why should we allow the merits of the issue to be discussed in closed court rooms by well funded teams of ISP lawyers years after the abuse is committed?\n\n* It's not widely reported, but American internet actually entered the top 10 in terms of average broadband speeds in Q1 2017, due in large part to ongoing devotion to our nation's infrastructure - this ongoing devotion which, for all intents and purposes, wasn't affected by the NN ruling, as we experienced a 22% YoY growth compared to Q1 2016. This period, as you know, was entirely during our existing NN regulations. I'm not sure I follow the that repealing NN will have an appreciable affect on infrastructure improvement. Could you help me understand this line of reasoning?\n\n* On \"the big one\" - Do you have a source for FTC's consumer privacy protection regulations that bring you such relief, so that we may read what that entails? As far as I'd understood, the FTC's privacy regulations basically involve making sure companies keep their promises - if they notify us that they're going to sell our information in their service contracts, what in the FTC regulations stops them?\n\nThank you for reading, I hope to better understand your point of view on this subject.","3069":"But in a true free market Comcast and AT&T would fail.

We're protesting nationwide on Dec 7th to stop them. Head over to http:\/\/www.verizonprotests.com\/ for more info.\n\nAlso there is a March on DC at https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/marchfornetneutrality\n\nWHAT'S HAPPENING? The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) just announced its plan to slash net neutrality rules, allowing ISPs like Verizon to block apps, slow websites, and charge fees to control what you see & do online. They vote December 14th. People from across the political spectrum are outraged, so we're planning to protest at Verizon retail stores across the country on December 7, one week before the vote and at the peak of the busy Holiday shopping season. We'll demand that our members of Congress take action to stop Verizon's puppet FCC from killing net neutrality.\n\nWHAT'S NET NEUTRALITY? Net neutrality is the basic principle that has made the Internet into what it is today. It prevents big Internet Service Providers (like Verizon) from charging extra fees, engaging in censorship, or controlling what we see and do on the web by throttling websites, apps, and online services.\n\nWHY VERIZON STORES? The new chairman of the FCC, Ajit Pai, is a former top lawyer for Verizon, and the company has been spending millions on lobbying and lawsuits to kill net neutrality so they can gauge us all for more money. By protesting at Verizon stores, we're shining light on the corruption and demanding that our local do something about it. Only Congress has the power to stop Verizon's puppet FCC, so at the protests we'll be calling and tweeting at legislators, and in cities where it's possible we'll march from Verizon stores to lawmakers offices.\n\nWHAT ARE OUR DEMANDS? Ajit Pai is clearly still working for Verizon, not the public. But he still has to answer to Congress. So we're calling on our lawmakers to do their job overseeing the FCC and speak out against Ajit Pai's plan to gut Title II net neutrality protections and give Verizon and other giant ISPs everything on their holiday wishlist. \n\nHOW CAN I JOIN? Click here http:\/\/www.verizonprotests.com\/ and you'll find an interactive map where you can see if there is already a protest planned near you. If not, you can sign up to host one, and we'll send you materials to make it easy and help you recruit others in your area. These protests will be quick, fun, and 100% legal. If you can't attend a protest on December 7th, you can still help defend net neutrality by calling your lawmakers and spreading the word on social media. You can also sign up to host a meeting with your members of Congress, or volunteer for our texting team to help turn people out for these protests.\n\n","3232":"2nd form of ID.

According to the Succession Act of 1947, the Speaker of the House is in line to become President after the Vice President--true.  However, there are strong arguments that the Succession Act is unconstitutional.  It all hinges on the definition of the word \"officer.\"  In the Constitution, \"Officer\" is a term of art that most plausibly should be interpreted as an \"Officer of the United States,\" which in and of itself is a specific term with a very specific meaning.  What's pertinent is that the Speaker of the House is not, under this definition, an Officer of the United States.  \n\nIf it ever came down to it, and the Speaker was actually going to become President, it's almost guaranteed that the opposing party would file suit in the SCOTUS, and there's a strong case to be made that the SCOTUS should strike that language from the Act.  \n\nFor a more detailed background, see [this](http:\/\/digitalcommons.law.yale.edu\/cgi\/viewcontent.cgi?article=1959&context=fss_papers) article in the *Stanford Law Review*.  \n\nEDIT: Someone made a good point below that whether the opposing party would file suit is more a function of whether it'd be politically expedient.  I.e. maybe they'd prefer the Speaker to be the President over the officer next in line.

First, ranked choice voting for primaries in the state. Then, ranked choice voting for national primaries.\n\nThis is something that I think can snowball quite easily, because it's obviously a good idea.

Then, when the rest of country realizes what it is, they'll all push for it as well.\n\nMake the changes that you can on the local level. If they're good changes, they'll gain traction and start a movement. I think the Green Party is the worst in this case. They only ever campaign for the presidency, which is basically impossible for them to win. They should take all of their funds and use them to campaign for Green Party mayors, governors, senators, and congressmen, and then, only once they have multiple Green Party officials at all levels of government, only then should they spend the money trying to run for president.

","4058":"I also read Linda Lovelace's book and Hef didn't come out looking great in that either...in fact he wanted to watch Linda Lovelace have sex with a dog. If you know anything about Linda's story, she was horribly abused and forced into prostitution by her scum bag boyfriend. Deep Throat made millions and she made a few hundred dollars. Her boyfriend forced her to do a dog porno at gunpoint. And when they went to the mansion for a party after Deep Throat came out, her boyfriend told Hugh Hefner about how he could get a dog to have sex with her. I guess he was extremely eager and into it, so he brought them to a room where him and the boyfriend watched as they attempted to get the dog to have sex with Linda. At this point Linda had learned to scare the dog off in a subtle way, so that her boyfriend wouldn't beat her after. I don't know who provided the dog, but it was at the mansion and I doubt they brought a dog to his party. \n\nThe other part that creeped me out about Hugh is that he wouldn't let the Holly, Kendra, and Bridget leave to see their families like ever. The families had to come there. I recall one of them saying they weren't allowed to leave for a family trip. And when they left the mansion they had to tell security where they were going and it was recorded. They also had curfews every day. I remember the girls had to do a trip to Vegas in one episode and I just remember them being really nervous about getting back on time. I think they were only gone for the day or 24 hours but they couldn't stay longer than that otherwise they would be kicked out or in trouble.  If any normal guy did this it would be considered abuse.","4064":"That was in 2002 and I remember the look on his face, where he was sitting, the whole thing - so you are right - i won't forget it.

Everyone knows Hugh as the old, robed dude that lives in a mansion with a bunch of models but he's somewhat of a personal hero of mine for his contributions to literature and civil rights. In Playboy's heyday they published *everybody* of note, as long as the story had something to say. The counter-culture of the 60s thrived due in part to Hugh's love of the truths we find in story.\n\nKerouac, Murakami, tons of the sci-fi greats like Atwood, Bradbury, and Asimov,  ALL published in Playboy. He even published my all-time favorite author, Kurt Vonnegut, which is why I have [a single vintage Playboy](https:\/\/www.antichay.com\/pictures\/medium\/22318.jpg) on my bookshelf. There was a definite kernel of truth to the whole \"I read it for the articles!\" bit that people like to do.\n\n[Hugh also came out in support of gay rights all the way back in the 50s](https:\/\/www.advocate.com\/news\/daily-news\/2009\/08\/28\/hugh-hefner-gay-rights-pioneer), famously publishing the controversial short story [\"The Crooked Man\"](https:\/\/lostgayfiction.wordpress.com\/2011\/12\/04\/the-crooked-man-by-charles-beaumont\/) by Charles Beaumont. For those that don't know, \"The Crooked Man\" takes place in a world where homosexuality is the norm and heterosexuals are oppressed. It naturally causes a media stir and when asked about it, Hugh simply replied \"If it was wrong to persecute heterosexuals in a homosexual society, then the reverse was wrong, too.\"\n\nHugh's best known for building a media empire out of tits but his contributions to the literary world, counter-culture, and civil rights movements has made him a legendary American icon, or at least he is to me.","4138":"It started to fall off, as did a lot of literary magazines. But Playboy, I think, lost some of it's bite when the libertarianism that had been essential to securing a voice for the magazine was no longer important to it. Younger readers didn't realize the fight that Hefner had gone through to develop prestige for a magazine with naked women and thought, when they first saw it, that the politics we're a little ham-handed. \n\nAt least, that's how it was for me. But as a teenager I still picked it up whenever there was a new Updike, or Palahniuk, or King story. \n\nEdit: thinking a little more about it - I got older and more pretentious and stopped reading those writers. But I never really questioned the quality of writing in Playboy the way I did other magazines, I think because I knew it was the only place a lot of men were getting any sort of literature. It was like Oprah's Book Club for men, but the sort of men who specifically don't spend their days talking about what they've read lately.

He even put our band in a 6 page article in his magazine because of his love for our friend (we felt we were good, but not that good :)  \n  \nAnyway, my mom bought that mag (way over a decade ago), because she happened to be excite that her son was in a magazine.

It was their raunchiest (for their standards) issue to date because the internet was making soft porn mags like Penthouse look like Readers Digest. And this one, although they had soft lenses and the artistic style you'd find in a Penthouse, was near Hustler raunchy. My mom cut out all the offensive pages and left just us and the other articles so that my little brother could read it.  \n  \nAnyway, I came to say that it seemed to me like the tameness of Playboy was the opposite of what was rumored to happen at the mansion. And - at least in the 2000's, well past the prime of the mag, the harder core of Penthouse was in contrast to the total tame residence that was Guccione's residence in NYC. It was a multi-story museum that housed lots and lots of fine art. There was even a golden colored piano that was said to be Judy Garland's.  Bob's big thing was conversation. He'd host a great Italian dinner and talk about world affairs. We were just a dumb band compared to who had over the years: scientists, doctors, leaders, etc.  The man was a deep thinker and I always wondered why he was lower key than Hef.

We'd hide our magazines, comics, a corncob pipe my friend stole from his dad, and other cool stuff that we found from this old (I mean real old, like 100 years) trash dump in the woods. One time my friend and I found an old musket pistol but this fucking kid Timothy ratted us out to his fucking parents and his dad went to the tree and took it out and found our cigarettes. It was an old rusted to shit black powder pistol, we couldn't have hurt anyone with it but *noooo* can't have cool things.

Customers want to be able to go to a place that has a selection of various animals to play with, and \"try out\", they want that place to not be a place where they are filled with guilt that the animal will be killed if they don't buy it.  And they might want a specific type of animal, or even breed.\n\nTo solve the problem you need to end kill shelters and make a good PR campaign to liven up its image.  Make it easier and enjoyable for people to go to shelters to buy.\n\nStuff like that.\n","4351":"Yes! Please buy from a shelter or a reputable breeder. I'm so glad they included rabbits!","4354":"I'm sure some people here are upset because they want a pure bred they paid big money for. \nWell here's my only experience with a puppy mill. Years ago I worked for service master doing fire\/flood work. Had a job out in Alabama for a fire damaged home. Turned out to be a puppy mill, specifically German shepards. What had caused the fire was a cage the new born puppies was in, had a heating lamp (around January) well the heating lamp caught on fire. Burned a whole litter of puppies to death before the house caught on fire. Only damage to the house was a burned up kitchen. First thing the owners wanted to know was if insurance was gonna pay them for the dead puppies because that was \"$10K that caught on fire\" thankfully the dogs used for breeding were in separate cages. They got to watch their babies burn, but at least they didnt.... \nSo think twice before buying puppies from assholes that only care about how much $ they can get for em. ","4355":"Be very careful with legislation like this. After reading the legislation, I think this is a good idea. However, often legislation targeting \"puppy mills\" would also include in that definition professional dog trainers and breeders who may have two or three litters a year, but typically from dogs of demonstrated ability or merit. \n\nFor instance, in other pieces of legislation around puppy mills the bill may attempt to regulate the number of puppies a breeder may have in a year - as if the breeder has any control over that. I support this legislation since responsible breeders should not need to sell through a pet store. But I urge folks to be careful and actually read what legislation like this says.\n","4356":"> Darn it, my puppy mill is going to have to pay $800 to register with the state as an animal shelter.  I'll add two additional kennels, then I'll be at capacity, so I won't have to board many additional animals.\n\n> $800 + a few ongoing costs + some paperwork.\n\n> Well, I guess it won't be that big of a cost.\n\n> Plus, not only is it a pedigreed purebred dot, it's also a rescue dog.  I'll be able to charge more.  I think I might make money from this change.\n\nThat's probably what people are thinking.","4358":"This is a great law and a step in the right direction but does this do anything in regards to the mills themself? This is a great way to hurt the market and there source of income but does it actually punish or target them? Or is this just banning the commercial businesses from using them. The next bill should just target the mills directly those places shouldn't exist ","4360":"Not trying to be a dick but what about people that don't have the time to take care of a potentially traumatized animal?

Wonderful creatures people often aren't ready to care for.","4363":"The conditions that these poor animals suffer in puppy mills is so sad, they generally have really bad health complications, life expectancies are shorter and again; the suffrage they endure is just sad.

Now if we could just get something like this on a federal level.","4387":"Unfortunately it's not always so. My mom is very active at her local animal shelter and to fix the overcrowding issue they passed a new ordinance to keep the shelter at 50% capacity instead of 75%, and I think created a shorter time limit on how long an animal can be there before just putting them down despite having half the spaces vacant. The residents were super upset about it after town hall meeting. Despite being an affluent and actively religious city, not believing animals have souls can foster apathy towards their well being.","4392":"Yes, and also the small mammal pets other than rabbits - rats, mice, hamsters, gerbils, and guinea pigs. And the pet fish and reptiles, too. All animals deserve humane treatment and this should be easiest to accomplish with the ones we want as companions. This is a good first step towards that goal, but I really hope it's not the last.","4394":"Seriously. It's especially heartbreaking considering factors like how long parrots live, how much social stimulation they require, and often people end up getting rid of them when they realize there's no such thing as a bird that never screams or bites (esp without proper training). Breeding and sales of exotics really needs to be stopped since shelters are so overburdened as it is.","4395":"Is there any proper way to have a bird as a pet? Seems like an animal that was never meant to live indoors with humans, but I have never looked into it.

It gets super hot in the summer and i bet some of them die in the back of their trucks :(","4402":"At least for now, it's easier for the majority of people to feel sympathy toward cats and dogs, and more difficult for them to feel that way toward birds as they're less similar to humans. It's very sad, considering the intelligence and many needs of birds like the parrots currently in high demand, whose care requires commitment not too much different from what is needed to care for a human child (who never grows up for the next 20-80 years).","4404":"I don't think birds should be pets.

How people can just be so willing to release something to essentially die (especially rabbits, dogs might be okay, cats MAYBE) without a second thought.

If these mills were a large source of the stock for pet stores, then it will be on independent breeders and shelters to make up the loss.

They are social animals and require a lot of bonding, whether with another bird or their owner. They are also very playful and desire a lot of stimulation which can come from either just scratching and petting and close body contact to many toys and a lot of room to fly. It just kind of depends on the bird and species. For instance I've seen some cockatoos that are very energetic and require a lot of stimulation from places to perch and fly around to toys to play with and destroy. And then I've seen some [golden macaws](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/parrots\/comments\/5o68bn\/everybody_meet_riley_met_her_last_week_at\/) that are so well behaved and content enough with being around the owner for affection that they can just roam outside with said owner without a leash or harness.\n\n\nOverall parrots and birds are animals that require a lot of time, care, and affection for if you want them to live happy healthy lives. It can depend on the bird species as some are more manageable than others. The biggest factor in owning a bird will always be the social aspect though as without that social aspect birds have been and can turn aggressive or depressive if they are separated from their owner or close bird friends for a while (It's not like a dog where they think if you are gone for a few hours it's the end of a world. it's more like a gradual process over the course of days, weeks, and months). But trust me, I honestly feel like birds are some of the most rewarding pets to have if you know what you are doing. Dogs are great, cats can cuddle, sneks can boop, and fish...fish...but something about birds and parrots to me is just so much better than the others.","4476":"Oh my god I fucking hate swap meet and flea market pet stores because they make me so sad. Yeah the cages are cheap and big and probably the only thing I'd buy, but I would NOT want to support them if their parrots look like that. They all look sad or depressed or mentally angry with a lot of pulled feathers or broken beaks. One of the saddest I saw was a toucan who was missing the front portion of their upper bill and he was just hitting his cage walls over and over with his beak. In fact his beak was dull looking and his coat was matted and unglossy. I've seen pet toucans before and when properly cared for they are fantastic birds (Thank you Magnolia Bird Farm in Riverside!) Their coats are nice and shiny, their beaks are vibrant, and their behavior is playful with constantly jumping around their cages, flying places with a passion, and playfully bitting at your hands and fingers in a soft manner. It just...made me sad.","4477":"For some larger birds I have heard that it is like having a 3 year old human child that never grows up in terms of intellectual and emotional needs.","4478":"As someone with a pet bird that I love dearly, I agree. Sometimes I wish birds had never been adopted as pets.\n\nPractically, though, there are so many older birds with no ability to live in the wild for a whole lot of reasons. Their owners die and there are no friends or relatives willing to take them in, they are poorly socialized and their owners get rid of them, they bond to one person and attack all others and their owners get rid of them, their veterinary care is ridiculously expensive and their owners get rid of them, the owners realize that pet birds bite and scream at ear piercing volumes and require constant attention and get rid of them. \n\nFor these reasons I would LOVE to see bird ownership restricted to adoption and have breeding phased out. When I adopted my guy I had to do a certain number of volunteer hours at the rescue (so worth it, and a really brilliant requirement), they did multiple interviews and at least two home visits and I spent a lot of time interacting with the birds under supervision to make sure that the bird and I were good matches for each other.","4481":"> It's a ban on sales for profit.\n\nIt's a ban on sales for profit at pet stores.

Mill owners don't care if their ears get infected, their toes drop off from the wire floors of their cages, their legs break, their fur falls out, their teeth fall out or anything else that doesn't endanger their lives or endanger their ability to produce litter after litter of cute puppies. \n\nWhen a mill goes under or the animals are no longer useful, the animals are auctioned off to other mills or killed. Frequently with a gun or other cheap method. Sometimes rescues buy the dogs from the auctions. The mill owners don't care who buys the dogs, it's all money in their pockets so they don't discourage rescues from buying the animals. In fact, rescue bidding against other mill operators drives the price of the dog up so the mills sometimes actually start breeding for rescue. \n\nIf the USDA shuts down a mill the dogs are confiscated and taken in by various animal welfare groups. Sometimes shelters, sometimes rescue, sometimes both. It's a huge burden for the groups dealing with the influx of dogs because they are all in very poor health and frequently they've never been handled except harshly. They are sometimes very difficult to bring around and getting them to a place where they can be a family member instead of a terrorized and terrified creature can take years. \n\nIt's heartbreaking but the breeding stock in a mill look more like gargoyles than like dogs. If you have a strong stomach google it. But I warn you, it'll break your heart and you'll never look at a pet store puppy again without seeing the image of its suffering mother still in the mill. ","4494":"Here's the thing about chickens: you can't raise hens for eggs without, uhh... liquidating? all the male chicks.\n\nThis is not callousness or a humanitarian thing. I quit most meat years ago and simply don't run into the rest anyway. Might as well be vegetarian.\n\nBut roosters do not coexist. Certainly not in groups of any size.\n\nIf we want eggs, we need hens. Hens have a relatively short working life, so we need to let them hatch once in a while, and half of the chicks will be male.\n\nI don't really know what to do about that *except* to eat the males, feed them to a dog, etc., any of which would beat the callous solution your disgusting local meat farm employs: on a conveyor belt into a grinder and dead.","4495":">intelligent\n\nHahahaha, no. Don't get me wrong, my favorite pet was a rabbit, but they are far from smart. Holy shit they are dumb. Case and point, while my rabbit was in her cage (which was just used as a litter box with one side permanently open) I offered her a treat. Rather than exit the cage and go around, she would smash her face through the wire and attempt to eat the treat. Even if she could reach the treat, she couldn't actually eat it, since she would have her mouth wrapped around the metal frame of the cage.\n\nTL;DR: rabbits are wonderful loving pets with distinct personalities, but intelligent is one of the last words I would use to describe them.","4497":"With the growing demand for designer breeds (anything ending in -doodle), I feel like the blackmarket for pure-bred specialty breeds will boom. ","4498":"Pet shops might be able to source some puppies from backyard breeders, but there's no way they can get the volume of puppies they need without puppy mills. Pretty much by definition, a reputable breeder is one who screens potential owners closely and will take the dog back if the placement doesn't work. That model just doesn't work for pet shops. And without puppy mills, they can't keep up with fads in dog breeds, like all the people who want husky puppies after watching Game of Thrones. \n\nI live in a place that passed a law like this a while ago, and pet stores just stopped selling dogs and cats for a profit. The big chain stores made agreements with local shelters to display available shelter cats and host dog-adoption events, but the animals still belong to the shelter until adopted. The store makes money on it because they can sell a bunch of toys and accessories to the adopter and pitch their grooming and training services. The smaller stores that primarily sold puppies and kittens either closed down or switched to a \"small animals and pet supplies\" business model. ","4499":"Yeah. I would say people who can't handle an animal shelter, should just not get a pet. They are not accessories; they are living feeling animals. ","4501":"Yup. Many shelters don't have the resources to care for an unadoptable animal for its entire life. Also, state laws can make it illegal to adopt out animals with certain diseases, making the unadoptable ratio even higher. Also, I'm guessing that lots of no-kill shelters are limited admission, so they're turning away animals in need.","4502":"I can't even imagine getting a dog from a breeder. All my dogs now are rescues....well, rescues from the street, rescued from the guy that was gonna take them to the pound etc... Full breeds seem to just be TOO much of one thing. \nTOO hyper, TOO barky, TOO protective. I like the mutts. ","4503":"I spent time time in a low kill shelter years ago. Their unwanted animals will live out the rest of their healthy life there, but will be put down due to age\/injury\/illness.","4504":"I'm currently fostering an unadoptable senior dog. He literally spent the first 9 years of his life in a filthy cage. As a result of the abuse he has spinal issues, weak legs, and a broken sphincter, meaning he shits the bed every night. He would have been killed pretty quickly at a shelter, but now he will be able to live out his days among our pets, treated like one of the family. He never had dog toys before coming to our house, and is only now learning how to play a little bit. He loves sleeping with his stuffed ducky, and despite everything he's suffered through at the hands of humans, he's a super gentle and loving dog. ","4505":"I have 2 cats now, but once i own a house i'd love to get a puppy. I don't care if it's from the humane society or a breeder, as long as it's a puppy. Not because puppies are cuter than older dogs, but because I feel that I would want the puppy to \"grow into\" our family. And be able to get along with our skiddish cats. I feel that bringing a full grown dog might be a bad idea knowing that shelter dogs often have behavioral issues or an unknown background. If i didn't have cats already I wouldn't have a problem adopting an older dog. \n\nI don't see a problem with person getting a dog from a breeder for a specific breed they want. As long as the breeder is responsible and not just pushing puppies out for profit like puppy mills. ","4506":"> Breeders are not allowed, under any circumstance.\n\nReputable breeders don't sell through retail pet stores, so I think we're okay there.","4507":"Wait so if reputable breeders aren't allowed, the only place to get dogs will be shelters?  Won't a ton of dog breeds becomes extremely rare if not vanish if that happens nation wide and most people neuter there dogs?\n\nNothing against shelters but sometimes you want a dog a specific breed, and if your local shelter doesn't have said breed tough luck? ","4510":"I have 2 cats that I got as strays, barely weeks old. They are sisters and therefore get along great. They are the most loving, docile pets ever. Almost like dogs, they won't leave me alone when I'm home. It's like they know you rescued them.  ","4512":"If they try to mark up the prices on the pets, people will just get them at the shelter and the store will lose money because they have to pay to feed and house the animals.\n\nAnd pets from the shelter almost never have \"papers\" to artificially jack the price up. They are just \"dogs\" or \"cats.\"\n","4514":"Considering how easy it is to place a puppy or kitten, there's no way a shelter is going to let a pet store take more than a few of them at any given time.","4517":"No. Pet stores in CA already do things this way - this isn't new. California pet stores (at least, any that I have seen all over the state, it could be different in some areas that I haven't been to but I've been to a lot of them) already don't sell mill puppies\/kittens. They already have agreements with rescues and shelters. The adoption fees are the same as from the rescue\/shelter - the store doesn't profit off the adoption. It benefits the pet store because then the person adopting the animal buys the new pet supplies at the pet store since they are already there. ","4518":"Pet Co and petsmart near me only ever have a section where a rescue group is represented and has some dogs and cats available for adoption, no sales. They do sell birds and rodents etc","4521":"I haven't seen dogs or cats sold in pet stores in years, you find birds, snakes, rodents, but not the big 2. I didn't know it was still legal anyway.","4522":"No, pet stores in CA already do this. Shelters and rescues set up agreements with pet stores and it works out well for everyone. The pet stores see it as their way of appearing charitable, and they benefit because the people who adopt the pets then go buy the supplies in the store. The cost of the pet is the same as it would cost to adopt directly from the shelter or the rescue. The pet stores don't profit off the adoption.","4524":"Shitty breeders are just as likely to produce aggressive dogs. It can be bred in.\n\nGood breeders don't do this. If they do they aren't good breeders.\n\nAnd with shelters, you kind of do know what you are getting if the shelter is doing a half decent job of screening the dogs. My local shelter and rescues mostly use foster homes so they have a pretty good idea of how dogs will actually act in a real home.","4525":"I have worked in dog rescue for a long time and I want to clarify that a lot is really the extreme minority. We have seen literally thousands of animals over the years at my current shelter and very few have serious issues. Most are dogs that come from homes that have been abandoned because someone dies or someone gets a boyfriend or someone moves or someone gets a puppy and a 5 year old dog isn't cute anymore. We also get tons upon tons of puppies-just oodles of them, all the time, who do not have serious issues either. ","4526":"I think it's crazy how many people don't check shelters first, though.  When I was looking to adopt cats, I browsed through several websites where rescues and shelters could list their animals, and I could filter by breed, gender, coat length, coat color, eye color, even disposition on some sites.  It only took about two months of casual browsing and contemplation before I stumbled upon the perfect little pair of kitties.\n\nI understand some people are really into certain breeds and want X breed from Y breeder, but I also think it definitely makes sense to browse shelters first, and many people don't realize what kind of amazing selection you can get from rescues.\n\nEvery organization I contacted when I tried to adopt asked me my preference in breed, eye color, coat color, etc and matched me with relatively suitable animals.  It's truly amazing what sort of creatures you can find on rescue sites.\n\nAdopting from these shelters is like the perfect combination of \"common sense\" and \"moral sense.\"\n","4527":"To be fair, you should never buy a dog like that at a pet store, but directly from the breeder. ","4528":"Unfortunately, if folks are looking for a specific breed because of characteristics of that breed, buying from a pet store\/puppy mill is NOT the best way to succeed. Mill-bred dogs are not bred well and typically will have more health issues, in addition to being difficult to house-train. ","4529":"does nothing to stop someone from getting a dog from a breeder, just they won't be going to a retail environment. Which I think is perfectly fair, a good breeder probably wouldn't be working with a petshop anyway.","4530":"I live in the San Diego area and all cat adoptions are certainly less than $100. Free under certain conditions.","4533":"Shelters and PetShops in California already do this for cats, and that's not whats been happening at all. They cycle them around and evenly distribute them. The petshops have no say in which animals end up in their shops. Source: I volunteered with a shelter that had a program in place, they were the ones who decided based on temperament\/health. The petshops didn't have anything to do with the day to day operations, really. Its not like they bought the cats from the shelter and then sold them, they had nothing to do with the adoptions. ","4537":"Good breeders don't give the puppies they breed and raise to pet shops. Cats in pet shops isn't too bad, but puppies at pet shops do not get the amount of space and walkies a good breeder wants for their fur babies.","4538":"After 30+ years of having rescue cats (some from shelters, some from the streets), I figured I'd get a purebred cat. I purchased a retired show cat from a local breeder, she facebook-friended me and I not only have a lovely Birman cat, but I have new friends (her and her husband, as well as some of the other folks who show up at her parties)","4539":"Yep, we're getting a pup once it hits 8 weeks old at the end of the month. We got a reference from someone who had adopted from the same breeder, had to answer questions in writing then had a discussion with the breeder before they would take any money from us. We also had to sign an agreement that if we can no longer care for the dog that we give it back to the breeder to find another home.","4540":"Totally true but you can't use a breeder's direct sale to the consumer as evidence that they're a good breeder. Not that you're saying this, just for education purposes. Most good breeders want to screen potential adopters even going so far as doing home visits, criminal and reference checks. Most good breeders wouldn't consider selling an animal to anyone without those checks. If a breeder is willing to ship you a dog just on the qualification that you have a credit card, they're probably a mill with a convincing website. ","4541":"No respectable breeder is going to sell their puppies to a pet shop who're going to keep them in a glass tank like they're a goldfish.\n\nI own a dog sanctuary in Portugal. Its amazing to me that people will go to a pet shop and pay 600+ euros for a pure bred puppy mill dog that has spent a few weeks in a glass tank with minimal human contact.

One of the breeders i met with had a gsd, and we had immediately bonded. Sadly the breeder informed me that this pup was already spoken for.  I left their home as i wasn't willing to settle for a dog i hadn't bonded with.  Later that day the breeder called me back to let me know that she reached out to the prospected owner to inform them that she found a better match. 8 years later, still best buds. \n\nEdit:  [pics](https:\/\/m.imgur.com\/a\/DDtHf)\n","4543":"but free market...economy...dogs should work harder if they don't want to be milled...","4544":"> I don't see politicians voting for better treatment of livestock that would hurt production\n\nOf course not; remember, politicians voted to make it illegal to ~~farm~~ film what goes on in livestock yards.

There's a lot of variables. You have to be prepared to take in multiple dogs if a pack of strays gets taken in. Additionally I think there are 13 runs which can accommodate 2 dogs each but it takes a while and good judgement to decide if two stray dogs will be ok to even share a space. The shelter hasn't received funding for expansion since it was built about 20yrs ago despite the city' population nearly tripling in that time. Their funding is so sparse that my mom is often asking for dog food donations too. It's kind of mind boggling that a tax funded public service to an affluent town like that can be so barren in funding and staffing.

The simple answer would be disallowing these animals, but if you follow forums- as I do- you'll actually find enthusiasts actually helping the scientific community learn how to reproduce them in captivity. Also, periodically adding wild caught specimens into current pet industry breeders leads to greater genetic diversity which reduces the chance for inbreeding, and keeps the captive population healthier long term.

They usually don't have a usda license either, though that might not be required in every state.  \n\nwiki \n\n> According to the Humane Society of the United States, there are an estimated 10,000 licensed and unlicensed puppy mills in the United States, in total selling more than 2,000,000 puppies annually.[2] Although no standardized legal definition for \"puppy mill\" exists, a definition was established in Avenson v. Zegart in 1984 as \"a dog breeding operation in which the health of the dogs is disregarded in order to maintain a low overhead and maximize profits\"","4661":"Just look for the helpers, right? There are thousands and thousands of people all across the country dedicated to helping fix this problem.  Through education, by fostering (our rescue won't buy animals but we do take in dogs confiscated by the USDA or animals that are abandoned when a breeder goes under. Giving them to us is cheaper than buying bullets and disposing of bodies), transporting dogs across the country, donations for vet care, raising funds, providing hospice care, sewing coats (they frequently have very poor coats when they come from a mill), fighting legal battles, lobbying, and a million other everyday tasks involved with rescue. Rescue breaks my heart every day but the selfless people who step up to help when I call out make me hopeful for the future of humanity.  ","4663":"> I've been wondering about this. Don't shelters inadvertently help mills by rescuing and finding homes for all their unwanted ones? It seems like a horrible cycle.\n\nI suspect that may be endemic across the board. We used to run into it with reptile importers in the 80's. If your animals are sickly, some people will buy or adopt them just to try to save them. Goodness knows I did - over and over and over. (Six rescue iguanas, four rescue monitors, and a changing assortment of snakes and geckos made college life in a studio apartment ... interesting.) But saving an individual sickly animal is still money in the importer's pocket. \n\nDeliberate, careful captive breeding of the expensive species by serious and knowledgeable reptile people who wanted a smaller population of healthy animals - often so they could sell them to other serious and knowledgeable herpephiles for exorbitant rates, but there you are -\n helped to stop some of this cycle. \n\nBut for animals like iguanas and Savannah monitors ... Well, the last time I looked I had to stop looking or we would have ended up with a house carpeted in abandoned reptiles ... again. I can't even go to the expos any more. ","4664":"shelters are more like a holding area for unwanted animals. They generally don't have the time and resources to sit on animals until \"the one\" comes along, let alone purchase\/bid for them. They don't create a demand because they are a service for their respective area-- for the animals that cannot be accomodated by private citizens. They accept adoption fees to cover their costs, but they don't specifically go looking for animals to rescue, they just deal with what is dealt upon them.\n\nRescues tend to operate very differently.","4665":"Most shelters and many rescues (ours) won't pay for animals for exactly this reason. It's tempting to buy them from auctions because you would undoubtedly be saving that particular animal from hell on earth. And many rescue's feel that those former mill animals can be excellent ambassadors in educating the public about the horrible treatment that animals receive in mills. There are many approaches to getting rid of this problem that include a legislative approach, educating the public about the issue and financially starving mills out of existence. I imagine no single approach will solve the problem and it will take progress on all fronts to make a significant change for these animals. ","4666":"The answer to this is really nuanced because sometimes you will hear people excuse buying a mill dog from a pet shop as 'saving' it. And they are, but the issue is that as long as the dogs can be sold legally, the puppy mills are going to keep operating regardless of what the end purchaser does. It costs most of these places almost no money to run the mills because they don't care about the dogs. The pet stores sell the puppies for a stupid high mark-up like $500, when it costs the mill maybe $15 through the lifetime of a bitch to take care of it. THey'd keep going even if the dogs sold for $30.\n\nWhen one end of the business is so unscrupulous, it doesn't matter what anyone else does. Buy, don't buy, send it to a shelter, they do not give a rats' butt.\n\nSo people and shelters are helping the mills but only because they want to help the dogs, and helping the dogs in that case is more important. The only way mills are actually going to be fully shut down is through legislation like in the OP. Not only does this prevent pet stores from buying the dogs, but it also gives animal welfare groups more leverage to start busting these operations and prosecuting the owners. There are some states that most mills operate out of that have almost no animal cruelty laws which is why they operate with no issues. We need to start making changes at the top, the legal level, so that it can reach the bottom and finally deprive the mills of the means to keep operating.\n\nSo yeah. If you want to help stop seeing lots of dogs in shelters, petition your state reps for laws like this. That's the only way we can cut off the head of the beast.","4668":"Well, mostly they sell puppies to pet stores.

That's why it passed unanimously. 100% Democratic and Republican support in the Senate.\n","4679":"Shelters might be looking into a system similar to what my country does- No animal can be adopted from a shelter without said animal being desexed, microshipped, and vaccinated. The cost of adoption is about $90NZD for cats\/kittens, and when they're sold through pet stores, they'll often do a 'package' where it's maybe $160 for the animal, a discount voucher for their next vaccination, some litter, a litter box, a bag of food etc.\n\nIt *seems* like a big outlay, but it's all working out really well so far!","4680":"Right, we don't have an overpopulation problem when it comes to healthy, young, attractive pets.

It's why you don't get many benevolent dictators or even benevolent politicians. By promising what is right for *all*, those who want your power can just promise what you are giving to everyone to the select few who matter.\n\nIf they try to lobby both parties, they'll just get out bought by groups willing to side one way or the other instead of spreading their money too thin.\n\nif this was a mixture with a majority (say even 80-20 or 90-10) instead of the 99.5-.5 it is, I'd agree it's more likely a party issue and not a lobbying one (like food stamps, which had 33 for reduction, 13 against in the republican party). Simply put, both side take bribes and don't give a damn about the majority of what they vote on, only what they're paid to vote on it. I agree there are exceptions to this rule, but things like NN are not one of them. Now are there party characteristics that help *decide* which lobbyists lobby which party? Absolutely. Without a doubt it's easier for big business to lobby republicans than democrats, as a big business likely lobbies for the same stuff other big business is lobbying for (a sort of constructive interference in lobbying, vs contradicting lobbyists having destructive interference), but in the end, both side's aren't voting for their beliefs, but for the beliefs of the highest bidding group","4700":"They already did that, but then the Supreme Court said, \"No.\" Then the cops said, \"You can't stop us from intimidating or arresting people, Supreme Court!\"","4703":"I used to hate Arby's.

Britt found 14 defining characteristics common to each:.....and now trump lol\n\n 1. Powerful and Continuing Nationalism - Fascist regimes tend to make constant use of patriotic mottos, slogans, symbols, songs, and other paraphernalia. Flags are seen everywhere, as are flag symbols on clothing and in public displays.\n\n 2. Disdain for the Recognition of Human Rights - Because of fear of enemies and the need for security, the people in fascist regimes are persuaded that human rights can be ignored in certain cases because of \"need.\" The people tend to look the other way or even approve of torture, summary executions, assassinations, long incarcerations of prisoners, etc.\n\n 3. Identification of Enemies\/Scapegoats as a Unifying Cause - The people are rallied into a unifying patriotic frenzy over the need to eliminate a perceived common threat or foe: racial , ethnic or religious minorities; liberals; communists; socialists, terrorists, etc.\n\n 4. Supremacy of the Military - Even when there are widespread domestic problems, the military is given a disproportionate amount of government funding, and the domestic agenda is neglected. Soldiers and military service are glamorized.\n\n 5. Rampant Sexism - The governments of fascist nations tend to be almost exclusively male-dominated. Under fascist regimes, traditional gender roles are made more rigid. Divorce, abortion and homosexuality are suppressed and the state is represented as the ultimate guardian of the family institution.\n\n 6. Controlled Mass Media - Sometimes to media is directly controlled by the government, but in other cases, the media is indirectly controlled by government regulation, or sympathetic media spokespeople and executives. Censorship, especially in war time, is very common.\n\n 7. Obsession with National Security - Fear is used as a motivational tool by the government over the masses.\n\n 8. Religion and Government are Intertwined - Governments in fascist nations tend to use the most common religion in the nation as a tool to manipulate public opinion. Religious rhetoric and terminology is common from government leaders, even when the major tenets of the religion are diametrically opposed to the government's policies or actions.\n\n 9. Corporate Power is Protected - The industrial and business aristocracy of a fascist nation often are the ones who put the government leaders into power, creating a mutually beneficial business\/government relationship and power elite.\n\n 10. Labor Power is Suppressed - Because the organizing power of labor is the only real threat to a fascist government, labor unions are either eliminated entirely, or are severely suppressed.\n\n 11. Disdain for Intellectuals and the Arts - Fascist nations tend to promote and tolerate open hostility to higher education, and academia. It is not uncommon for professors and other academics to be censored or even arrested. Free expression in the arts and letters is openly attacked.\n\n 12. Obsession with Crime and Punishment - Under fascist regimes, the police are given almost limitless power to enforce laws. The people are often willing to overlook police abuses and even forego civil liberties in the name of patriotism. There is often a national police force with virtually unlimited power in fascist nations.\n\n 13. Rampant Cronyism and Corruption - Fascist regimes almost always are governed by groups of friends and associates who appoint each other to government positions and use governmental power and authority to protect their friends from accountability. It is not uncommon in fascist regimes for national resources and even treasures to be appropriated or even outright stolen by government leaders.\n\n 14. Fraudulent Elections - Sometimes elections in fascist nations are a complete sham. Other times elections are manipulated by smear campaigns against or even assassination of opposition candidates, use of legislation to control voting numbers or political district boundaries, and manipulation of the media. Fascist nations also typically use their judiciaries to manipulate or control election \n\n","4857":"I love the BBC, didn't make it about them, didn't throw it up as a martyr story.

Unfortunately people don't always see consequences when shit is turned into a competition. This is not us v. them when this happens. Everyone is (for now), and should be, allowed to write whatever they want regardless of if someone likes it or not. Thats the *entire* point of it existing.\n\nEDIT: I get what some of you are saying and it makes sense, he's not saying they can't write what they want. That is true. But that makes me ask this: What is the justification for banning them other than he doesn't approve of their content? That part shouldn't be cool no matter who you voted for or support normally. Its something that can get out of hand quickly, in either direction, and isn't very American to me regardless of stance. This is not a party issue at all because neither side should be doing that.\n\nWe have video cameras everywhere now, things can't be just written down and changed and we don't trust things we haven't seen with our own eyes, regardless of how its interpreted, so when someone isn't allowed to show exactly what happened, that isn't cool.","4951":"Same in Ohio.  Rob Portman's team looked up everyone who had requested tickets and canceled the tickets for anyone who wasn't a registered Republican.\nI wish I had known that in advance, since I switched my registration from \"unaffiliated\" to \"Republican\" this past year so that I could vote for someone other than Trump to win the Republican nomination.","4952":"Breitbart shouldn't even be called \"conservative\". that's an insult to every even slightly reputable conservative news outlet.","4953":"Apparently the Wall Street Journal was also there, but has stated that they did not know that some organizations were not being invited and would not attend such gaggles in the future.\n\nAP and Time actually just refused to go when they found the conditions.\n\nInteresting to see how this plays out... by the end we could have just Breitbart at these things (although this is very unlikely).","4958":"Buzzfeed is split into two. One is primarily video and entertainment division(which is also a major source of their revenue) and the other is a news and investigative division. \n\nThe latter is headed by Ben Smith formerly of Politico. ","4959":"Saw one of Trump's explainers, Sebastian Gorka, the other day saying that Trump's statements about the unprecedented size of his electoral college victory weren't untrue, because he prefaced them with \"I guess...\" In other words, Trump wasn't lying about it, he was just making it up. Which apparently is ok.\n\nSadly the interviewer didn't press him on why the President can't find these things out for sure before he talks about them.","4961":"Same with his \"millions of illegal immigrants voted\" schtick.  It was just completely a made up thing by some alt-right douchebag that Infowars, Breitbart and Fox ran with and then of course Herr Piece started using.  Literally, nobody has ever actually seen any evidence whatsoever except for one guy saying he has evidence.","4962":"Basically since this whole nightmare started, it has almost literally been Onion-worthy content and saying it as fact and it scares me. I usually laugh and shake my head when someone takes the Onion seriously, but what do I do when someone says Onion articles as serious stances?\n\n\n... That was rhetorical. I cry and eat pizza at home as the world burns down while watching Disney movies in my cat onesie.","4964":"Think about it. There have been a bunch of people pissed off for the last 8 years because Obama was president. The angered a lot of people, and they've been stewing over it for two terms. Now these guys elected a prime example of the attitude they had about the Obama presidency. A prime fucking example. An unintellectual fuck who can't put together a well thought out sentence. Just a bunch of phrases to express these primal ideas with vague words and phrases like \"they,\" \"you have,\" \"everybody's talking.\"","4974":"> Wow @ the people supporting this move as a win for the people and the fall of \"biased media\"\n\nI think one of the things that always accompanies the rise of fascism is  fervent support from a certain segment of the population. It takes the rest of the country by surprise every time, to discover that a lot of their countrymen not only have very regressive ideas about leadership, but actively cheer when critical democratic structures are dismantled piece by piece.\n\nIn both Russia and Turkey, as their respective leaders have slowly trimmed away democracy, there have been huge amounts of support from devoted fans.\n\nIt really seems there is a particular type of personality who just can't resist a strong, brutal leader. They desperately *want* to be led like children. And if the people being oppressed as a result are the people they don't like... all the better.\n\nSo here we have Trump's fanbase having wet dreams because of all the 'liberal tears' this election created. Seeing the LGBTQs, blacks, mexicans, pot smokers, and atheists getting shafted is like a gift from heaven for these people.\n\nThe fact America is destroyed in the process is of no concern to them at all.","4975":"If he doesn't get impeached in a year or two, America is going to fall into a dictatorship. Lead by mother fucking Donald Trump of all people.","4977":"The President is the CEO and the people are the shareholders.  Trump seems to be living under the mistaken belief that only the shareholders who elected him matter.\n\nNot a perfect analogy, but one that Trump should be able to understand.","4979":"> Queue Brietbart\n\nCue, as in signal (usually signal *to do something*) like \"cue card\", not \"queue\" which means \"line up in order to do something one by one\" or \"braid\" eh\n\nAnd I think it's Breitbart","4984":"Is fox actually reciprocating or is it just Shep Smith?\n\nI'm pretty sure the front page of Fox News the last few months have been siding heavily with Trump and company. Lots of articles about how trump is targeting fake news, lots of \"bias alert!\" articles, and too many opinion pieces about how the liberal media is losing its mind. \n\nShep is the only voice I've heard that has actually stood up for the first amendment. And he's being vilified in Fox News comment boards and people are demanding he leave the network to work for the liberal media. ","4985":"So, I was coming here to point out \"But Obama did it too\" - but I was going to be more factual in my counter-argument.  The Obama administration did cut Fox News out of a treasury department interview.  Fox News, and the other mainstream media outlets, complained and the issue was fixed immediately, Fox News got the interview, and the Obama White House issued Fox an apology.  The original event shouldn't have happened, but it was corrected and the WH took responsibility for it.\n\nThe current situation is entirely different here.  The WH is not backing down on this and no apologies were afforded.  Good on Fox News for joining the others in complaining about this after the other media outlets did it for them.  Anyway, it's too late now for the media outlets to get their access - the event is done and over with.\n\nComparisons to the 2009 event stop at the White House.  In 2009, it was a treasury department employee that had a partisan belief lead them to a poor decision.  As soon as it got raised to the White House, it was resolved.  Here, though, the issue originated with the White House at a very high level.\n\nI still think it's fair to mention that Fox News was targeted in 2009 by the administration but that's about as far as the comparisons can go.  The significance and the severity of today's event eclipses what happened in 2009.","4988":"I no longer think trump is the problem. The republicans are 110% the issue here. They could easily stop this madness but choose not too.","4994":"It is affecting productivity for some people. \n\n[source 1](http:\/\/www.vault.com\/blog\/general-articles\/america-is-having-trouble-focusing-at-work-these-days)\n\n[source 2](https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/business\/archive\/2017\/02\/work-politics\/516120\/)","4999":"Not OP, just another scared white guy.
